Contact the press release distributor directly with any inquiries.\nAlamos Gold Reports Best Hole Drilled to Date at Island Gold (71.21 g/t Au (39.24 g/t cut) over 21.33 m true width), Extending High-Grade Gold Mineralization Down-Plunge from Existing Mineral Resources\nFigure 2: Island Gold Mine Main and East Areas - Surface and Underground Directional Drilling Results\nFigure 2: Island Gold Mine Main and East Areas - Surface and Underground Directional Drilling Results\nTORONTO, June 15, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alamos Gold Inc. (TSX:AGI; NYSE:AGI) (\u201cAlamos\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) today reported new results from surface and underground exploration drilling at the Island Gold mine, further extending high-grade gold mineralization in Island East and West. All reported drill widths are true width of the mineralized zones, unless otherwise stated.\nIsland East: high-grade gold mineralization extended 20 metres (\u201cm\u201d) east from the nearest Inferred Mineral Resource block, over significantly greater widths. This included the best hole drilled to date, 45 m down-plunge from the previous best surface directional hole MH25-04 (28.97 g/t Au (27.96 g/t cut) over 21.76 m). MH25-08 and the previously reported MH25-04 have true widths approximately four times greater than the average width of the large high-grade Inferred Resource block up-plunge, demonstrating the zone has widened in this area. New highlights include:\n71.21 g/t Au (39.24 g/t cut) over 21.33 m (MH25-08); and\n34.87 g/t Au (34.87 g/t cut) over 5.98 m (MH25-07).\nIsland West: underground directional drilling extended high-grade gold mineralization 50 m below the nearest Inferred Mineral Resource block and partially closed the 185 m gap between two high-grade Inferred Mineral Resource blocks. New highlights include:\n31.58 g/t Au (28.74 g/t cut) over 2.43 m (740-471-41).\nNote: Drillhole composite intervals reported as \u201ccut\u201d may include higher grade samples which have been cut to 185 g/t Au for the Island East Area, and 225 g/t for Island Main and West.\n\u201cOver the past year, ongoing exploration success has driven another one million ounce increase in Mineral Reserves and Resources at Island Gold and returned the two best intersections to date. We expect these new results to drive further Mineral Resource growth in one of the highest grade portions of the ore body. This already large Mineral Resource block in Island East is in proximity to the planned shaft and remains open laterally and down-plunge demonstrating further significant upside to the Phase III Expansion,\u201d said John A. McCluskey, President and Chief Executive Officer.\n2021 Exploration Drilling Program \u2013 Island Gold Mine\nA total of $25 million is budgeted in 2021 for surface and underground exploration at Island Gold, up from $13 million spent in 2020. The focus remains on continuing to define new near mine Mineral Resources across the two-kilometre long Island Gold Main Zone, as well as advancing and evaluating several regional targets. The 2021 exploration budget includes 27,500 m of surface directional drilling, 24,000 m of underground directional drilling, 28,000 m of underground exploration drilling, and 900 m of underground exploration development to extend drill platforms on the 620, 790, and 840-levels. A 25,000 m regional exploration drill program is also planned in 2021, significantly larger than in previous years.\nA total of 6,683 m of surface directional diamond drilling, 3,233 m of underground directional drilling and 8,948 m of standard underground exploration diamond drilling has been completed as of May 31, 2021. Assays remain pending on a significant portion of this drilling; however, the turnaround time from assay laboratories has improved over the past several weeks.\nNew highlight intercepts can be found in Tables 1 and 2, and in Figures 1 and 2 at the end of this news release.\nIsland East\nSurface Directional Drilling\nSurface directional drilling continues to extend high-grade gold mineralization beyond Mineral Resource blocks in the lower portions of Island East with drill hole spacing ranging from 50 m to 100 m (Figures 1 and 2).\nNew highlights from the drilling program include (E1E-Zone) (Table 1):\n71.21 g/t Au (39.24 g/t cut) over 21.33 m (MH25-08); and\n34.87 g/t Au (34.87 g/t cut) over 5.98 m (MH25-07).\nDrillhole MH25-08 (71.21 g/t Au (39.24 g/t cut) over 21.33 m) intersected significantly wider, high-grade mineralization 45 m and 80 m from previously reported drillholes MH25-04 (28.97 g/t Au (27.96 g/t cut) over 21.76 m) and MH25-05 (54.18 g/t Au (33.12 g/t cut) over 6.54 m), respectively.\nIn addition, drillhole MH25-08 extended high-grade mineralization 20 m east of the existing Inferred Mineral Resource block which contained 1,309,700 ounces, grading 18.26 g/t Au (2.23 million tonnes) as of December 31, 2020. Using the cut weighted gold grade for metal factor calculation, drillhole MH25-08(71.21 g/t Au (39.24 g/t cut) over 21.33 m) is the best hole drilled to date at Island Gold in terms of gold content for a drill hole intersect. Drillhole MH25-07 (34.87 g/t Au (34.87 g/t cut) over 5.98 m) also further extended high-grade mineralization at Island East, intersecting high-grade mineralization 60 m above MH25-04, and 40 m from the nearest Inferred Mineral Resource block.\nUnderground Exploration Drilling\nUnderground drilling from the 840-level exploration drift continues to extend high-grade mineralization and close the gap between Mineral Reserves and Resources in the upper and middle portions of Island East (between depths of 850 m and 1,100 m). New highlights include (E1E-Zone) (Table 2):\n8.88 g/t Au (8.88 g/t cut) over 8.45 m (840-584-03); and\n16.75 g/t Au (16.75 g/t cut) over 2.64 m (840-590-10).\nIsland West\nUnderground directional drilling extended high-grade mineralization 50 m beyond existing Mineral Resources and partially closed the 185 m gap between Inferred Mineral Resource blocks in Island West which contained 454,300 ounces, grading 15.83 g/t Au (0.9 million tonnes) as of December 31, 2020. New highlights include (Table 1 and Figure 1):\n31.58 g/t Au (28.74 g/t cut) over 2.43 m (740-471-41).\nQualified Persons\nChris Bostwick, FAusIMM, Alamos Gold\u2019s Vice President, Technical Services, has reviewed and approved the scientific and technical information contained in this news release.

We started with a small high-grade deposit and now, with the discovery of and subsequent drilling on the Tabasco/Cayenne and Area 51 zones, we have a multi-million-ounce deposit amenable to potential open pit and underground bulk mining,\u201d said Marz Kord, President & CEO of Wallbridge. \"Together with an updated MRE for Martiniere, which is located 30 km west of Fenelon, the Fenelon MRE strengthens our vision of establishing multiple gold producing assets sharing centralized infrastructure on the Detour-Fenelon Gold Trend. These two gold deposits remain open in multiple directions laterally and at depth indicating significant potential for expansion. Our next step is additional drilling to add to these resources prior to proceeding with an economic study and to identify new mineralization elsewhere on the Detour-Fenelon Gold Trend.\"\nAttila P\u00e9ntek, Vice President Exploration of Wallbridge, added: \u201cThat over 60% of the mineral resource is classified as Indicated is a testament to the quality of the Fenelon deposit with good geologic continuities and all the zones being situated close to each other allowing for efficient, cost-effective drilling. We are also very pleased with the increase in the Martiniere mineral resource from the previous MRE, completed in 2018, and our ongoing drill program has already demonstrated excellent potential for Martiniere to become our next significant gold deposit. We are proud of the tremendous effort of our team and contractors for advancing Fenelon from gold discovery to this significant MRE in less than three years, with the added challenge of doing so during a pandemic.\u201d\nFigure 1. Wallbridge\u2019s Detour-Fenelon Gold Trend land package\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/0f9b3374-5cb9-476f-81d5-2755d8fbe575\nMineral Resource Expansion Potential\nThere is significant potential to further expand mineral resources at both Fenelon and Martiniere as:\n-\nThe current Area 51 gold resource is open to the west and to the south, where gold mineralization is known to extend for 800 m, all the way to the Sunday Lake deformation zone (see Figure 2).\n-\nBoth Area 51 and Tabasco/Cayenne zones are open below 1,000 m depth and are known to extend as far as 1,500 m below surface (see Figure 3).\n-\nSeveral isolated zones at Martiniere could be combined into one or two deposits with more tightly-spaced drilling (see Figure 4).\n-\nDrilling is extending mineralization to depth at Martiniere (see Figure 5).\nMineral Resource Estimation Methodology\nThe maiden MRE for Fenelon is based on 1,040 recent and historic drill holes totaling approximately 358,000 m, variably spaced from 20 to 200 m on the Gabbro, Tabasco/Cayenne and Area 51 zones. This includes 650 drill holes totaling approximately 292,000 m drilled by Wallbridge since 2016 on the Tabasco/Cayenne and Area 51 zones.\nThe updated MRE for Martiniere is based on 111 recent and historic drill holes totaling over 40,000 m, variably spaced from 20 to 150 m on the Martiniere North, Martiniere West, Bug Lake and Horsefly zones. None of the holes drilled to date by Wallbridge since the acquisition of Balmoral have been incorporated into the Martiniere MRE.\nFor both deposits, the geological, litho-structural, and 3D modelling of the mineralized zones was prepared in Leapfrog Geo and the mineral resource estimates were prepared in Leapfrog Edge using a sub-block model of 6m x 6m x 6m parent blocks. Gold grades were calculated using the Ordinary Kriging interpolation method for Fenelon and the Inverse Distance-squared method using hard boundaries for Martiniere.\nThe mineral resources are categorized as Indicated and Inferred based on drill spacing, as well as geological and grade continuity. For Fenelon, in the Tabasco/Cayenne Zones, a maximum distance to the closest composite of 35 m for Indicated and 70 m for Inferred while 25 m was used for Indicated and 50 m for Inferred in all other zones. For Martiniere, maximum distance to the closest composite was 35 m for Indicated and 70 m for Inferred.\nThe reasonable prospect for an eventual economical extraction is met by having used reasonable cut-off grades both for a potential open pit and underground extraction scenarios, a minimum width, and constraining volumes (Deswik shapes and optimized pit-shell).

Geo. (For Fenelon and Martiniere) and Mr. Vincent Nadeau-Benoit, P.Geo. (For Fenelon), both from InnovExplo. The MREs follow 2014 CIM Definition Standards and the 2019 CIM MRMR Best Practice Guidelines.\n-\nThese mineral resources are not mineral reserves as they do not have demonstrated economic viability.\n-\nThe qualified persons are not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title-related, taxation, socio-political or marketing issues, or any other relevant issue, that could materially affect the potential development of mineral resources other than those discussed in the MRE.\n-\nFor Fenelon, a density value of 2.80 g/cm3, supported by measurements, was applied to the bedrock. Sixty-one high-grade zones and five low-grade envelopes were modelled in 3D using a minimum true width of 2.0 m. High-grade capping was done on raw assay data and established on a per-zone basis and ranges between 25 g/t and 110 g/t Au (except Gabbro zones where it ranged from 35 g/t to 330 g/t) for the high-grade zones and ranges between 8 g/t and 35 g/t Au for the low-grade envelopes. Composites (1.5 m) were calculated within the zones and envelopes using the grade of the adjacent material when assayed or a value of zero when not assayed.\n-\nFor Martiniere, a density value of 2.80 g/cm3, supported by measurements, was applied to the bedrock. Fifty-nine high-grade zones and one low-grade envelope were modelled in 3D using a minimum true width of 3.0 m. High-grade capping was done on raw assay data and established at 35 g/t Au based on the most numerous zones and extrapolated to all zones. Composites (1.0 m) were calculated within the zones and envelopes using the grade of the adjacent material when assayed or a value of zero when not assayed.\n-\nThe reasonable prospect for eventual economic extraction is met by having constraining volumes applied to any blocks (potential surface or underground extraction scenario) using Whittle and the Deswik Stope Optimizer (DSO) and by the application of cut-off grades, as shown in the above table, were calculated using a gold price of US $ 1,607 / oz and an Exchange rate of US $ 1.31 / CAD $.\n-\nResults are presented in-situ. Ounce (troy) = metric tons x grade / 31.10348. The number of tonnes and ounces was rounded to the nearest thousand. Any discrepancies in the totals are due to rounding effects; rounding followed the recommendations as per NI 43-101.\nThe sensitivity of the cut-off grades on the mineral resources of the Fenelon and Martiniere gold project is presented below:\nSensitivity in-pit Fenelon\n| Cut-off Grade | Gabbro | Tabasco-Cayenne | Area 51 | ||||||\n| Metric | Grade | Troy | Metric | Grade | Troy | Metric | Grade | Troy | |\n| INDICATED | |||||||||\n| 0.30 | 586,200 | 3.95 | 74,500 | 14,055,200 | 1.64 | 739,100 | 17,298,700 | 0.96 | 533,700 |\n| 0.35 | 555,900 | 4.15 | 74,200 | 12,706,500 | 1.77 | 725,000 | 14,869,600 | 1.06 | 508,400 |\n| 0.40 | 532,200 | 4.32 | 73,900 | 11,644,000 | 1.90 | 712,200 | 12,911,400 | 1.17 | 484,900 |\n| 0.50 | 492,300 | 4.63 | 73,300 | 10,016,200 | 2.14 | 688,800 | 10,115,800 | 1.37 | 444,700 |\n| 1.00 | 355,200 | 6.14 | 70,100 | 5,625,000 | 3.26 | 588,800 | 4,582,500 | 2.18 | 320,900 |\n| 1.50 | 277,500 | 7.52 | 67,100 | 3,786,600 | 4.25 | 517,100 | 2,816,800 | 2.79 | 252,300 |\n| 2.50 | 199,800 | 9.69 | 62,300 | 2,234,900 | 5.86 | 421,000 | 1,264,500 | 3.85 | 156,500 |\n| INFERRED | |||||||||\n| 0.30 | - | - | - | 7,738,800 | 0.92 | 229,900 | 17,968,700 | 1.12 | 649,100 |\n| 0.35 | - | - | - | 6,878,100 | 1.00 | 220,900 | 15,224,300 | 1.27 | 620,500 |\n| 0.40 | - | - | - | 6,214,500 | 1.07 | 212,900 | 13,270,000 | 1.40 | 597,100 |\n| 0.50 | - | - | - | 4,987,400 | 1.22 | 195,200 | 10,441,800 | 1.66 | 556,400 |\n| 1.00 | - | - | - | 2,016,500 | 1.99 | 128,900 | 4,920,600 | 2.75 | 435,500 |\n| 1.50 | - | - | - | 1,107,500 | 2.61 | 93,000 | 3,566,100 | 3.33 | 382,400 |\n| 2.50 | - | - | - | 459,700 | 3.60 | 53,100 | 1,919,100 | 4.52 | 279,100 |\nSensitivity underground Fenelon\n| Cut-off Grade | Fenelon (All zones) | ||\n| Metric | Grade | Troy Ounces | |\n| INDICATED | |||\n| 1.25 | 9,453,900 | 2.98 | 904,500 |\n| 1.50 | 7,847,800 | 3.27 | 825,600 |\n| 1.75 | 6,773,100 | 3.57 | 777,500 |\n| 2.00 | 5,718,900 | 3.89 | 715,000 |\n| 2.50 | 4,223,900 | 4.50 | 610,700 |\n| INFERRED | |||\n| 1.25 | 8,891,500 | 2.47 | 707,300 |\n| 1.50 | 6,926,900 | 2.78 | 619,800 |\n| 1.75 | 5,730,600 | 3.05 | 561,500 |\n| 2.00 | 4,685,500 | 3.32 | 499,500 |\n| 2.50 | 2,982,700 | 3.96 | 379,800 |\nSensitivity in-pit Martiniere\n| Cut-off Grade | Martiniere North | Martiniere West | Horsefly | Bug Lake | ||||||||\n| Metric | Grade | Troy | Metric | Grade | Troy | Metric | Grade | Troy | Metric | Grade | Troy | |\n| INDICATED | ||||||||||||\n| 0.30 | 150,600 | 2.59 | 12,600 | 809,800 | 2.16 | 56,100 | - | 6,147,600 | 1.82 | 360,000 | ||\n| 0.35 | 144,800 | 2.68 | 12,500 | 778,600 | 2.23 | 55,800 | - | 5,911,400 | 1.88 | 357,600 | ||\n| 0.40 | 137,300 | 2.81 | 12,400 | 746,300 | 2.31 | 55,400 | - | 5,699,400 | 1.94 | 355,000 | ||\n| 0.50 | 124,100 | 3.06 | 12,200 | 681,300 | 2.49 | 54,500 | - | 5,275,700 | 2.06 | 348,900 | ||\n| 1.00 | 74,000 | 4.63 | 11,000 | 493,600 | 3.15 | 50,100 | - | 3,652,600 | 2.65 | 310,700 | ||\n| 1.50 | 60,400 | 5.39 | 10,500 | 378,100 | 3.74 | 45,400 | - | 2,479,000 | 3.31 | 264,000 | ||\n| 2.40 | 42,900 | 6.86 | 9,500 | 256,500 | 4.60 | 37,900 | - | 1,314,600 | 4.58 | 193,400 | ||\n| INFERRED | ||||||||||||\n| 0.30 | 173,700 | 2.51 | 14,000 | 66,400 | 0.98 | 2,100 | 26,000 | 2.17 | 1,800 | 1,275,300 | 1.6 | 65,500 |\n| 0.35 | 161,000 | 2.68 | 13,900 | 59,100 | 1.06 | 2,000 | 26,000 | 2.17 | 1,800 | 1,217,900 | 1.66 | 64,900 |\n| 0.40 | 153,800 | 2.79 | 13,800 | 52,700 | 1.15 | 1,900 | 26,000 | 2.17 | 1,800 | 1,174,100 | 1.71 | 64,400 |\n| 0.50 | 146,600 | 2.90 | 13,700 | 43,100 | 1.30 | 1,800 | 26,000 | 2.17 | 1,800 | 1,088,700 | 1.80 | 63,100 |\n| 1.00 | 91,800 | 4.22 | 12,400 | 15,000 | 2.57 | 1,200 | 24,500 | 2.25 | 1,800 | 795,700 | 2.20 | 56,400 |\n| 1.50 | 73,500 | 4.97 | 11,700 | 10,800 | 3.08 | 1,100 | 20,800 | 2.43 | 1,600 | 542,900 | 2.65 | 46,300 |\n| 2.40 | 67,300 | 5.25 | 11,400 | 8,300 | 3.43 | 900 | 10,600 | 2.94 | 1,000 | 262,600 | 3.52 | 29,700 |\nSensitivity underground Martiniere\n| Cut-off Grade | MARTINIERE | ||\n| Metric | Grade | Troy | |\n| INDICATED | |||\n| 2.00 | 1,274,100 | 3.57 | 146,300 |\n| 2.40 | 933,500 | 4.10 | 122,900 |\n| 3.00 | 619,800 | 4.89 | 97,400 |\n| INFERRED | |||\n| 2.00 | 1,847,000 | 3.42 | 203,100 |\n| 2.40 | 1,396,600 | 3.84 | 172,300 |\n| 3.00 | 911,800 | 4.51 | 132,300 |\nThe tables above illustrate the sensitivity of each MRE to different cut-off grades for a potential open-pit and underground operation scenario with reasonable outlook for economic extraction.

Geo. (InnovExplo Inc.). The effective date of the estimate is November 9, 2021.\n-\nThese mineral resources are not mineral reserves as they do not have demonstrated economic viability.\n-\nThe mineral resource estimate follows 2014 CIM Definition Standards and the 2019 CIM MRMR Best Practice Guidelines.\n-\nTwo mineralized zones were modelled in 3D using a minimum true width of 3.0 m. Density values are interpolated from density databases, capped at 4.697 g/cm3\n-\nHigh-grade capping was done on raw assay data and established on a per zone basis for nickel (15.00%), copper (5.00%), platinum (5.00g/t) and palladium (8.00g/t). Composites (1-m) were calculated within the zones using the grade of the adjacent material when assayed or a value of zero when not assayed.\n-\nThe estimate was completed using a block model in GEMS (v.6.8) using 5m x 5m x 5m blocks. Grade interpolation (Ni, Cu, Co, Pt, Pd, Au, and Ag) was obtained by ID2 using hard boundaries. Results in NiEq were calculated after interpolation of the individual metals.\n-\nThe mineral resources are categorized as Indicated and Inferred based on drill spacing, geological and grade continuity. A maximum distance to the closest composite of 50 m was used for Indicated mineral resources and 100 m for the Inferred mineral resources.\n-\nThe reasonable prospect for eventual economic extraction is met by having constraining volumes applied to any blocks (potential underground extraction scenario) using the Deswik Stope Optimizer (DSO) and by the application of a cut off grade of 0.80% NiEq. Cut-off calculations used: Mining = $65.00/t; Maintenance = $10.00/t; G&A = $20.00/t, Processing = $42.00/t. The cut-off grades should be re-evaluated in light of future prevailing market conditions (metal prices, exchange rate, mining cost, etc.). The NiEq formula used a USD:CAD exchange rate of 1.31, nickel price of US$6.51/lb, copper price of US$2.75/lb, cobalt price of US$14.48/lb, platinum price of US$887.68/oz, and palladium price of US$2,017.31/oz. Gold and silver does not contribute to the economics of the deposit.\n-\nResults are presented undiluted and in-situ. Ounce (troy) = metric tons x grade / 31.10348. Metric tons and ounces were rounded to the nearest hundred. Metal contents are presented in ounces and pounds. Any discrepancies in the totals are due to rounding effects; rounding followed the recommendations in NI 43-101.\n-\nThe qualified person is not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title-related, taxation, socio-political, marketing or other relevant issue that could materially affect the mineral resource estimate\nAbout the Detour\u2013Fenelon Gold Trend Property\nWallbridge\u2019s land position on the Detour-Fenelon Gold Trend comprises 97 km of contiguous properties stretching east from the Ontario border along the Sunday Lake Deformation Zone which hosts at least three gold systems including Canada\u2019s second largest producing gold mine - Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd.\u2019s Detour Lake open pit.

FLI by their nature are based on assumptions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such FLI. Although the FLI contained in this press release is based upon what management believes, or believed at the time, to be reasonable assumptions, the Company cannot assure shareholders and prospective purchasers of securities of the Company that actual results will be consistent with such FLI, as there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended, and neither the Company nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of any such FLI. Except as required by law, the Company does not undertake, and assumes no obligation, to update or revise any such FLI contained herein to reflect new events or circumstances, except as may be required by law. Unless otherwise noted, this press release has been prepared based on information available as of November 9, 2021. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on the FLI or information contained herein. Furthermore, should one or more of the risks, uncertainties or other factors materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described in FLI.\nAssumptions upon which FLI is based, without limitation, include: the ability of exploration activities to accurately predict mineralization; the accuracy of geological modelling; the ability of the Company to complete further exploration activities; the legitimacy of title and property interests in the Deposits; the accuracy of key assumptions, parameters or methods used to estimate the MREs; the ability of the Company to obtain required approvals; the results of exploration activities; the evolution of the global economic climate; metal prices; environmental expectations; community and non-governmental actions; and any impacts of COVID-19 on the Deposits, the Company\u2019s financial position, the Company\u2019s ability to secure required funding, or operations. Risks and uncertainties about Wallbridge's business are more fully discussed in the disclosure materials filed with the securities regulatory authorities in Canada, which are available at www.sedar.com.\nCovid\u201219 \u2012 Given the rapidly evolving nature of the Coronavirus (COVID\u201219) pandemic, Wallbridge is actively monitoring the situation in order to continue to maintain as best as possible the activities while striving to protect the health of its personnel. Wallbridge' activities will continue to align with the guidance provided by local, provincial and federal authorities in Canada. The Company has established measures to continue normal activities while protecting the health of its employees and stakeholders. Depending on the evolution of the virus, measures may affect the regular operations of Wallbridge and the participation of staff members in events inside or outside Canada.\nInformation Concerning Estimates of Mineral Resources\nThe disclosure in this press release and referred to herein was prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 which differs significantly from the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"). The terms \"measured mineral resource\", \"indicated mineral resource\" and \"inferred mineral resource\" used in this press release are in reference to the mining terms defined in the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Standards (the \"CIM Definition Standards\"), which definitions have been adopted by NI 43-101. Accordingly, information contained in this press release providing descriptions of our mineral deposits in accordance with NI 43-101 may not be comparable to similar information made public by other U.S. companies subject to the United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nInvestors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral resources will ever be converted into reserves. Pursuant to CIM Definition Standards, \"inferred mineral resources\" are that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. Such geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade or quality continuity. An inferred mineral resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to an indicated mineral resource and must not be converted to a mineral reserve. However, it is reasonably expected that the majority of inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to indicated mineral resources with continued exploration. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource is economically or legally mineable. Disclosure of \"contained ounces\" in a resource is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute \"reserves\" by SEC standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures.\nCanadian standards, including the CIM Definition Standards and NI 43-101, differ significantly from standards in the SEC Industry Guide 7. Effective February 25, 2019, the SEC adopted new mining disclosure rules under subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"SEC Modernization Rules\"), with compliance required for the first fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2021. The SEC Modernization Rules replace the historical property disclosure requirements included in SEC Industry Guide 7. As a result of the adoption of the SEC Modernization Rules, the SEC now recognizes estimates of \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources\". Information regarding mineral resources contained or referenced in this press release may not be comparable to similar information made public by companies that report according to U.S. standards. While the SEC Modernization Rules are purported to be \"substantially similar\" to the CIM Definition Standards, readers are cautioned that there are differences between the SEC Modernization Rules and the CIM Definitions Standards. Accordingly, there is no assurance any mineral resources that the Company may report as \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources\" under NI 43-101 would be the same had the Company prepared the resource estimates under the standards adopted under the SEC Modernization Rules.",

In addition, trenching and reconnaissance programs are underway to assist with the identification of drill targets for the next phase of exploration drill programs to be undertaken following the Resource Update planned for Q3 2021.\u201d\nAdyton also advises that the second diamond drilling rig previously located at Gameta has arrived at the Feni Island project. There are now two diamond drill rigs in place at Feni Island with drilling anticipated to commence shortly.\nSummary Geological Setting: The mineralisation model developed for Wapolu is that the gold is associated with hydrothermal fluids, concentrated in shallow-dipping deposits within or immediately adjacent to a detachment fault zone (DFZ) developed along a contact between a domed metamorphic basement and an overlying ultramafic unit. This is the same model as for Gameta, the sister deposit located 30kms away (the subject of Adyton\u2019s recent drilling programs). This general setting is analogous to such deposits as Misima in PNG and Mesquite and Picacho in California. The gold occurs in association with fine sulphides as disseminations and in epithermal quartz veins in lensoid zones parallel to the DFZ.\nSummary of Previous Work: Exploration commenced in the early 1980\u2019s with geological mapping, stream sediment sampling, rock chip and float sampling, geophysics and a small diamond drill program. By the mid-1980\u2019s this had expanded to trenching, airborne surveys and more drilling resulting in the discovery of the Wapolu deposit. A small trial mine was conducted in the mid 1990\u2019s, and in the early 2000\u2019s a limited metallurgical test-work program and technical study were carried out. Since that time very little activity has been carried out.\nThe Wapolu Gold deposit currently consists of 3.1 million tonnes at an average grade of 1.42 g/t Au, for contained gold of 140,000 Inferred Resources ounces, assuming a cut-off grade of 0.8 g/t Au.1\nDrill Program Overview:\nThe initial diamond drilling program at the Wapolu Project is designed to provide detailed information on the mineralised zones by diamond coring in two selected areas and so obtaining samples for metallurgical testing and to confirm previous historical intersections. A limited coring program is proposed in this initial phase of 400 \u2013 500m.\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this press release.\n(1) Notes Regarding Inferred Mineral Resource Estimates\nThe Fergusson Island Project currently has a mineral resource prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\u201cNI 43-101\u201d) dated December 17, 2020, which has outlined an initial inferred mineral resource of: (i) at Gameta, 7.2 million tonnes at an average grade of 1.55 g/t Au, for contained gold of 360,000 ounces, assuming a cut-off grade of 0.8 g/t Au; and (ii) at Wapolu, 3.1 million tonnes at an average grade of 1.42 g/t Au, for contained gold of 140,000 ounces, assuming a cut-off grade of 0.8 g/t Au.\nSee the NI 43-101 technical report entitled \u201cNI 43-101 Technical Report on the Fergusson Gold Property, Milne Bay Province, Papua New Guinea\u201d (the \u201cFergusson Island Technical Report\u201d) dated February 1, 2021 and prepared for XIB by Mark Berry (MAIG), Simon Tear (MIGI PGeo), Matthew White (MAIG) and Ian Ryan Roy (MAIG), each an independent mining consultant and \u201cqualified person\u201d as defined in NI 43-101, available under Adyton\u2019s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.\nQualified Person\nThe scientific and technical information contained in this press release has been prepared, reviewed, and approved by Rod Watt, BSc Hons (Geo), FAusIMM, Chief Geologist and a director of Adyton, who is a \"Qualified Person\" as defined by National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\").

The drilling program confirmed the Obuom Mine trend as the most promising target at Dankran, intercepting multiple generally narrow zones of mineralization with indications of higher-grade potential in one hole and width potential in another hole.\nHighlights of the Dankran RC Drilling Program:\n2,491 meters of RC drilling in 36 holes completed on 6 drill fences,\nTen holes returned significant results (at a cut-off of 0.40 g/t Au) with grades up to 6.07 g/t Au over 2.0 meters and mineralized widths up 0.47 g/t Au over 10.0 meters, along a strike length of 2.5 kilometers,\nSeveral significant Au-in-soil anomalies remain to be tested, however future work will principally focus on the extension of the Obuom Mine trend where this program returned significant intercepts.\nIngrid Hibbard, President and CEO commented, \"We are pleased to complete our maiden exploration RC drill test of targets on our Dankran property and receive a number of noteworthy drill intercepts. The results provide encouragement to conducting further work at Dankran. Our focus will now switch over to our Manfo Project where a sizeable drilling program is planned, after which we will consider further work programs to be planned for Dankran.\"\nDetails of the Dankran RC Drilling Program\nThe Dankran property is a 34.65 square kilometer (\"km\u00b2\") Prospecting License optioned by Pelangio Exploration from BNT Resources Ghana Ltd. in November 2020 and is contiguous to the northeastern corner of Pelangio's Obuasi project. The Dankran property is adjacent to and on strike with the historic Obuom Mine which produced 29,000 ounces of gold at an average grade of 16 g/t Au from underground workings in the 1930's. The property covers nearly seven km of strike of highly prospective geology and regional structures along the western flank of the Ashanti Belt, which hosts AngloGold Ashanti's giant Obuasi Mine 20 km to the southwest. Pelangio conducted several programs of soil sampling on Dankran between December 2020 and March 2021 identifying multiple gold-in-soil anomalies worthy of drill testing. In addition, prospecting and geological mapping, which identified a number of artisanal workings and hand-dug shafts, traced the Obuom mineralized structure to the northeastern boundary of the Dankran property.\nA maiden RC drilling program was conducted during May and June 2021 to test the most favourable soil anomalism and the strike extension of the Obuom structure in the northeastern end of Dankran. A total of 2,491 meters of RC drilling in 36 holes along 6 fences of drilling was completed. Sampling was conducted at 1-meter drill intervals and composited into 2-meters samples for Au fire-assay. Ten of the holes drilled returned generally narrow gold intercepts with one hole illustrating potential for high grades (DKRC014: 6.07 g/t Au over 2.0 meters) and one hole demonstrating potential for broader widths of mineralization (DKRC020: 0.47 g/t Au over 10.0 meters). Gold mineralization is associated with quartz veining focused along narrow shears at geological contacts, along and near to the main metasedimentary-metavolcanic contact on which the Obuom mine sits. The drilling has illustrated multiple, generally narrow, zones of mineralization along and near this regional contact over a strike length of 2.5 kilometers. The one-meter samples from the significant (> 0.40 g/t Au cut-off) 2-meter composited intercepts reported have been pulled for assay to better define the widths and grades present. Refer to Table 1 and Figures 1 and 2.\nIn addition to the maiden RC drilling test at Dankran, further infill soil sampling was completed in March to better define several Au-in-soil anomalies in the south to southwest areas of the Dankran property with a further 142 soil samples collected. The soil sampling did not add significantly to the soil anomalism but refined several anomalies for possible drill testing. Refer to Figure 1.\nFuture Plans for Dankran\nThe Dankran RC drilling program was successful in demonstrating multiple zones of mineralization along 2.5 kilometers of strike and highlighted the regional metasedimentary-metavolcanic contact on which the Obuom Mine sits as being the principal target. Although several significant untested Au-soil-anomalies remain which may be drill tested in future programs, the Obuom Mine trend in the northeastern part of the Dankran property will be the focus of any future work. Future plans may include additional mapping and prospecting plus possible limited ground geophysics and trenching to improve targeting, possibly followed by another small program of RC drill testing plus limited core drilling to better understand the geology and structural controls of the mineralization identified in the maiden RC drill program as well as to investigate the mineralization potential at depth.\nThe Company is now preparing to move to its Manfo Project on the Sefwi gold belt in Ghana, for a Fall 2021 drill program. Approximately 10,000 meters of combined exploration air-core plus resource extension diamond drilling is planned for the Manfo Project.\nTable 1.

All holes were drilled at an azimuth of 140\u00b0 and a dip of -50\u00b0. Drill holes were planned for 80 meters depth each, however if wet drilling conditions were encountered the drill hole was stopped to avoid potential grade smearing. Drill holes were nominally spaced at 50 meters apart on each drill fence, however where drill holes were shorter than 80 meters the spacing was shortened to allow for adequate heel-to-toe drill coverage. Holes were positioned with a hand-held GPS (accuracy +/- 5 meters) but have not been surveyed in more accurately. Sampling was conducted from the drill rig cyclone at 1 meter drill intervals. Each 1-meter sample was riffle split to approximately 2 kilograms and subsequently combined into 2-meter composite samples for assay. The 1-meter samples were retained in a secure location for follow up assaying if required. Samples were analyzed by 50g Fire Assay at the Intertek Minerals Limited laboratory in Tarkwa Ghana. QA/QC samples, including certified standards, blanks and duplicate samples, were inserted into the RC drill sample stream at a rate of one in eight samples. The QA/QC results were within acceptable limits. The laboratory also performed their own internal QA/QC checks, which were also acceptable. The true thicknesses of the mineralized drill intercepts are unknown at this time given the limited structural information to date.\nMethodology and QA/QC details for the final phase of infill soil sampling completed at Dankran in March are the same as reported in Pelangio's January 28, 2021, news release on Dankran soil sampling results.\nDirector Resignation\nFurther, the Company regrets to announce that Dr. Joyce Aryee has resigned from Pelangio's Board of Directors effective immediately, as a result of other board commitments in the same jurisdiction, which could potentially represent a perceived conflict regarding Pelangio's Ghanaian exploration projects. The Company thanks her for her service.\nQualified Person\nMr. Kevin Thomson, P.Geo. (Ontario), is a qualified person within the meaning of National Instrument 43-101. Mr. Thomson approved the technical data disclosed in this release.\nAbout Pelangio\nPelangio acquires and explores world-class land packages on prolific gold belts in Ghana, West Africa and in Canada.

The shiny metal tends to hold up well during stock market crashes and periods of high inflation.\nParrilla believes both could happen in the near future, as people are not appreciating the risks of the massive pandemic stimulus efforts underway, like today's incredibly low interest rates. He expects the next decade will see runaway inflation that central banks cannot control.\n\u201cCentral bank money printing isn\u2019t really solving problems, it\u2019s delaying the problem,\u201d Parrilla says. \u201cGold will benefit purely from being a physical asset that you cannot print.\u201d\nHow to make money with gold\nIf Parrilla's argument is making sense, or you've got your own reasons for investing in gold, you have a few options available to you.\nYou can either buy physical gold like bars or gold coins, invest in gold mining company stocks or a gold exchange-traded fund (ETF) or buy into gold futures.\n1. Buy gold bullion or coins\nThe most straightforward way to put your money in gold is to buy and store gold bars, coins or jewelry.\nTo actually make a profit off the precious metal, you need to have a reasonable expectation that your gold can be sold for more than you paid for it. Unfortunately, gold prices are notoriously difficult to predict.\nIn the 1990s, gold barely hit $300 on a good day. Then, as financial and political crises loomed in the mid-2000s, people did what they always do and started buying up gold, which drove up gold prices.\nIts value more than doubled from $800 an ounce in 2009 to $1,900 in 2011. But by 2013, the bubble had burst and gold was down to $1,300.\nIf gold forms part of your retirement plan, you can actually buy it through a gold Individual Retirement Account (IRA). That said, you\u2019ll need to set it up with a special custodian or broker, and you may face unpleasant fees to cover the cost of storing the metal.\n2. Invest in gold stocks\nYou can invest in gold without ever touching a flake of it by purchasing shares of gold mining companies on the stock market.\nThe advantage is that if the price of gold suddenly plummets, you may not lose your shirt because the mining company could decide to focus on another metal.\nThe disadvantage of owning mining stocks is that they can decline with the rest of the market, even when the value of gold is steady. In fact, business factors can always come into play \u2014 factors like the company\u2019s financials, the quality of its management team and long-term production prospects.\nYou can easily invest in commodity stocks through any number of investing apps \u2014 although a few will give you a free stock just for signing up.\n3. Put money into gold ETFs\nInvestors might buy into gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to avoid the uncertainty that comes with investing in a particular company.\nPut simply, these funds are pools of money from investors that are poured into a variety of gold and mining companies. ETFs are traded like stocks; some of the most popular gold ETFs are GLD, GDX and GDXJ.\nYou will have to be prepared to lose a certain percentage of your investment\u2019s value every year to the fund\u2019s expense ratio. For example, with the largest gold ETF, SPDR Gold Shares, you\u2019ll be charged 0.40% of your investment\u2019s value each year.\nStill, ETFs as a whole have very low management fees, and you save even more by buying them through a zero-commission investing app.\nIt\u2019s also important to note that there's still a measure of uncertainty when investing in ETFs. Although these funds are heavily diversified to reduce risk, they are subject to the fluctuations of the stock market.\nIf the market crashes, the value of your investment could drop even if the value of gold doesn\u2019t change.\n4. Buy gold futures\nGold futures are very complicated. They're contracts in which you agree to buy a set amount of gold at a specific price some time in the future.\nTraders can strategically buy and sell futures contracts to profit from the changing price of gold.\nBuyers of futures contracts profit when commodity prices rise. Sellers of futures contracts profit when commodity prices fall.\nThe contracts typically require a minimum purchase of 100 ounces of gold. Novice investors should exercise extreme caution with futures contracts due to the high degree of borrowing typically involved.\nNext steps: Buying gold as an investment\nBefore you go King Midas and turn your entire portfolio to gold, take the following precautionary steps:\nDecide your risk tolerance: Investing in gold futures can be risky, while ETFs can help spread out your risk.\nDo your research: If you decide to invest in a specific gold mining company, look into its performance over the last few years and whether it mines for other metals or resources.\nStart slow: Most people who invest in gold make it a small part of a diversified portfolio. Consider a wide range of investments, including things like real estate and even farmland.\nAsk for help: Don\u2019t be shy to ask your financial adviser for their input on whether gold would be a good addition.\nAnd remember, if you're just starting out as an investor, it's not a bad idea to look into some low-stakes alternatives.

(\u201cKirkland Lake Gold\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSX:KL) (NYSE:KL) (ASX:KLA) today announced the filing of a technical report (the \u201c 2021 Detour Lake Technical Report\u201d or the \u201cReport\u201d) for the Company\u2019s Detour Lake Mine, entitled \u201cDetour Lake Operation, Ontario, Canada, NI 43-101 Technical Report.\u201d The Report was prepared in compliance with National Instrument 43-101 \u2013 Standards for Disclosure of Mineral Projects (\u201cNI 43-101\u201d) and is effective as at December 31, 2020. The Report is available under Kirkland Lake Gold\u2019s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and on the Company\u2019s website at www.kl.gold. All dollar amounts in this press release are expressed in US dollars, unless otherwise indicated.\nThe 2021 Detour Lake Technical Report includes a new life-of-mine plan (\u201c2021 LOMP\u201d) that supports the scientific and technical disclosure in the updated Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates as at December 31, 2020 contained in the Company\u2019s press release dated February 25, 2021. In addition, results published in the Report are consistent with, and confirm, the multi-year production guidance (2021 \u2013 2023) and unit cost and capital expenditure guidance for 2021 included in the Company\u2019s press release dated December 10, 2020. The Report does not include any of the exploration success achieved since the Company acquired Detour Lake Mine on January 31, 2020; nor does it include the full impact of business improvement initiatives undertaken since the acquisition. The results of the Company\u2019s exploration program will be included in a new mine plan to be issued in 2022 (\u201c2022 LOMP\u201d), which the Company expects will lead to significant value enhancement opportunities for the Detour Lake operation.\nUnder the 2021 LOMP, production is expected to average 680,000 \u2013 720,000 ounces from 2021 \u2013 2024, before increasing to 800,000 ounces in 2025. Production would then decline for three years during a period of increased stripping before reaching over 900,000 ounces beginning in 2032. As the Company continues its exploration drilling and works to factor the significant drilling success it is achieving into the 2022 LOMP, an important objective will be to achieve growth in reserves and changes to the production profile such that there is not a drop off in production after 2025, and to achieve 900,000 ounces of production, or higher, as early in the mine life as possible, leading to further improvements in unit costs and free cash flow.\nThe Detour Lake Technical Report was prepared by following Kirkland Lake Gold employees, all of whom are qualified persons as defined in NI 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mining Projects and in compliance with Form 43-101F1: Mr. Andre Leite, P.Eng, Detour Lake Mine Technical Service Manager; Mr. Jean Francois Dupont, P.Eng, Detour Lake Chief Metallurgist; Dr. Veronika Raizman, P.Geo., Manager, Reclamation & Geochemistry; and Mr. Paul Andrew Fournier, P.Eng, Manager, Cost Accounting.\n2021 Detour Lake Technical Report and LOMP\nAmong the key results included in the 2021 Detour Lake Technical Report and LOMP are the following:\n-\nSignificant production growth in first five years compared to previous results driven by a lower strip ratio and expanded levels of mill throughput, with production targeted at 680,000 \u2013 720,000 ounces from 2021 \u2013 2024 and reaching 800,000 ounces in 2025\n-\nLow unit costs in the first five years (2021 \u2013 2025) with operating cash costs per ounce sold(1)(2) averaging US$524 and all-in sustaining costs (\u201cAISC\u201d) per ounce per ounce sold(1)(2) averaging $775\n-\nLong Production Life of 22 years based on 13.8 million ounces of Mineral Reserves (at or above a 0.50 g/t cut-off grade) and 2.0 million ounces of low-grade stockpile Mineral Reserves (below 0.50 g/t cut-off grade) to mainly be processed at the end of the mine life; potential exists for extended life with updated resource model incorporating 2020 and 2021 exploration drilling\n-\nCapital expenditures that support expanded production levels and a long mine life; sustaining capital expenditure estimates based on actual operating experience; growth capital expenditure estimates reflect the impact of multiple new growth projects aimed at maximizing after-tax cash flow over the life of mine and positioning Detour Lake to take advantage of additional growth opportunities once the results of exploration drilling are factored into the mine plan.\n(1) See \u201cNon-IFRS Measures\u201d in this press release and in the MD&A for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\n(2) Unit costs determined using a gold price of $1,500/oz and an exchange rate of CAD/USD of 1.31.\nTony Makuch, President and CEO of Kirkland Lake Gold, commented: \u201cThe 2021 LOMP represents an important interim report on our progress advancing the Detour Lake Mine, defining a highly profitable operation that is well positioned to benefit from our ongoing exploration success and other value creation opportunities. Based on the new mine plan, Detour Lake is poised to become Canada\u2019s largest gold producer and, with the potential for substantial growth in Mineral Reserves as our drilling programs continue, could very well become one of the largest and most profitable gold mines in the world.\n\u201cThe 2021 LOMP includes significant production growth and improved unit costs compared to past operating experience. Production growth is driven by higher levels of mill throughput, reflecting increased ore tonnes mined, lower stripping ratios, better ore fragmentation and improved productivity in the mill based on a number of key business improvement initiatives. Sustaining capital estimates, which account for about half of total capital expenditures in the first five years, are based on actual experience over the last several years and extensive engineering work. Growth capital expenditures over this period mainly relate to new growth projects aimed at maximizing returns and positioning the operation to benefit fully from additional value creation opportunities.\n\u201cA key factor driving our interest in acquiring Detour Lake Mine was the belief that we could substantially grow Mineral Reserves through extensive drilling. Results to date support our view that there is a large, continuous corridor of mineralization along the Detour Mine Trend that extends from the Main Pit, through the Saddle Zone and continues beyond the West Pit location. With continued drilling success, we anticipate transitioning to a much larger pit design as we grow our Mineral Reserve base leading to further increases in production at better unit costs.\u201d\nKey Assumptions\nThe Economic analysis of the operation was completed using a gold price of US$1,500 per ounce and a CAD$/US$ exchange rate of 1.31. The current gold price provided for Mineral Reserve estimation is US$1,300/oz, with US$ 1,500/oz being used for Mineral Resource estimation. Both Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates use an exchange rate assumption of CAD/US $1.31. The project start date is January 1, 2021 with mining conducted over a period of 18 years and processing activities extending over 22 years, with the final three years of processing reflecting the milling previously stockpiled low-grade Mineral Reserves.\nReview of Operations\nDuring the Life of Mine (\u201cLOM\u201d), a total of 14,499,000 ounces of gold is produced at an average grade of 0.82 g/t and an average recovery rate of 91.9%. The production profile assumes the mining of 593.9 million tonnes of ore with an average strip ratio of 1.90 and an ex-pit ore grade of 0.82 g/t over a period of 18 years, including 1,954,000 ounces of low-grade stockpiled Mineral Reserves, which will mainly be processed over a four year period at the end of the mine life. Over the first five years of operation, starting at January 1, 2021, 3,618,000 ounces of gold are produced in aggregate (an average of 723,600 ounces per year) from processing 132.8 million tonnes at an average grade of 0.92 g/t and at an average recovery rate of 92.0%. A total of 186.4 million tonnes of ore is projected to be mined during this five-year period at an average grade of 0.78 g/t and at an average strip ratio of 2.08.\nOn a per ounce sold basis, average unit costs over the LOM are expected to include operating cash costs per ounce sold of $619 and AISC per ounce sold of $821. Unit costs in the first five years of the operation are expected to be better than the LOM averages and clearly establish Detour Lake Mine as a low-cost gold mining operation with operating cash costs of $524 and AISC per ounce sold of $775.\nTable 1.

The currency used to calculate cash flow in the 2021 Detour Lake Technical Report is the Canadian dollar. For the purpose of this press release, amounts have been converted to US dollars using an exchange rate of CAD/US 1.31. Operating costs were prepared based on recent operating history and technical assumptions associated with the production profile. Capital expenditures were prepared based on engineering estimates, vendor quotes, maintenance strategies, or estimated long-term requirements based on current asset value. The economic evaluation assumes the continued payment of a 2% net smelter royalty to Franco-Nevada Corporation and the continuation of existing payment obligations to First Nations groups.\nAs outlined in Table 2 below, the pre-tax cumulative cash flow is estimated at $8,505 million. The post-tax cumulative cash flow is estimated at $6,377 million. At a 5% discount rate, the Net Present Value of pre-tax cash flows is $5,049 million and of post-tax cash flows is $3,792 million.\nOver the first five years of the project total pre-tax cumulative cash flow is estimated at $1,602 million, for an average of $320.3 million per year. The post-tax cumulative cash flow is estimated at $1,299 million over the five-year period.\nTable 2.

Contributing to the level of capex in the first five years are a number of key projects, including $65 \u2013 $75 million for projects aimed at increasing throughput in the mill to 28 million tonnes per year. Capital expenditures for mining includes equipment replacement, planned component replacements, and capitalized maintenance of 795 haul trucks. Expenditures related to the tailings management areas (\u201cTMA\u201d) include construction of Cell 2 and Cell 3, while G&A costs are largely related to environmental permitting for the West Detour project and the Mine Water Pond.\nFigure 7. Capital Expenditures (2021 \u2013 2025) is available at: https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/04a3a6c5-368c-411d-8ec0-8cf8f5355bc2\nMineral Reserves and Mineral Resources\nMineral Reserve estimates included in the 2021 Detour Lake Technical Report and LOMP are as at December 31, 2020 and were previously reported in a press release dated February 25, 2021. Mineral Reserves at Detour Lake as at December 31, 2020 were estimated at 13,821,000 ounces at an average grade of 0.96 g/t at an average cut-off grade at or above 0.50 g/t. In addition, the Company also established low-grade Mineral Reserves of 1,954,000 ounces at an average grade of 0.41 g/t. These Mineral Reserves will mainly be processed at the end of the mine life and, under previous mine planning, would have been mined as waste. Measured and Indicated (\u201cM&I\u201d) Mineral Resources as at December 31, 2020 were estimated at 5,191,000 ounces at an average grade of 1.21 g/t. Inferred Mineral Resources totaled 1,606,000 ounces at an average grade of 0-.94 g/t.\nTable 3.

The estimate is reported above a cut-off grade of 2.2 g/t Au.\n-\nEstimates have been rounded in accordance with reporting guidelines. Totals may not sum due to rounding.\nNon-IFRS Measures\nThe Company has included certain non-IFRS measures in this document, as discussed below. The Company believes that these measures, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, provide investors an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the Company. The non-IFRS measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. These measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS, and therefore may not be comparable to other issuers.\nFree Cash Flow\nIn the gold mining industry, free cash flow is a common performance measure with no standardized meaning. The Company calculates free cash flow by deducting cash capital spending (capital expenditures for the period, net of expenditures paid through finance leases) from net cash provided by operating activities. The Company discloses free cash flow as it believes the measure provides valuable assistance to investors and analysts in evaluating the Company\u2019s ability to generate cash flow after capital investments and build the cash resources of the Company.\nOperating Cash Costs and Operating Cash Costs per Ounce Sold\nOperating cash costs and operating cash cost per tonne and per ounce sold are non-IFRS measures. In the gold mining industry, these metrics are common performance measures but do not have any standardized meaning under IFRS. Operating cash costs include mine site operating costs such as mining, processing and administration, but exclude royalty expenses, depreciation and depletion and share based payment expenses and reclamation costs. Operating cash cost per ounce sold is based on ounces sold and is calculated by dividing operating cash costs by volume of gold ounces sold.\nThe Company discloses operating cash costs and operating cash cost per tonne and per ounce as it believes the measures provide valuable assistance to investors and analysts in evaluating the Company\u2019s operational performance and ability to generate cash flow. The most directly comparable measure prepared in accordance with IFRS is total production expenses. Operating cash costs and operating cash cost per ounce of gold should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS.\nSustaining and Growth Capital\nSustaining capital and growth capital are Non-IFRS measures. Sustaining capital is defined as capital required to maintain current operations at existing levels. Growth capital is defined as capital expenditures for major growth projects or enhancement capital for significant infrastructure improvements at existing operations. Both measurements are used by management to assess the effectiveness of investment programs.\nAISC and AISC per Ounce Sold\nAISC and AISC per ounce are Non-IFRS measures. These measures are intended to assist readers in evaluating the total costs of producing gold from current operations. While there is no standardized meaning across the industry for this measure, the Company\u2019s definition conforms to the definition of AISC as set out by the World Gold Council in its guidance note dated June 27, 2013. The Company defines AISC as the sum of operating costs (as defined and calculated above), royalty expenses, sustaining capital, corporate expenses and reclamation cost accretion related to current operations. Corporate expenses include general and administrative expenses, net of transaction related costs, severance expenses for management changes and interest income. AISC excludes growth capital expenditures, growth exploration expenditures, reclamation cost accretion not related to current operations, interest expense, debt repayment and taxes.\nAverage Realized Price per Ounce Sold\nIn the gold mining industry, average realized price per ounce sold is a common performance measure that does not have any standardized meaning. The most directly comparable measure prepared in accordance with IFRS is revenue from gold sales. Average realized price per ounce sold should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. The measure is intended to assist readers in evaluating the total revenues realized in a period from current operations.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nThe exploration, development and mining of mineral deposits involves significant risks, which even a combination of careful evaluation, experience and knowledge may not eliminate. Kirkland Lake Gold is subject to several financial and operational risks that could have a significant impact on its cash flows and profitability. The most significant risks and uncertainties faced by the Company include: the price of gold; the uncertainty of production estimates (which assume accuracy of projected grade, recovery rates, and tonnage estimates and may be impacted by unscheduled maintenance, labour and other operating, engineering or technical difficulties with respect to the development of its projects, many of which may not be within the control of the Company), including the ability to extract anticipated tonnes and successfully realizing estimated grades; the threat of outbreaks of viruses or other infectious disease, including COVID-19; changes to operating and capital cost assumptions; the inherent risk associated with project development and permitting processes; the uncertainty of the mineral resources and their development into mineral reserves; the replacement of depleted reserves; foreign exchange risks; changes in applicable laws and regulations (including tax legislation); reclamation obligations; regulatory; tax matters and foreign mining tax regimes, as well as health, safety, environmental and cybersecurity risks.

Measured and indicated resources are sufficiently well defined to allow geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed and permit the application of technical and economic parameters in assessing the economic viability of the resource. Inferred resources are estimated on limited information not sufficient to verify geological and grade continuity or to allow technical and economic parameters to be applied. Inferred resources are too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them to enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. There is no certainty that Measured or Indicated mineral resources can be upgraded to mineral reserves through continued exploration and positive economic assessment.\nInformation Concerning Estimates Of Mineral Reserves And Measured, Indicated And Inferred Resources\nThis press release has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the securities laws in effect in Canada, which differ in certain material respects from the disclosure requirements of United States securities laws. The terms \u201cmineral reserve\u201d, \u201cproven mineral reserve\u201d and \u201cprobable mineral reserve\u201d are Canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 \u2013 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\u201cNI 43-101\u201d) and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the \u201cCIM\u201d) \u2013 CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council, as amended (the \u201cCIM Standards\u201d). These definitions differ significantly from the definitions in the disclosure requirements promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) applicable to domestic reporting companies.

(\u201cK92\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSX: KNT; OTCQX: KNTNF) is pleased to announce results from the ongoing diamond drilling of the Kora deposit at the Kainantu gold mine in Papua New Guinea.\nThe results for the latest 43 diamond drill holes completed from underground into the Kora deposit are summarized in Table 1 below. The results continue to demonstrate the high-grade and continuity of Kora, with intersections largely focused on increasing drill density up-dip, down-dip and to the south to upgrade resources for the Stage 3 Expansion Feasibility Study. Results also include some step out drilling to the south outside of the existing resource envelope. From the drilling results, all drill holes intersected mineralization, with 9 intersections exceeding 20 g/t AuEq, 20 intersections exceeding 10 g/t AuEq and 45 intersections exceeding 5 g/t AuEq.\nDrilling to the south has continued to record high-grade intersections, expanding high-grade areas and the extents of known mineralization. Highlights include: KMDD0339 recording multiple intersections including 6.30 m at 24.86 g/t Au, 74 g/t Ag and 4.44% Cu (32.11 g/t AuEq, 5.33 m true width) from the K2 Vein and, approximately 25 m up-dip, KMDD0337 recording multiple intersections including 7.20 m at 16.05 g/t Au, 92 g/t Ag and 3.28% Cu (21.89 g/t AuEq, 6.92 m true width) from the K2 Vein.\nStepping out further to the South and beyond the current resource, KMDD0343 intersected 17.40 m at 5.93 g/t Au, 75 g/t Ag and 2.33% Cu (10.20 g/t AuEq, 6.11 m true width) at the K2 Vein and KMDD0385 intersected 3.50 m at 0.60 g/t Au, 50 g/t Ag and 7.91% Cu (12.44 g/t AuEq, 2.40 m true width) at the K2 Vein.\nOther high-grade intersections include: KMDD0292 recording multiple intersections including 5.35 m at 37.56 g/t Au, 4 g/t Ag and 0.26% Cu (37.98 g/t AuEq, 4.18 m true width) from the K1 Vein, and approximately 25m up-dip and towards the south, KMDD0296 recording multiple intersections including 8.93 m at 22.75 g/t Au, 4 g/t Ag and 0.17% Cu (23.04 g/t AuEq, 7.33 m true width) from the K1 Vein, plus approximately 75m down-dip and towards the north, KMDD0286 recording multiple intersections including 3.00 m at 71.22 g/t Au, 14 g/t Ag and 0.17% Cu (71.64 g/t AuEq, 1.38 m true width) from the K1 Vein. The drilling results are part of a cluster of several holes including KMDD0286, KMDD0292, KMDD0296, KMDD0288, KMDD0294, KMDD0306 that expanded a high-grade zone to depth.\nLong sections of K1 and K2 showing the location of the latest drill holes are provided in figures 1 and 2, respectively. A long section showing Kora drilling to date is provided in figure 3. A core photograph of drill hole KMDD0296 is provided in figure 4.\nJohn Lewins, K92 Chief Executive Officer and Director, stated, \u201cThe ongoing drilling at Kora continues to deliver excellent results, in a combination of strong continuity, thickness and high grades with all 43 holes intersecting mineralization, 20% of holes intersecting above 20 g/t AuEq, 40% intersecting over 10 g/t AuEq and almost 85% intersecting above 4 g/t AuEq. These intersections recorded a solid thickness, averaging 2.64 metres and 3.94 metres true thickness for the K1 and K2 Veins, respectively. Notably, drilling at Kora continues to expand multiple high-grade areas with drill highlights including KMDD0286 recording 3.00 m at 71.64 g/t AuEq at the K1 Vein, KMDD0292 recording 5.35 m at 37.98 g/t AuEq at the K1 Vein, KMDD0296 recording 8.93 m at 23.04 g/t AuEq at the K1 Vein and KMDD0341 recording 2.40 m at 30.04 g/t AuEq at the K2 Vein. Results from step-out drilling outside of the mineral resource continue to deliver solid results as well, demonstrating that the system remains open and strong in multiple directions.\nWe are very excited about the second half of the year for exploration. The pace of results coming in has significantly increased as we concurrently work through our inventory of holes to core log and assay plus receive results from our ongoing drilling. With drilling currently underway at Kora, Judd and Blue Lake more updates are expected near-term.\u201d\nTable 1 - Kainantu Gold Mine \u2013 Significant Intercepts from Diamond Drilling\n| Hole_id |

Resource Estimate is included in a technical report titled, \u201cRevised Independent Technical Report, Mineral Resource Estimate Update and Preliminary Economic Assessment for Expansion of the Kainantu Mine to Treat 1 Mtpa from the Kora Gold Deposit, Kainantu Project, Papua New Guinea\u201d with an effective date of April 2, 2020.\n-\nThe Independent and Qualified Person responsible for the Mineral Resource Estimate is Simon Tear, P.Geo. of H & S Consultants Pty. Ltd., Sydney, Australia.\n-\nMineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.\n-\nResources were compiled at 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and 10 g/t gold cut-off grades.\n-\nDensity (t/m3) is on a per zone basis, K1 and Kora Link: 2.84 t/m3; K2: 2.93 t/m3; Waste: 2.8 t/m3.\n-\nReported tonnage and grade figures are rounded from raw estimates to reflect the order of accuracy of the estimate.\n-\nMinor variations may occur during the addition of rounded numbers.\n-\nCalculations used metric units (metres, tonnes and g/t)\n-\nGold equivalents are calculated as AuEq = Au g/t + ((0.923 x Cu%)*1.38)+ ((0.77 x Ag g/t*0.0115). Gold price US$1,400/oz; Silver US$16.05/oz; Copper US$3.05/lb. Metal payabilities and recoveries are incorporated into the AuEq formula. Recoveries of 92.3% for copper and 77% for silver.\nKey Assumptions and Parameters \u2013 Kora Deposit\nThe Kora Deposit comprises two parallel, steeply west dipping, north-south striking quartz-sulphide vein systems, K1 and K2, within an encompassing dilatant structural zone hosted by phyllite. An additional structure, the Kora Link, has also been defined between K1 and K2. There are five Kora Link structures identified, of which three are included in the resource estimate.\nThe current resource estimate area covers an area of approximately 1,250 metres along strike by 1,050 to 1,150 metres vertically representing ~75% of the drill target area. K92 plans to continue to drill the area not yet drilled. The resource estimate includes results from 266 diamond drill holes in addition to face samples taken from horizontal development and from cut and fill faces along the K1 and K2 veins.\nUnderground drilling consists of diamond core for a range of core sizes depending on the length of hole and expected ground conditions. Sampling is sawn half core under geological control and generally ranges between 0.5 m to 1.0 m. Underground face sampling is completed for every fired round and is to industry standard. QAQC data indicated no significant issues with the sampling or the accuracy of the on-site analysis. Current core recovery of the mineral zone is +95%, with initial drilling around the 90% mark.\nGeological logging is consistent and is based on a full set of logging codes covering lithology, alteration, and mineralization.\nThe geological interpretation of the vein systems is represented as 3D wireframe solids snapped to a combination of diamond drillhole data and underground face sampling. Definition of the wireframes is based on identified gold mineralization in drill core nominally at a 0.1-0.2g/t Au gold-off in conjunction with geological control/sense and current mining widths.\nThe wireframes were used to extract 1-metre composites (minimum of 0.5m) from the drillhole and sampling database for gold, copper and silver. A gold top cut of 1,000 g/t was applied to K2 composites and a 150 g/t top cut for the Kora Link #2. No top cuts were applied to silver or copper. Variography was generally poor, as would likely be expected, although K1 indicated better along strike grade continuity.\nGrade interpolation of the composite data was completed using Ordinary Kriging with a block size of 1 m x 5 m x 5 m. A larger block size check model indicated no evidence of over-smoothing of gold grade with the smaller block size.\nDefault average density values have been applied to the different lodes. The defaults are based on limited core measurements using the Archimedes Method (weight in air/weight in water). Density (t/m3) is on a per zone basis, with K1 and Kora Link: 2.84 t/m3; K2: 2.93 t/m3; Waste: 2.8 t/m3.\nA three-pass search strategy was applied to the grade interpolation. Search ellipse parameters are listed below. Search ellipse orientations generally reflected the subtle changes in dip and strike of the vein systems, with up to 8 search domains used for each lode.\nDrill Hole Sampling Methodology, QA/QC and Qualified Person\nDiamond drill hole is first logged to determine the sampling intervals, which range from a minimum of 0.1 metres to generally 1 metre. The drill core is sawn half core cut along a reference line, with the remainder of the core returned to the core tray. Core samples are then placed in numbered calico and plastic bags, with a numbered sample ticket for dispatch to the assay laboratory. Samples are separately assayed for gold, copper and silver. K92\u2019s procedure includes the insertion standards, blanks and duplicates. Gold assays are by the fire assay method. Copper and silver assays are by three-acid-digestion method (nitric, perchloric & hydrochloric mix).\nK92 maintains an industry-standard analytical quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) and data verification program to monitor laboratory performance and ensure high quality assays. Results from this program confirm reliability of the assay results. All sampling and analytical work for the mine exploration program is performed by Intertek Testing Services (PNG) LTD, an independent accredited laboratory that is located on site. External check assays for QA/QC purposes are performed at SGS Australia Pty Ltd in Townsville, Queensland, Australia.\nThe analytical QA/QC program is currently overseen by Andrew Kohler, PGeo, Mine Geology Manager and Mine Exploration Manager for K92. Andrew Kohler, a qualified person under the meaning of Canadian National Instrument 43-101 \u2013 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, has reviewed and is responsible for the technical content of this news release.\nAbout K92\nK92 Mining Inc. is engaged in the production of gold, copper and silver from the Kora deposit at the Kainantu Gold Mine in the Eastern Highlands province of Papua New Guinea, as well as exploration and development of mineral deposits in the immediate vicinity of the mine.

The secondary focus of the program is to continue to drill test previously discovered high-grade gold structures within the South Zone, Central Zone, Scotland Zone, #42 Zone and Sandy Zone as well as other prospective showings located elsewhere on the Magino property. Argonaut plans to drill approximately 25,000 metres on these targets this year, is currently drilling with four diamond drill rigs and anticipates completing the program during the fourth quarter of 2021.\nPete Dougherty, President and CEO stated: \"The goal of our 2021 program is to tighten the drill spacing within the Elbow Zone to the point where we can evaluate the resource potential of this important structure. Due to the exploration team's success to date at discovering high-grade gold structures below and adjacent to the planned open pit, we have numerous highly prospective drill targets.\"\nThe South Zone follows the southern contact of the Webb Lake Stock (granodiorite rocks) and volcanic rocks (Figure 2). Drill holes MA21-070 (7.0m at 13.3 g/t Au and 8.0 m at 5.1 g/t Au) and MA21-071 (9.5m at 3.7 g/t Au) were designed to test the South Zone as follow up holes to previously reported intercepts MA20-057 (10.0m at 19.0 g/t Au) and MA12-424 (21.0 m at 11.0 g/t Au including 7.6m at 29.4 g/t Au). This zone contains two parallel vein systems within a structure that has an approximate true width of 25 metres that mimics the trend of a nearby aplite dyke, appears to transect eastward into the volcanic rock package for an apparent strike length of 1.5 km to the eastern property boundary. Drill holes MA20-057 and MA20-070 intersected the gold-bearing vein system down-plunge for an estimated apparent true width ranging between 3.4m to 4.8m. With only three holes completed at depth to define this zone, additional drilling perpendicular to the vein system is required to accurately define the width of the vein systems that comprise the South Zone.\nFigure 2 \u2013 Drill holes MA21-070 and MA21-071 in relation to high-grade gold intercepts in previously announced drill holes MA20-057 and MA12-424\nInfill definition drilling of the Elbow Zone continues to define numerous high grade gold zones within this steeply east plunging structure where oriented core and the collection of structural measurements on significant vein systems continues to test the continuity of gold mineralized veins that define this important zone. Close to 17,000 metres of drilling is still needed to complete the Phase 1 definition drilling program. Drilling within the Elbow Zone continues to intersect exciting gold values (MA21-063 of 8.0 m at 7.7 g/t Au; MA21-067 of 2.0 m at 17.7 g/t Au) as presented on Figure 3 below.\nFigure 3 \u2013 Long Section of Elbow Zone Showing Completed Drill Holes and Planned Drill Holes\nBrian Arkell, Vice President of Exploration commented: \"We are continuing to develop a better understanding on the structural controls on the high-grade mineralization at Magino and are now in the process of early-stage resource definition drilling on the Elbow Zone.

Mr. Arkell also reviewed the diamond drilling, sampling, and on-site sample preparation procedures at Magino.\nFor sample analysis, the Company utilizes a system of Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) that includes insertion and verification of standards, blanks, and duplicates consistent with industry standards.\nThe Company has implemented a QA/QC program to ensure sampling and analysis of all exploration work is conducted in accordance with the CIM Exploration Best Practices Guidelines. The entire drill hole is sampled and tagged by geologic personnel. Cores are then photographed and sawn in half by experienced geotechnicians, placed in numbered plastic bags, and gathered in rice bags which are sealed with tamper-proof security tags under the supervision of the project geologists. The other half of the core is retained for future assay verification and/or metallurgical testing. Other QA/QC procedures include the insertion of coarse blanks and Canadian Reference Standards for every tenth sample in the sample stream. Samples are bagged, sealed with numbered security tags and shipped to the Activation Laboratories facility, Thunder Bay, Ontario, for sample preparation and assaying. The laboratory has its own QA/QC protocols, running standards, blanks, and duplicate samples in each batch stream. Gold analysis is conducted by lead collection, fire assay with a gravimetric finish on a 50-gram sample. Metallic screen fire assaying is now completed using a 1.0 kg sample and two 50 gm fire assays of the pass (-100 mesh) pulverized material on all samples containing visible gold. Check assays are conducted at a secondary ISO certified laboratory.\nPlease see below under the heading \"Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements\" for further details regarding risks.\nCreating Value Beyond Gold\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements\nThis press release contains certain \"forward-looking statements\" and \"forward-looking information\" under applicable Canadian securities laws concerning the business, operations and financial performance and condition of Argonaut Gold Inc.

Inferred Mineral Resources total 2,620,000 tonnes at a grade of 9.53 grams per tonne gold, for 803,000 ounces of contained gold.\n\u201cThis early exploration success at Ormaque highlights the outstanding growth potential at Lamaque,\u201d said George Burns, President and CEO. \u201cThe short time frame from initial discovery to maiden inferred resource is a testament to the drive of our team and the strong exploration potential within our land package in the Abitibi Greenstone Belt. The strike continuity, vein orientation and dimensions of the Ormaque deposit exhibit important similarities to parts of the nearby historically mined Sigma deposit and Mine #2. It is ideally positioned along the ore haulage decline now under construction connecting the Lamaque-Triangle Mine with the Sigma Mill. Our focus in 2021 is on in-fill and expansion drilling as the deposit remains open in multiple directions. We are encouraged by these positive results and look forward to further work to determine the ultimate scale of this exciting early stage project.\n\u201cTaken together with our recently-announced friendly transaction to acquire QMX, Eldorado is well-positioned in Quebec to create additional value for our stakeholders.\u201d\nOrmaque Deposit Geology and Inferred Mineral Resource\nThe Ormaque deposit is located approximately midway between the Lamaque-Triangle Mine and the Sigma Processing Facility. It is immediately adjacent to the ore haulage decline currently under construction linking the two, with the upper part of the deposit at the same elevation as the decline (Figure 2). At current development rates the decline will reach a position adjacent to the Ormaque deposit in Q3 of 2021.\nHigh grade gold at Ormaque occurs within subhorizontal to gently south-dipping lenses consisting of quartz+carbonate+tourmaline extension veins and vein arrays and tourmaline-altered wallrock, similar in style to those historically mined in parts of the nearby Sigma Deposit (historical production of 4.5M ounces gold) and Mine #2 Deposit (over 237,000 ounces gold produced between 1950 and 1955). The extension veins are concentrated along an east-west corridor defined by a series of steeply north-dipping brittle-ductile shear zones. Nearly all of the deposit outlined to date occurs within an irregular diorite intrusion known locally as the \u201cC-Porphyry\u201d, which is also the dominant host rock at Sigma and Mine #2.\nInferred Mineral Resources are based on results of 37 diamond drillholes totalling 22,602 meters, most of which were completed since May 2018. This drilling has outlined a volume of mineralization measuring approximately 550 metres east-west, 300 metres north-south, and extending from 150 to 600 metres depth from surface. The geological model of the mineralized lenses was generated by 1) converting individual assays to composites of drill core intervals averaging > 0.5 g/t Au and a minimum length of 0.5m; 2) creating form interpolants using vein orientations of the dominant mineralized vein sets measured from oriented drill core; and 3) employing the form interpolants to correlate composites between drillholes. This process generated 23 gently-dipping mineralized lenses, with individual lenses measuring up to 15 metres thick and up to 400 metres in lateral extent (Figure 3). Individual lenses were then trimmed to exclude volumes more than 50 metres from drillhole intercepts.\nA grade estimation block model was generated using ordinary kriging of drillhole assays composited into 1m lengths and capped at 70 g/t Au to limit the influence of high-grade outliers. A 3.5 g/t cut-off grade was applied to incorporate areas of mineralization with reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction. The cut-off grade was derived from actual cost and metallurgical performance of the Triangle deposit and includes the following forward-looking assumptions:\nGold price = $US 1800/oz\n$CAD / $US exchange rate = 1.3\nMinimum mining height = 3 metres\nMining recovery = 95%\nMining dilution = 20% with no contained gold value\nMetallurgical recovery = 96%\nMineralized domains were edited to excluded volumes that did not meet or exceed a diluted cut-off grade of 3.5 g/t Au over the minimum mining height of 3 metres. Isolated cells above cut-off were also discarded.\nThe resulting inferred resource totals 2,620,000 tonnes at a grade of 9.53 g/t Au, for 803,000 contained ounces of gold. Over 60% of the resource is in the upper part of the deposit within 400 metres of surface.\nExploration Outlook\nMost of the mineralized lenses are open laterally in one or more directions, and the deposit itself is open to the east, west, and at depth. Drilling for the first half of 2021 will include infill holes within several of the upper lenses to confirm continuity of grade and thickness of the inferred resource, step-out holes targeting open extensions to these lenses, and wider step-out holes testing for longer extensions and new lenses in areas adjacent to the deposit. Some of the more prospective targets for the latter include 1) the untested area below the Fortune Zone immediately east of Ormaque, where shallow drillholes have intersected similar vein styles to those found at Ormaque, and 2) gaps in previous drilling between the Ormaque deposit and the Parallel deposit to the west (Figure 4).\nLamaque Operations Background and Regional Strategy\nThe Lamaque Operations is home to a number of large prolific gold mines, including the historic Sigma and Lamaque mines that together produced almost 10 million ounces of gold. Today, it hosts Proven and Probable gold reserves of over 1 million ounces, Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources of 1.8 million ounces of gold, and Inferred Mineral Resources of 2.8 million ounces of gold at the Triangle, Plug #4, Parallel, and Ormaque deposits.\nOur strategy in the region is designed to add a pipeline of organic opportunities within and proximal to the Lamaque-Triangle Mine, which can be exploited by leveraging existing infrastructure and Eldorado\u2019s strong operational, exploration and stakeholder expertise. We aim to achieve this by increasing our footprint in the Abitibi Greenstone Belt and through providing additional ore sources to optimize the Sigma Mill, which has a permitted capacity of 5,000 tonnes per day, far exceeding current usage of 2,200 tonnes per day.\nFigure 4: East-West longitudinal section through the Ormaque deposit looking north showing extent of mineralized lenses and areas untested by previous drilling along strike and at depth.

Back end filtration is required to maximize water recycling (dry stack tailings) as well as a SART (sulfidation, acidification re-neutralization and thickening) circuit to re-generate cyanide back to the process and to produce a saleable Cu2S copper sulfide product. Water supply to the process plant is provided by a nearby seasonally charged water dam and high voltage grid power is provided by the local utility.\nKey components of the capital cost estimate are provided in Table 4 and operating costs are provided in Table 5.\nTable 4 \u2013 Capital Cost Estimate\nInitial Capital | Cost (US$M) | Sustaining Capital | Cost (US$M) | |\nPlant direct costs | 68,008 | Underground Development | 45,723 | |\nPre-stripping | 17,628 | Plant Direct Costs | 7,800 | |\nProject indirect costs | 9,098 | Open Pit Development | 680 | |\nEPCM | 9,187 | |||\nInfrastructure | 4,890 | |||\nTotal | 108,811 | Total | 54,203 | |\nContingency (15%) | 16,321 | Contingency (15%) | 8,130 | |\nTotal \u2013 Initial Capital | 125,132 | Total \u2013 Sustaining Capital | 62,333 | |\nCapital \u2013 Initial & Sustaining | 187,465 |\nTable 5 \u2013 Operating Costs (Average LOM)\nOperating Costs (Average LOM) | US$/tonne Plant Feed | US$/tonne |\nOpen Pit Mining1 | 18.33 | 1.89 |\nUnderground Mining2 | 30.31 | |\nTotal LOM Mining3 | 22.32 | |\nProcessing ($/t processed) | 16.26 | |\nGeneral and admin ($/t processed) | 1.54 | |\nTotal ($/t processed) | 40.12 |\n1. | Open pit mining costs include a double-benched waste rock of $1.82/t and mineralized material cost of $2.52/t. |\n2. | Bulk underground long hole mining. $30.31 is the cost of in-stope mining, additional development costs of $12.35/t mined are included in sustaining capital in table 4, providing a total UG mining cost of $42.66/t. |\n3. | Average LOM mining cost of both open pit and underground. |\nMining\nThe open pit mining will be contracted and carried out by drill and blast followed by conventional loading and truck haulage to the waste rock storage facilities and the processing plant. The contract underground mining will involve long hole stoping and cemented paste back filling of the mined-out stopes. A cement reinforced plug will be placed in the bottom of the open pits after they are mined out to provide additional support for underground mining of the crown pillars to maximize mineralized material recovery.\nMetallurgy\nA metallurgical test program was carried out by SGS Lakefield of Ontario, Canada. The program included grinding and leaching as well as comminution testing. The leach samples comprised of drill core sampling rejects representing the various zones of the Mineral Resource and whole HQ drill core for the comminution work. This preliminary test program estimated a gold and silver respective metallurgical recoveries of 93% and 88%.\nSurface Rights Agreement\nThe Company has an agreement with the Ejido of Cinco Minas, which owns the surface rights over all of those concessions included in this PEA. The agreement allows GoGold to mine and explore the 1,280 hectares of land that is owned by the local Ejido for a period of twelve years with an option to renew for a further twelve years.\nMineral Resource Estimate\nThe basis for the PEA is the Mineral Resource Estimate completed by P&E in the National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report on the Initial Mineral Resource Estimate for the Los Ricos South Project located in Jalisco State, Mexico, which has an effective date of July 28, 2020.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.35% lower, while Japan's Nikkei lost 0.86%.\nThe European Central Bank should expand bond purchases or even increase the quota earmarked for them if needed to keep yields down, ECB board member Fabio Panetta said on Tuesday, after weeks of steady increases in borrowing costs.\nMore in Business\nAustralia's central bank on Tuesday affirmed its pledge to keep interest rates at historic lows as policymakers battle to stop surging bond yields from disrupting the country's surprisingly strong economic recovery.\nAfter a sharp selloff last week, U.S. Treasuries have stabilized with bond market indicators and derivatives positioning pointing to near-term calm. But an improving economy could trigger another slide in their prices.\nU.S. Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard said she was closely watching bond markets and would be concerned if a recent rise in yields continued and began to constrain economic activity.\n\"Some of those moves last week and the speed of the moves caught my eye,\" Brainard said on Tuesday.\nYields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond have stabilized after hitting a one-year high of 1.614% last week. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 11/32 in price to yield 1.4085%, from 1.446% late on Monday.\nGold prices rose, inching up from a more than eight-month low, as a retreat in the dollar and U.S. Treasury yields lifted demand for the safe-haven metal.\nSpot gold added 0.7% to $1,735.41 an ounce. U.S. gold futures settled up 0.6% at $1,733.60.\nThe dollar index fell 0.263%, with the euro up 0.33% to $1.2087.\nEarlier, the dollar was up for a fourth consecutive day after the spike in bond yields challenged the market consensus for dollar weakness in 2021. But riskier currencies rose as bond markets calmed and stocks recovered.\nBitcoin fell 2.55% to $47,640.44 after rising nearly 7% on Monday.\nShares in mainland China and Hong Kong fell overnight after a top regulatory official expressed concerns about the risk of bubbles bursting in foreign markets.\nOil prices largely shrugged off expectations that OPEC would agree to raise oil supplies at a meeting this week.\n\"The recovery is looking really good to us,\" Occidental Petroleum Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said. \"If you look at what's happening in India as well as the U.S., I think the oil industry is looking like things will be pretty good for us over next couple of years.\"\nU.S. crude futures settled down 89 cents at $59.75 a barrel, while Brent futures fell 99 cents to settle at $62.70 a barrel.\n(Reporting by Suzanne Barlyn; Editing by Dan Grebler)",

It is a potential satellite deposit to the already permitted La India, America and Mestiza open pits.\nThe drill programme has three main objectives: 1) to increase the Inferred Mineral Resource on the Cacao Vein. 2) to increase the strike length of the vein towards the Santa Barbara prospect, 3 km away. 3) to prove the structural geological model that Cacao represents a dilational opening between two major basement feeder zones (the La India and Andrea Corridors).\nHighlights\n-\n5,000 m diamond drill programme commenced at the Cacao prospect at La India Project with the objective of increasing its mineral resource.\n-\nDrilling will concentrate on demonstrating the depth of the main gold mineralisation level and extending it along strike.\n-\nCacao already hosts an Inferred Mineral Resource of 662 Kt at 2.8 g/t gold for 60,000 oz gold defined by Condor from 2,890 m drilling in 2019.\n-\nCacao is a highly prospective target, sitting on a major dilational opening between two major feeder zones (La India and Andrea Corridors).\n-\nThe Cacao vein is one of the thickest in the district, comparable to the main La India Vein. Mineral textures are identical to La India\n-\nIsolated exposures of quartz veins in bedrock and colluvium suggest the Cacao structure extends for 3-4 km. Samples from active artisanal mine workings in the Rio Viejo, approximately 1.6 km along strike from Cacao returned assays of up to 11.6 g/t gold.\n-\nA hot spring deposit (sinter) at Cacao indicates minimal erosion, with the entire epithermal system preserved. Sinter is the rock found at the top of an epithermal boiling zone.\n-\nHigher grades at depth at Cacao. Previous drilling indicates improving gold grade at depth, suggesting the presence of a boiling-related bonanza zone.\n-\nMineralisation is open down-dip and along strike.\n-\nHistoric drilling by Condor demonstrated broad zones of gold mineralisation: intercepts included: 7.85 m at 3.75 g/t, 7.85 m at 2.95 g/t, and 17.1 m at 1.74 g/t gold. The principal vein shows excellent continuity.\n-\nUnderlying felsic, glassy volcanic rocks are anticipated at depth. These are a more favourable host for veining, for example at La India. The andesite/felsic contact may be especially favourable for veining and bonanza grade.\n-\nPotential satellite mine: the prospect is only 4 km from the planned and permitted processing plant at La India.\nMark Child, Chairman and CEO commented:\n\"Condor has successfully permitted a new processing plant of up to 2,800 tpd, along with the associated mine site infrastructure, and is currently completing detailed engineering studies to make the project \u2018shovel ready'. Initial production is expected to be 120,000 oz gold p.a. from three permitted open pits. In parallel, Condor is now embarking on the exciting second part of its strategy: demonstrating the potential for a 5 Moz Gold District with the initial focus on a 5,000 m drilling programme at Cacao.\nPlease see http://www.condorgold.com/content/technical-videos or if you are viewing from Canada http://ca.condorgold.com/content/technical-videos. The Company considers that the significant potential of Cacao is now demonstrated via its 2,890 m of drilling, resultant Inferred Mineral Resource of 662 Kt at 2.8 g/t gold for 60,000 oz gold and subsequent geological interpretation. Cacao is open at depth and along strike in both directions. The vein width is comparable to the best intersections at La India and the hanging wall of the vein is increasingly stockworked, as at La India. Structurally controlled ore shoots, as at La India, are to be expected in this major dilational, and continuous, vein. The next phase of drilling at Cacao will test the interpretation that it is largely a concealed gold deposit. It aims to demonstrate the depth of the main gold mineralisation and extend it along strike and increase the Inferred Mineral Resource.\"\nGeological Setting\nThe Cacao target is hosted by flat-lying andesites and is separated from the La India, America and Mestiza veins by the Highway Fault (Figure 1). This fault was active after vein mineralisation and dropped down rocks to the east. This explains the presence of a chalcedonic phreatic breccia and hot spring deposit (sinter) at Cacao. These typically form upon, and immediately beneath, the original ground surface. Consequently, the gold mineralised epithermal vein system at Cacao has been \u2018preserved' in its entirety. The vein which fed the hot spring is only present at depth. This contrasts with the veins west of the Highway Fault, including La India, where erosion directly exposes the high grade (bonanza) level of the epithermal system. This made the veins west of Highway Fault significantly easier to locate. Cacao is therefore a \u2018concealed' target that failed to attract the attention of both Noranda Mining, which mined at La India before 1956, and informal miners.\nFigure 1: Location of Cacao Relative to Permitted Mine Site Infrastructure\nBackground; Discovery to Inferred Mineral Resource\nAn east-west-striking ridge of chalcedonic phreatic breccia, 10 to 50 m wide and about 600 m long, was first identified at Cacao in 2006. Rock chip and trench sampling by Condor in 2006-2007 identified some gold-bearing subvertical crustiform quartz veins up to 1 m thick within the breccia. But, unlike the significant veins at La India and America, they are discontinuous and were never exploited by informal miners.\nDrilling in 2007 and 2008 demonstrated that the phreatic breccia narrows downwards and gives way to a higher grade, classic crustiform epithermal vein. This vein is identical to those mined by Noranda at La India. Identification of float boulders of hot spring sinter in 2015 motivated further drilling in 2016, to test the model of a concealed boiling level. As at La India, the drilling identified numerous mineralising \u2018events', with early hydrothermal breccias cut by later crustiform veins. This long-lived hydrothermal system resulted in some significant veins and intercepts of up to 7.85 m (3.9 m true thickness) at 3.75 g/t gold (CCDC023, approximately 150 m below surface).\nDrilling to date (26 holes, total of 2890 m) has only tested below the ridge of chalcedonic breccia. The best intercepts are shown in Table 1.\nThe current programme has commenced with 1 drill rig and will continue to test deeper, but will also test the strike potential. Eastwards the mineralisation dives beneath a major alluvial fan, about 20 m thick. Deeply eroded streams in the fan show large boulders of silicified rock and sinter directly along strike; this implies the vein continues. The Cacao Vein reappears from the alluvium in the Rio Viejo, about 1.6 km east of Cacao. There, several parallel veins are exploited by informal miners. Grab samples give up to 11.6 g/t Au. The structure(s) then disappears below more alluvium, before re-emerging on Condor's Santa Barbara Concession, about 3 km east of Cacao. Float boulders at Santa Barbara show excellent epithermal vein textures; grab samples give up to 1.8 g/t Au. Nearby, in situ veins, within rhyolite, give up to 15.8 g/t Au. (Figure 2).\nTable 1: Drill Results on Cacao Vein\n| Drill | Collar UTM WGS84-16N | Drill inclination/azimuth | From | To | Drill | *True | Au | Ag | Other | |\n| CCRD002 | 580398E 1412068N 478 m RL | -63/360 | 87.00 | 101.05 | 14.05 | 6.4 | 6.05 | 2.5 | Includes 1 m @ 16.5 g/t & 1 m @ 10.75 g/t Au | |\n| CCRD004 | 580318E 1412087N 477 m RL | -65/360 | 123.35 | 128.90 | 5.55 | 1.9 | 6.10 | 12.2 | Includes 3.6 m @ 8.57 g/t Au | |\n| CCRD006 | 580157E 1412086N 465 m RL | -63/360 | 93.12 | 106.95 | 13.83 | 4.3 | 2.25 | 4.3 | Includes 1 m @ 8.17 g/t Au | |\n| 132.90 | 135.50 | 2.60 | 0.8 | 34.13 | 4.8 | Includes 0.85 m @ 99.7 g/t Au | ||||\n| CCRD014 | 580320E 1411942N 457 m RL | -55/360 | 134.63 | 137.28 | 2.65 | 1.7 | 8.45 | - | Includes 0.85 m @ 20.1 g/t Au | |\n| 144.18 | 148.63 | 4.45 | 2.9 | 1.21 | - | |||||\n| CCDC020 | 580158E 1411940N 452 m RL | -61/360 | 154.50 | 159.28 | 4.78 | 3.0 | 1.37 | - | ||\n| 163.00 | 167.15 | 4.15 | 2.6 | 2.93 | - | |||||\n| CCDC023 | 580318E 1411946N 457 m RL | -64/360 | 157.40 | 165.25 | 7.85 | 3.9 | 3.75 | 5.1 | Includes 0.9 m @ 11.9 g/t & 0.5 m @ 12.6 g/t Au | |\n| 167.30 | 169.50 | 2.20 | 1.1 | 2.24 | 10.2 | |||||\n| CCDC024 | 580154E 1411939N 452 m RL | -70/360 | 199.75 | 207.60 | 7.85 | 4.2 | 2.95 | 17.2 | Includes 2 m @ 6.06 g/t Au | |\n| CCDC025 | 580370E 1411957N 458 m RL | -52/360 | 80.00 | 82.30 | 2.30 | 1.5 | 1.31 | <2 | ||\n| 92.70 | 109.80 | 17.10 | 11.2 | 1.74 | 1.3 | Includes 1.7 m @ 6.0 g/t Au |\nFigure 2: Geological map with the inferred Cacao-Santa Barbara Vein.\nMineral Resource Estimation\nResource modelling suggests that Cacao is amenable to open pit and underground mining, despite the lower grades encountered at surface. A mineral resource estimate is shown in Table 2.\nTable 2: Cacao Inferred Mineral Resource, prepared in accordance with CIM and Canadian NI 43-101 (25th January 2019; SRK Consulting (UK) Ltd).\n| Vein name | Cut-off | Tonnes (kt) | Gold grade (g/t) | Contained gold (koz) |\n| El Cacao(1) | 0.5 g/t (OP) | 188 | 2.3 | 14 |\n| El Cacao(2) | 2.0 g/t (UG) | 474 | 3.0 | 46 |\n| (1) The methods applied to conducting the geological modelling and estimation have not changed from those described in the Technical Report. The Cacao pits are amenable to open pit mining and the Mineral Resource Estimates are constrained within Whittle optimised pits, which SRK based on the following parameters: A Gold price of USD1,500 per ounce of gold with no adjustments. Prices are based on experience gained from other SRK projects. Metallurgical recovery assumptions are between 91-96% for gold, based on testwork conducted to date. Marginal costs of USD19.36/t for processing, USD5.69/t G&A and USD2.35/t for mining, slope angles defined by the Company Geotechnical study which range from angle 40 - 48\u00b0, a haul cost of USD1.25/t was added to the Mestiza ore tonnes to consider transportation to the processing plant. | ||||\n| (2) Underground Mineral Resources beneath the open pit are reported at a cut-off grade of 2.0 g/t over a minimum width of 1.0m. Cut-off grades are based on a price of USD1,500 per ounce of gold and gold recoveries of 91 percent for resources, costs of USD19.36/t for processing, USD4.55/t G&A and USD50.0/t for mining, without considering revenues from other metals. |\nThe Company considers that the significant potential of Cacao is now demonstrated. It is open at depth and along strike. The vein width is comparable to, or greater than, the best intersections at La India. The epithermal textures indicate boiling conditions, good for high-grade gold. And, as at La India, structurally controlled ore shoots are expected in this major dilational, and continuous, vein. The next phase of approximately 5,000 m of drilling will test the interpretation that Cacao is a major concealed gold deposit. Drilling will concentrate on demonstrating the depth of the main gold mineralisation level and extending it along strike.\n- Ends -\nFor further information please visit www.condorgold.com or contact:\n| Condor Gold plc | Mark Child, Chairman and CEO +44 (0) 20 7493 2784 | |\n| Beaumont Cornish Limited | Roland Cornish and James Biddle +44 (0) 20 7628 3396 | |\n| SP Angel Corporate Finance LLP | Ewan Leggat +44 (0) 20 3470 0470 | |\n| Blytheweigh | Tim Blythe and Megan Ray +44 (0) 20 7138 3204 |\nAbout Condor Gold plc:\nCondor Gold plc was admitted to AIM in May 2006 and dual listed on the TSX in January 2018. The Company is a gold exploration and development company with a focus on Nicaragua.\nIn August 2018, the Company announced that the Ministry of the Environment in Nicaragua had granted the Environmental Permit (\"EP\") for the development, construction and operation of a processing plant with capacity to process up to 2,800 tonnes per day at its wholly-owned La India gold project (\"La India Project\"). The EP is considered the master permit for mining operations in Nicaragua. Condor Gold published a Pre-Feasibility Study (\"PFS\") on the project in December 2014, summarised in the Technical Report, as defined below. The PFS details an open pit gold Mineral Reserve in the Probable category of 6.9 Mt at 3.0 g/t gold for 675,000 oz gold, producing 80,000 oz gold per annum for 7 years. La India Project contains a Mineral Resource of 9,850 Kt at 3.6 g/t gold for 1.14 Moz gold in the Indicated category and 8,479 Kt at 4.3 g/t gold for 1.18 Moz gold in the Inferred category. The Indicated Mineral Resource is inclusive of the Mineral Reserve. A gold price of $1,500/oz and a cut-off grade of 0.5 g/t and 2.0 g/t gold were assumed for open pit and underground resources, respectively. A cut-off grade of 1.5 g/t gold was furthermore applied within a part of the Inferred Resource. Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that any part of the Mineral Resources will be converted to Mineral Reserves.\nEnvironmental Permits were granted in April and May 2020 for the Mestiza and America open pits respectively, both located close to La India. The Mestiza open pit hosts 92 Kt at a grade of 12.1 g/t gold (36,000 oz contained gold) in the Indicated Mineral Resource category and 341 Kt at a grade of 7.7 g/t gold (85,000 oz contained gold) in the Inferred Mineral Resource category. The America open pit hosts 114 Kt at a grade of 8.1 g/t gold (30,000 oz) in the Indicated Mineral Resource category and 677 Kt at a grade of 3.1 g/t gold (67,000 oz) in the Inferred Mineral Resource category. Following the permitting of the Mestiza and America open pits, together with the La India open pit Condor has 1.12 Moz gold open pit Mineral Resources permitted for extraction, inclusive of a Mineral Reserve of 6.9 Mt at 3.0 g/t gold for 675,000 oz gold.\nDisclaimer\nNeither the contents of the Company's website nor the contents of any website accessible from hyperlinks on the Company's website (or any other website) is incorporated into, or forms part of, this announcement.\nQualified Persons\nThe Mineral Resource Estimate has been completed by Ben Parsons, a Principal Consultant (Resource Geology) with SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc, who is a Member of the Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, MAusIMM(CP).

This occurs where movement of the rock masses is at an oblique direction to the fault plane and can occur along extensive areas of the fault or in localised zones due to a curved or irregular shaped fault plane. |\n| Down-dip | Further down towards the deepest parts of an ore body or zone of mineralisation. |\n| Epithermal | Hydrothermal deposits formed at shallow depths below a boiling hot spring system are commonly referred to as epithermal, a term retained from an old system of classifying hydrothermal deposits based on the presumed temperature and depth of deposition. |\n| Fault | The plane along which two rock masses have moved or slide against each other in opposing directions. |\n| Felsic | Igneous rock relatively rich in the minerals feldspar and silica. It is a broad term including the the common intrusive rocks granite and diorite, and the volcanic rocks rhyolite and dacite, |\n| Grade | The proportion of a mineral within a rock or other material. For gold mineralisation this is usually reported as grams of gold per tonne of rock (g/t) |\n| g/t | grams per tonne |\n| Hot springs | A spring of naturally hot water, typically heated by subterranean volcanic activity. |\n| Hydrothermal | Hot water caused by heating of groundwater by near surface magmas and often occurring in association with volcanic activity. Hydrothermal waters can contain significant concentrations of dissolved minerals. |\n| Inferred Mineral Resource | That part of a Mineral Resource for which tonnage, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a low level of confidence.

Pursuant to the terms of the Stream Agreement:\nEURO will make a cash payment of US$7,150,000 to Orezone on closing as consideration for the purchase of 50% of the payable silver produced at Bombor\u00e9 for life of mine.\nOrezone is to deliver a minimum annual payment equivalent to 37,500 ounces of silver to EURO commencing from the date of commercial production for Bombor\u00e9. Should there be a shortfall in the annual silver deliveries, Orezone will make an initial catch-up payment only on the later of: (a) the fifth anniversary from the date of the initial silver delivery under the Stream Agreement and (b) repayment of senior secured term loan for development of Bombor\u00e9, to ensure the aggregate minimum annual payment has been satisfied for each of the preceding years. Thereafter, Orezone will make catch up payments, if required, on an annual basis until the cumulative delivery or payment of 375,000 ounces of silver after which the minimum annual payment guarantee will no longer apply. Orezone will provide a parental guarantee to EURO in favour of its Burkina Faso subsidiary to secure its obligations under the Silver Stream.\nIf, within the first five years of the life of mine, Bombor\u00e9\u2019s sulphide processing plant achieves an average throughput rate 50% above the 2019 feasibility study design capacity, Orezone has the right to buy back 50% of the Silver Stream from EURO for US$7,150,000.\nEURO has a right of first refusal, for the life of mine, over any further silver production from Bombor\u00e9 that has not been purchased by EURO pursuant to the Silver Stream.\nThe completion of the Silver Stream is subject to standard precedent conditions for a transaction of this nature.\nExploration Potential\nThe primary objective of the previous drilling at Bombor\u00e9 was to bring the main shear zone to the Measured and Indicated categories to support a feasibility study and subsequent project financing in a cost-effective manner. With Bombor\u00e9 being fully financed, this silver stream transaction allows the Company the opportunity to perform additional drilling to investigate further expansion potential on the project.\nTargets include:\nExtension Drilling \u2013 Additional drilling between known mineralized zones to establish continuity\nInfill Drilling \u2013 Converting near-pit oxide and sulphide inferred resources to M&I to incorporate into the mine plan\nRegional Drilling \u2013 Numerous prospective targets have been identified on the exploration claims\nExtension drilling to confirm continuity between mineralized zones\nThe Bombor\u00e9 project spans over 13kms and is yet to be fully defined. Several isolated mineralized zones are believed to be continuous but have not been drilled sufficiently to confirm such continuity. Two such zones identified as high priority drill targets are the P17 sulphide zone and the hanging wall oxide zone at Maga.\nP17 - P17S Gap - Figure 1\nThis high priority exploration target was discovered late in project development and recent drilling has defined high-grade sulphide resources1 at P17S. Unlike the main moderately dipping shear zone of the project, the P17S and P17 zones are plunging folded granodiorite bodies with grades more than double that of the overall average grade for the project. Drilling just to the north of the P17S reserve pit indicates that the orebodies are still open and that repeat folding is evident and trending towards the surface at P17, 1.2kms to the north.\nDrilling at the P17 zone also returned excellent intercepts and there is a large untested gap between these two areas. The objective of future drilling will be to infill this large, underexplored area and expand the high-grade resources and reserves.\nThe Maga area in the northern end of the Bombor\u00e9 mining permit has both oxide and sulphide drill targets. The oxide targets in the hanging wall were previously inaccessible prior to the recent relocation of families to their new resettlement villages. Shallow RC drilling in this area will focus on establishing continuity between oxide pits along this strike extent of approximately 2kms of previous wide-spaced drilling. Limited previous drilling together with auger drilling and historic artisanal gold workings all outside of current reserve pits, provide strong indication that the mineralized structures hosting the current reserves display good lateral continuity and are very prospective to expand these reserves.\nInfill drilling to convert Inferred resources to Measured and Indicated\nHigh-grade sulphide inferred mineralized zones are located directly below or along strike of several sulphide pits in the current mineral reserves, and previous drilling suggests that these zones are both wide and continuous at Siga South where the sulfide zone definition drilling is most advanced. Orezone has identified 3 main target areas for sulphide resource drilling: Maga, Siga South and Siga East. Drilling will focus on upgrading these inferred resources to M&I which could result in an increase in reserves and future plant expansions.\nTable 1: Significant drill intercepts from inferred blocks outside of reserve pits\nDeposit\nHole #\nFrom (m)\nTo (m)\nLength (m)\nGrade (g/t gold)\nSiga East\nBBC2329\n41.00\n46.00\n5.00\n2.19\nBBD0246\n43.50\n63.00\n19.50\n6.06\nBBD0450\n208.00\n215.00\n7.00\n3.23\nBBC4555\n56.00\n63.00\n7.00\n2.11\nBBD0241\n69.00\n73.50\n4.50\n3.86\nBBC4549\n57.00\n64.00\n7.00\n2.07\nBBC4788\n63.00\n70.00\n7.00\n2.19\nSiga South\nBBD0647\n157.00\n175.00\n18.00\n1.73\nBBD0181\n89.00\n123.50\n34.50\n1.18\nBBD0182\n122.50\n169.00\n46.50\n1.35\nBBD0183\n167.00\n213.50\n46.50\n1.13\nBBD0178\n157.00\n196.00\n39.00\n1.75\nBBD0179\n184.00\n211.00\n27.00\n1.01\nBBD0179\n214.00\n230.50\n16.50\n1.80\nBBD0174\n153.00\n193.50\n40.50\n1.20\nBBD0170\n117.00\n129.00\n12.00\n14.52\nBBD0167\n142.00\n161.50\n19.50\n1.74\nBBC4506\n40.00\n55.00\n15.00\n7.54\nMaga Hill\nBBD0904\n174.00\n187.00\n13.00\n1.58\nBBD0803\n105.00\n113.00\n8.00\n5.88\nBBD0803\n150.00\n160.00\n10.00\n1.55\nBBD0133\n97.50\n111.00\n13.50\n3.50\nBBD0878\n65.00\n76.00\n11.00\n2.62\nBBD0136\n66.00\n76.00\n10.00\n3.76\n* True widths for Siga East and Siga South drilling are 100% of drilled lengths ** True widths for Maga Hill drilling are approximately 95% of drilled lengths\nRegional drilling for mine life extension\nOrezone has 14,547 hectares of exploration claims surrounding its mining lease with numerous prospective targets that have been identified. Future drilling is also warranted on these targets.\nProject Debt Package\nThe Company is progressing with documentation on the Senior Debt Facility and its US$35M Convertible Note Facility with a conversion price of US$1.08.

La Colorada, together with the San Juan and Yecora veins, continue to deliver near surface, high-grade silver and gold results over significant widths. These results are being incorporated into the maiden San Juan Area resource estimation, expanding the mineralized zones along strike and down dip.\"\nSan Juan Area Drilling Details\nThe following figure (Figure 1) illustrates the location of all surface drill holes released to date on the San Juan Area. The La Colorada and Yecora Veins represent a combined 1,000 m long vein system parallel to the San Juan Vein system. Hole LCS21-04 expanded the known mineralization by 50 m to the south, at a similar elevation to the previously reported high-grade LCS18-03 hole (1,723 g/t AgEq over 2.7 m [15.1 g/t Au, 45 g/t Ag, 3.1 % Pb and 0.9 % Zn], including 5,055 g/t AgEq over 0.9 m [46.9 g/t Au, 76 g/t Ag, 3.3 % Pb and 2.2 % Zn]). Results from drill hole LCS21-04 also confirm that the La Colorada Vein is connected along strike with the Yecora Vein, due to the proximity of previously reported high-grade intersections on both veins (Figure 2).\n________________ |\n1 AgEq is based on long term gold, silver, zinc, lead and copper prices of US$1,600 per ounce gold, US$16.50 per ounce silver, US$0.85 per pound zinc, US$0.95 per pound lead and US$2.00 per pound copper. The metallurgical recoveries are assumed as 90% Ag, 95% Au, 78% Pb, 70% Zn and 70% Cu. |\nHole LCS21-05, also being reported in this News Release, is located approximately 100 m south of LCS21-04, The mineralized zone in this hole returned wide, but lower-grade assays results, including 33.0 m @ 59 g/t AgEq. Assay results for LCS21-06 to LCS21-11 are pending release from the laboratory.\nThe La Colorada vein is a hydrothermal breccia that contains Au-Ag-Pb-Zn values in a mineralized quartz and hematite matrix. It is hosted in andesite and ignimbrite country rock. Sphalerite, galena and acanthite (Ag-bearing mineral) are found in the quartz veins.\nThe longitudinal section (Figure 2) represents the N-S trend of the San Juan Area, displaying the location of all surface and underground drill holes released to date and the upside potential for additional Ag-Au mineralization to be discovered along strike and down dip.\nThe Company has released results from a total of 368 surface and underground drill holes from the Plomosas Project, which also includes the San Juan Area. All results released for this area are being incorporated into a 3D model for resource estimation.\nQualified Person\nThe scientific and technical data contained in this News Release related to the Plomosas Project was reviewed and/or prepared under the supervision of Marcio Fonseca, P. Geo. He has approved the disclosure herein.\nQuality Assurance Program and Quality Control Procedures (\"QA/QC\")\nThe Company has implemented QA/QC procedures which include insertion of blank, duplicate and standard samples in all sample lots sent to SGS de M\u00e9xico, S.A. de C.V laboratory facilities in Durango, Mexico, for sample preparation and assaying. For every sample with results above Ag >100 ppm (over limits), these samples are submitted directly by SGS de Mexico to SGS Canada Inc at Burnaby, BC. The analytical methods are 4-acid Digest and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry with Lead Fusion Fire Assay with gravimetric finish for silver above over limits. For gold assays the analytical methods are Lead Fusion and Atomic Absorption Spectrometry Lead Fusion Fire Assay and gravimetric finish for gold above over limits.\nThe recent drill holes, completed by First Majestic from 2016 to 2018, followed QA/QC protocols reviewed and validated by GR Silver Mining, including insertion of blank and standard samples in all sample lots sent to First Majestic's Laboratorio Central facilities in La Parilla, Durango, for sample preparation and assaying. Additional validation and check assays were performed by an independent laboratory at SGS de M\u00e9xico, S.A. de C.V. facilities in Durango, Mexico. The analytical methods applied for these recent holes for Ag and Au assays comprised of Fire Assay with Atomic Absorption finish for samples above Au >10ppm and Ag >300ppm and Gravimetric Finish. Lead and Zn were analyzed using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry. GR Silver Mining has not received information related to the Grupo Mexico QA/QC and assay protocols and at this stage is considering the information historic for news release purposes.\nAbout GR Silver Mining Ltd.\nGR Silver Mining Ltd. is a Mexico-focused Company engaged in cost-effective silver-gold resource expansion on its 100%-owned assets which lie on the eastern edge of the Rosario Mining District, in the southeast of Sinaloa State, Mexico.\nPlomosas Silver Project\nGR Silver Mining's 8,515 ha Plomosas Silver Project is located near the historic mining village of La Rastra and within 5 km of the Company's San Marcial Silver Project, in the Rosario Mining District. The Project is a past-producing asset where only one mine, the Plomosas lead-zinc(-silver-gold) underground mine, operated a 600 tpd crush-mill-flotation circuit from 1986 to 2001, producing approximately 8 M ounces of silver, 73 M pounds of lead and 28 M pounds of zinc.\nThe March 2020 acquisition of the Plomosas Silver Project included 563 historical and recent drill holes from both surface and underground locations. These drill holes represent an extensive database allowing the Company to advance towards resource estimation and potential project development in the near future.\nThe Company is completing a drilling program with surface holes focused on expanding known mineralization along strike in two areas, the Plomosas Mine Area and the San Juan Area. Underground drilling included in the program is targeting the extension of recent Au-rich discoveries at the lowest level (775 m RL, or ~250 m below surface) of the Plomosas Mine Area and six low sulphidation epithermal veins at the San Juan Area. Both areas are currently the subject of NI 43-101 resource estimations.\nThe assets include all facilities and infrastructure including access roads, surface rights agreement, water use permit, 8,000 m of underground workings, water access, 60 km - 33 KV power line, offices, shops, 120-person camp, infirmary, warehouses and assay lab representing approximately US$30 M of previous capital investments. The previous owners invested approximately US$18 M in exploration, including extensive geophysics and geochemistry programs.\nThe silver-gold mineralization on this Project displays the alteration, textures, mineralogy and deposit geometry characteristics of a low sulphidation epithermal silver-gold-base metal mineralized vein/breccia system. Previous exploration was focused on polymetallic (Pb-Zn+/-Ag-Au) shallow mineralization, hosted in NW-SE structures in the vicinity of the Plomosas Mine. The E-W portion of the mineralization and extensions of the main N-S Plomosas Fault remain under-explored.\nIn addition to the resource potential at Plomosas, a review of the existing drill hole database, geophysical surveys and geochemical data covering most of the concession, has defined 16 new exploration targets of which 11 have high priority for future exploration programs.\nSan Marcial Project\nSan Marcial is a near-surface, high-grade silver-lead-zinc open pit-amenable project. The Company filed a National Instrument 43-101 (\"NI 43-101\") report entitled \"San Marcial Project Resource Estimation and Technical Report, Sinaloa, Mexico\" having an effective date of March 18, 2019 and an amended date of June 10, 2020 (the \"Report\"), which contains a 36 Moz AgEq (Indicated) and 11 Moz AgEq (Inferred) resource estimate. The Report was prepared by Todd McCracken and Marcelo Filipov of WSP Canada Inc. and is available on SEDAR. The company recently completed over 320 m of underground development in the San Marcial Resource Area, from which underground drilling is planned to expand the high-grade portions of the resource down-dip. The Company recently discovered additional mineralization in the footwall, outside of the existing resource, and will also be drilling this area. GR Silver Mining is the first company to conduct exploration at San Marcial in over 10 years.\nRecent exploration has identified silver and gold mineralization in areas previously defined as non-mineralized, discovering evidence of pervasively altered rocks with intense silicification, veining and associated wide, silver and gold mineralized zones on the footwall of the NI 43-101 resource area.\nLa Trinidad Project\nThe La Trinidad Project was acquired in March 2021. While La Trinidad has been the focus of artisanal mining activity over many decades, commercial operations began late in the 20th century. Anaconda Minerals Corp. was first to drill the project in the mid-late 1980s. After initially taking up an option on the Project in 1993, Eldorado Gold Corp. then commenced an open pit gold mine at La Trinidad in 1995, known as the Taunus Pit, with ore being processed via a heap leach operation. The mine operated until 1998, producing approximately 52,000 oz of gold2.\nExploration undertaken by Oro Gold from 2006 identified additional resources below the Taunus Pit and operations recommenced late in 2014. Gold output from the heap leach pads continued until late 2019 for a total cumulative production by Oro Gold of 112,000 oz gold3,4. In addition to La Trinidad, the portfolio acquired by GR Silver Mining includes an extensive regional database of geological, geochemical and geophysical information resulting from historical exploration expenditure by Oro Gold of more than CDN$18.6 M since 2006.\nCimarron Project\nCimarron is another advanced stage project that was acquired along with the La Trinidad Project in March 2021 and is located 40 km to the NW of La Trinidad. A number of targets have been identified at Cimarron including Calerita, El Prado, Huanacaxtle, Betty and Veteranos, however Calerita is the only target to have been drilled to date. The near surface historical Inferred Resource at the Calerita prospect contains 3.7 Mt at 0.65 g/t Au for approximately 77,000 oz of gold5, which is considered to be open along strike and down dip.\nWhile the 2011 resource is considered by GR Silver Mining to be a historical resource, the Company considers the resource estimate as being relevant and reliable, considering a lack of significant additional exploration work since its release. A key parameter in the historical resource is the usage of a US$1,200/oz gold price compared to a much higher current spot gold price. A Qualified Person (QP) would be required to review the historical resource report and make recommendations in order to verify and upgrade it to a current resource. A QP has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current mineral resources. The Company is treating the 2011 resource estimate as a historical estimate. The company plans to re-assess the work completed by previous owners and define the feasibility of additional drilling, aiming at identifying additional near-surface mineralization.\nThe Plomosas, San Marcial and La Trinidad Projects collectively represent a geological setting resembling the multi-million-ounce San Dimas Mining District which has historically produced more than 600 Moz Ag and 11 Moz Au over a period of more than 100 years.\nOther Projects\nGR Silver Mining's other projects are situated in areas attractive for future discoveries and development in the same vicinity of Plomosas, La Trinidad and San Marcial in the Rosario Mining District. Following the acquisition of Marlin Gold Mining Ltd. (\"Marlin\") in March 2021, GR Silver Mining controls a concession portfolio of over 1,000 km2, two previously producing mines fully permitted for future developments and a total combined 75 km of structures with field evidence of 24 Ag-Au veins in historic old workings.\n___________ |\n2 Refer to Marlin Gold Mining Ltd. 2nd Amended NI 43-101 Technical Report dated February 1, 2013 |\n3 Refer to Marlin Gold Mining Ltd.

(TSX: DNG / OTC: DNGDF) (Dynacor or the Corporation) released its unaudited consolidated financial statements and the management's discussion and analysis (MD&A) for the second quarter ended June 30, 2021.\nThese documents have been filed electronically with SEDAR at www.sedar.com and will be available on the Corporation's website www.dynacor.com.\n(All figures in this press release are in Ms of US$ unless stated otherwise. All amounts per share are in US$. All variance % are calculated from rounded figures. Some additions might be incorrect due to rounding).\nQ2-2021 OVERVIEW AND HIGHLIGHTS\nOVERVIEW\nDynacor completed the three-month period ended June 30, 2021 (\u201cQ2-2021\u201d) reporting a new quarterly sales record with $42.8 million in sales and a net income of $2.2 million (US$ 0.06 per share), still ahead of its annual guidance, compared to sales of $8.0 million and a net loss of (-$0.7 million) (-US$0.02 per share) in the second quarter of 2020 (\u201cQ2-2020\u201d). Without mitigating the very solid Q2-2021 performance, the Q2-2020 comparative figures had been significantly impacted by the Covid-19 crisis with the temporary shut-down of the Veta Dorada plant resulting in the only quarterly loss recorded by the Corporation since 2010.\nThe Corporation ore purchasing, and processing activities continued to be very strong with 31,280 tonnes of ore purchased and 30,374 tonnes processed.\nWith growing volumes of gold sold, the Corporation was able to increase its quarterly sales for the fourth consecutive quarter.\nConsidering the fast growth of its ore purchase volume, the Corporation decided to move ahead with the construction on the plant expansion which was originally planned for the third quarter. The expansion work has been completed in June well ahead of time and under budget.\nThe plant was fully commissioned and successfully ran at 400 tonnes per day (\u201ctpd\u201d) during 11 days in June. Subsequent to the quarter end, the daily throughput was increased to the maximum capacity of 430 tpd. The mill has been operating at full capacity for the last five weeks.\nHIGHLIGHTS\nOperational\nOre inventory covering one month of production. With a new record quarter of ore purchased (31,280 tonnes in Q2-2021) and despite the increase in volume processed, the Corporation maintained a level of inventory exceeding 11,000 tonnes. This represents a 41.5% increase vs. the end of 2020.\nHighest quarterly volume processed. In Q2-2021, despite down-time periods due to maintenance or plant expansion activities, the Veta Dorada plant processed a historical high volume of 30,374 tonnes of ore (334 tpd average) compared to 29,327 in Q1-2021 (326 tpd) and 3,244 tonnes (136 tpd) in Q2-2020. (Considering 91 days in Q2-2021, 90 days in Q1-2021 and 24 potential working days due to Covid-19 restrictions plant shut-down in Q2-2020);\nAnother quarter-to-quarter production increase. During Q2-2021, gold equivalent production amounted to 25,172 AuEq ounces compared to 21,975 AuEq in Q1-2021 (14.5% increase) and 1,935 AuEq ounces in Q2-2020.\nFinancial\nRecord quarterly sales. With slightly higher average selling prices (+1.8%) and higher quantities sold (+2.7%), compared to the last record quarter (Q1-2021), sales amounted to $42.8 million in Q2-2021 compared to $40.9 million in Q1-2021 and $8.0 million in Q2-2020;\nIncreased gross operating margin. Gross operating margin of $6.5 million (15.2% of sales) in Q2-2021, compared to $5.3 million (13.0% of sales) in Q1-2021 and nil in Q2-2020;\nStrong net income. Net income and comprehensive income of $2.2 million (US$0.06 per share) similar to Q1-2021 ($2.1 million) and compared to a net loss of (-$0.7 million) in Q2-2020;\nRecord cash gross operating margin. The Q2-2021 cash gross operating margin in surpassing $300 per AuEq ounce sold (1) compared to $257 in Q1-2021 and $117 in Q2-2020;\nQuarter to quarter increase in EBITDA(2). $5.0 million compared to $4.6 million in Q1-2021 (a 8.7% increase) and nil in Q2-2020;\nStable cash-flow from operating activities before change in working capital items. Cash flow from operating activities before change in working capital items of $3.2 million (US$0.08 per share) (3), stable for the third consecutive quarter and compared to nil in Q2-2020;\nSolid cash position. Cash on hand of $13.4 million at June 30, 2021 compared to $11.9 million at year-end 2020.\nCash Return to Shareholders\n33% increase in monthly dividend from June 2021. During Q2-2021, dividends totaling $0.5 million (CA$0.6 million) were paid including a CA$0.0067 monthly dividend in June 2021.\n(1) Cash gross operating margin per AuEq ounce is in US$ and is calculated by subtracting the average cash cost of sale per equivalent ounces of Au from the average selling price per equivalent ounces of Au and is a non-IFRS financial performance measure with no standard definition under IFRS. It is therefore possible that this measure could not be comparable with a similar measure of another company.\n(2) EBITDA: \u201cEarnings before interest, taxes and depreciation\u201d is a non-IFRS financial performance measure with no standard definition under IFRS. It is therefore possible that this measure could not be comparable with a similar measure of another corporation. The Corporation uses this non-IFRS measure as an indicator of the cash generated by the operations and allows investor to compare the profitability of the Corporation with others by canceling effects of different assets bases, effects due to different tax structures as well as the effects of different capital structures.\n(3) Cash-flow per share is a non-IFRS financial performance measure with no standard definition under IFRS. It is therefore possible that this measure could not be comparable with a similar measure of another corporation. The Corporation uses this non-IFRS measure which can also be helpful to investors as it provides a result which can be compared with the Corporation market share price.\nRESULTS FROM OPERATIONS\nExtract from Consolidated Statement of net income and comprehensive income\nThree-month periods ended June 30,\nSix-month periods ended June 30,\n(in $'000)\n2021\n2020\n2021\n2020\nSales\n42,777\n8,007\n83,686\n38,876\nCost of sales\n(36,260\n)\n(7,975\n)\n(71,866\n)\n(33,895\n)\nGross operating margin\n6,517\n32\n11,820\n4,981\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n(2,002\n)\n(746\n)\n(3,210\n)\n(1,837\n)\nOther projects\n-\n(13\n)\n(16\n)\n(141\n)\nOperating income\n4,515\n(727\n)\n8,594\n3,003\nIncome before income taxes\n4,267\n(755\n)\n8,195\n2,892\nCurrent income tax expense\n(1,835\n)\n85\n(3,389\n)\n(1,137\n)\nDeferred tax expense\n(270\n)\n(15\n)\n(538\n)\n(55\n)\nNet income and comprehensive income\n2,162\n(685\n)\n4,268\n1,700\nEarnings per share\nBasic\n$\n0.06\n(-$0.02\n)\n$\n0.11\n$\n0.04\nDiluted\n$\n0.06\n(-$0.02\n)\n$\n0.11\n$\n0.04\nTotal sales amounted to $42.8 million compared to $8.0 million in Q2-2020. The significant $34.8 million increase is explained by record ore processing level, increased volumes sold, high gold prices and obviously by the Covid-19 crisis which forced the closing of operations in Q2-2020. Compared to the previous quarter (Q1-2021) sales increased by $1.9 million due to higher gold production combined with higher gold market prices.\nThe Q2-2021 gross operating margin reached $6.5 million which represents 15.2% of sales.\nGeneral and administrative expenses amounted to $2.0 million in Q2-2021 compared to $0.7 million in Q2-2020 when these expenses had been significantly reduced due to the Covid crisis. The increase compared to Q2-2020 is also due to non-recurring fees of $0.5 million including those engaged to obtain the release of the gold bars retained since December 2019 (see press release dated July 22, 2021). General and administrative expenses are expected to decrease significantly in Q3-2021.\nThe Q2-2021 net income was again affected by the recording of a $0.3 million deferred income tax expense (cumulative 2021 of $0.6 million) resulting from FX variances between the US$ and the Peruvian Sol applying on long term assets local tax basis.\nReconciliation of non-IFRS measures\n(in $'000)\nThree-month periods ended June 30,\nSix-month periods ended June 30,\n2021\n2020\n2021\n2020\nReconciliation of net income and comprehensive income to EBITDA\nNet income and comprehensive income\n2,162\n(685\n)\n4,268\n1,700\nIncome taxes\n2,105\n(70\n)\n3,926\n1,192\nFinancial expenses\n57\n31\n108\n49\nDepreciation\n648\n599\n1,291\n1,239\nEBITDA\n4,972\n(125\n)\n9,593\n4,180\nCASH FLOW FROM OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES AND WORKING CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY\nOperating activities\nDuring Q2-2021, the cash flow from operations, before changes in working capital items, amounted to $3.2 million ($6.3 million for the six-month period ending June 30, 2021), compared to (-$0.03 million) in Q2-2020 ($3.2 million for the six-month period ending June 30, 2020). This increase between quarters is primarily explained by the increase in gross operating margin due to higher gold production.\nDuring Q2-2021, total cash from operating activities amounted to (-$2.0 million) ($4.8 million for the six-month period ending June 30, 2021) compared to $5.0 million in Q2-2020 ($18.0 million for the six-month period ending June 30, 2020). Changes in working capital items amounted to (-$5.3 million) (-$1.6 million for the six-month period ending June 30, 2021) compared to $5.0 million) in 2020 ($14.9 million for the six-month period ending June 30, 2020). The variance is mainly attributable to the variance in inventories.\nInvesting activities\nDuring the three-month period ended June 30, 2021, the Corporation invested $1.1 million (cumulative six-month 2021 of $1.6 million). This amount is comprised of investments at the plant notably in relation to the increase in capacity (+25% throughput level) completed during the second quarter, improvements in production processes and to new vehicles. All investments are financed with internally generated cash-flows.\nFinancing activities\nIn Q2-2021, three monthly dividends totaling CA$0.0167 per share were disbursed for a total consideration of $0.5 million (CA$0.6 million). In Q2-2020, a quarterly dividend was disbursed for a total consideration of $0.4 million (CA$0.6 million).\nDuring the period, 129,107 common shares (cumulative 180,332 common shares in 2021) were repurchased under the Corporation\u2019s normal course issuer bid share buyback program for a total cash consideration of $0.2 million or CA$0.3 million (none in the first half of 2020).\nIn Q2-2021, 167,500 common shares were issued following the exercise by directors of the Corporation of 167,500 purchase options for a total consideration of $0.2 million (CA$0.3 million).\nIn 2021, the corporation made quarterly repayments of lease liabilities for $0.06 million ($0.15 million per quarter in 2020).\nWorking capital and liquidity\nAs at June 30, 2021, the Corporation\u2019s working capital amounted to $28.9 million, including $13.4 million in cash ($25.4 million, including $11.9 million in cash at December 31, 2020).\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nAs at June 30, 2021, total assets amounted to $83.4 million ($76.3 million as at December 31, 2020). Major variances since last year-end come from the significant increase in cash and in inventories and the impact of the additional deferred tax liability recorded 2021.\n(in $'000) (unaudited)\nAs at June 30,\nAs at December 31,\n2021\n2020\nCash\n13,446\n11,868\nAccounts receivable\n8,858\n8,434\nInventories\n17,127\n13,401\nProperty, plant and equipment\n20,238\n19,677\nRight-of-use assets\n1,143\n834\nExploration and evaluation assets\n18,526\n18,510\nOther assets\n4,027\n3,572\nTotal assets\n83,365\n76,296\nTrade and other payables\n9,721\n7,082\nAsset retirement obligations\n3,585\n3,604\nCurrent tax liabilities\n1,275\n1,124\nDeferred tax liabilities\n1,574\n1,036\nLease liabilities\n1,122\n706\nShareholders' equity\n66,088\n62,744\nTotal liabilities and equity\n83,365\n76,296\nOUTLOOK 2021\nOre processing\nThe Corporation continues to achieve strong levels of ore purchase which permitted the processing of high tonnage of ore during the period.\nThe Corporation recently announced the completion of the expansion project of its Veta Dorada processing plant which has enabled the increase of the throughput level from 345 tpd to 430 tpd, an increase of 25%.\nFor 2021, the Corporation issued financial and capital expenditure guidance(1), forecasting $150 million in sales and a net income of $6.9 million (US$0.18 per share). With sales of $83.7 million as at June 30, 2021 (82.5% of 2020 total sales) and a cumulative net income of $4.3 million or US$0.11 per share (similar to 2020 total numbers), the Corporation is still ahead of its 2021 financial guidance and in a good position to surpass it.\n(1) Assumptions\ni) average CA/US exchange rate of 1.273:1\nii) 2021 financial guidance is based on an average gold price of US$ 1,850 per ounce (Year-end 2020 rate).\nABOUTDYNACOR\nDynacor is a dividend-paying industrial gold ore processor headquartered in Montreal, Canada.

The bulk of the mineralization is located in the lower mine area, which will be accessed through a single portal north of the deposit. The upper mine will be accessed through two shallow shafts located north and south of the mineralization. The mine capacity is 800,000 tonnes per annum with a total of 8.7 million tonnes of ore produced during the 13-year mine life.\nThe ore to be processed is classified into two main categories: regular ore and a pyrite ore with a flowsheet reconfiguration when processing pyrite ore to maximize gold recovery. Ore processing contemplates a single stage crush, milling, a bulk flotation concentrate, regrind through a secondary milling and a secondary flotation, ultimately producing a saleable copper concentrate and a saleable pyrite concentrate. The concentrates will be transported to a port located on the Black Sea in Turkey for shipment to smelting facilities.\nInfrastructure & Capital Costs\nThe majority of the proposed project infrastructure, including the process plant, paste plant, water treatment facility, transformer station and mining offices, will be located in the Maden Valley near the deposit. The tailings facility, mining waste dump, and quarry will be located to the north in the Salicor Valley. A tunnel will be constructed to connect the Maden Valley to the Salicor Valley. Grid power is available on site and some workforce can be based out of Artvin city nearby.\nThe upfront capital cost estimate of $309 million includes a contingency of $31 million.\nUS$ Million | |\nMining Predevelopment Costs | $63 |\nMining Surface Infrastructure | 2 |\nOther Site Infrastructure | 78 |\nProcess Plant Infrastructure | 56 |\nEPCM Fees, Indirect Costs & Construction Facilities | 37 |\nOwners' Costs | 42 |\nProject Contingency | 31 |\nTotal Upfront Capital Expenditure | $309 |\nEconomics\nThe post-tax NPV of $1.05 billion, using a 5% discount rate, has an IRR of 36% and payback period of 2 years.

With respect to the Hod Maden project, these measures include (i) all-in sustaining cost (\"AISC\") per gold ounce on a co-product basis and AISC per gold ounce on a by-product basis, (ii) C1 costs on a by-product basis, and (iii) attributable gold equivalent ounce. As Sandstorm's operations are primarily focused on precious metals, the Company presents these measures as it believes that certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance in comparison to other mining companies in the precious metals mining industry who present results on a similar basis. Other companies may calculate these measures differently as a result of differences in the underlying accounting principles, policies applied and in accounting frameworks, such as in IFRS. The presentation of these measures is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. | ||\n1) | With respect to the Hod Maden project, AISC has been calculated on a co-product basis for gold and copper. The calculation for each metal is based on adding costs specific to each metal to costs allocated to each metal on a proportionate value basis. For gold, AISC per gold ounce on a co-product basis is calculated by summing certain costs (operating costs, royalties, treatment, refining & transport costs, sustaining capital depreciation, G&A, and other costs) associated with the gold produced. The resulting figure is then divided by the payable gold ounces produced.

These standards differ significantly from the mineral reserve disclosure requirements of the United States Securities Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") set forth in Industry Guide 7. Consequently, information regarding mineralization contained or referenced herein is not comparable to similar information that would generally be disclosed by U.S. companies under Industry Guide 7 in accordance with the rules of the SEC. Further, the SEC has adopted amendments to its disclosure rules to modernize the mineral property disclosure requirements for issuers whose securities are registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"). These amendments became effective February 25, 2019 (the \"SEC Modernization Rules\") and, commencing for registrants with their first fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2021, the SEC Modernization Rules replaced the historical property disclosure requirements included in SEC Industry Guide 7. As a foreign private issuer that files its annual report on Form 40-F with the SEC pursuant to the multi-jurisdictional disclosure system, the Company is not required to provide disclosure on its mineral properties under the SEC Modernization Rules and will continue to provide disclosure under NI 43-101 and the CIM Definition Standards. The SEC Modernization Rules include the adoption of terms describing mineral reserves and mineral resources that are \"substantially similar\" to the corresponding terms under the CIM Definition, but there are differences in the definitions under the SEC Modernization Rules and the CIM Definition Standards. Accordingly, there is no assurance any mineral reserves or mineral resources that the Company may report as \"proven mineral reserves\", \"probable mineral reserves\", \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources\" under NI 43-101 would be the same had the Company prepared the mineral reserve or mineral resource estimates under the standards adopted under the SEC Modernization Rules. U.S. investors are also cautioned that while the SEC recognizes \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources\" under the Modernization Rules, investors should not assume that any part or all of the mineralization in these categories will ever be converted into a higher category of mineral resources or into mineral reserves. Mineralization described using these terms has a greater amount of uncertainty as to its existence and feasibility than mineralization that has been characterized as reserves. Accordingly, investors are cautioned not to assume that any measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources, or inferred mineral resources that the Company reports are or will be economically or legally mineable. Further, \"inferred mineral resources\" have a greater amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined legally or economically. Therefore, U.S. investors are also cautioned not to assume that all or any part of the \"inferred mineral resources\" exist. Under Canadian securities laws, estimates of \"inferred mineral resources\" may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases. For the above reasons, information contained or referenced herein regarding descriptions of our mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates is not comparable to similar information made public by U.S. companies subject to reporting and disclosure requirements of the SEC under either Industry Guide 7 or SEC Modernization Rules.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\", within the meaning of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation, concerning the business, operations and financial performance and condition of Sandstorm Gold Royalties. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the future price of gold, silver, copper, iron ore and other metals, the estimation of mineral reserves and resources, realization of mineral reserve estimates, capital expenditures, the timing of development of the Hod Maden Project, the timing and amount of estimated future production, including the increases to production guidance, the offer and sale of Common Shares under the at-the-market equity program (the \"ATM Program\"), including the timing and amounts thereof, the use of any proceeds from the ATM Program, and statements with respect to the Company's proposed normal course issuer bid (\"NCIB\") and the number of Common Shares that may be purchased under the NCIB. Forward-looking statements can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \"may\", \"will\", \"expect\", \"intend\", \"estimate\", \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"continue\", \"plans\", or similar terminology.\nForward-looking statements are made based upon certain assumptions and other important factors that, if untrue, could cause the actual results, performances or achievements of Sandstorm Gold Royalties to be materially different from future results, performances or achievements expressed or implied by such statements. Such statements and information are based on numerous assumptions regarding present and future business strategies and the environment in which Sandstorm Gold Royalties will operate in the future, including the receipt of all required approvals, the price of gold and copper and anticipated costs. Certain important factors that could cause actual results, performances or achievements to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, amongst others, failure to receive necessary approvals, changes in business plans and strategies, market conditions, share price, best use of available cash, gold and other commodity price volatility, discrepancies between actual and estimated production, mineral reserves and resources and metallurgical recoveries, mining operational and development risks relating to the parties which produce the gold or other commodity the Company will purchase, regulatory restrictions, activities by governmental authorities (including changes in taxation), currency fluctuations, the global economic climate, dilution, share price volatility and competition.\nForward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause the actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, including but not limited to: the impact of general business and economic conditions, the absence of control over mining operations from which the Company will purchase gold, other commodities or receive royalties from, and risks related to those mining operations, including risks related to international operations, government and environmental regulation, actual results of current exploration activities, conclusions of economic evaluations and changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined, risks in the marketability of minerals, fluctuations in the price of gold and other commodities, fluctuation in foreign exchange rates and interest rates, stock market volatility, as well as those factors discussed in the section entitled \"Risks to Sandstorm\" in the Company's annual report for the financial year ended December 31, 2020 and the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" contained in the Company's annual information form dated March 30, 2021 available at www.sedar.com. Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that are contained or incorporated by reference, except in accordance with applicable securities laws.\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sandstorm-gold-royalties-announces-results-from-hod-maden-feasibility-study-reaffirms-strong-project-economics-with-1-05-billion-post-tax-npv5-301431206.html\nSOURCE Sandstorm Gold Ltd.",

In 2020 it was 257. But in January of 2021 alone 108 thefts were reported, according the local ABC News affiliate.\nIn one incident in the city in February, 14 catalytic converters were stolen in about an hour when thieves hit a vehicle fleet, causing more than $20,000 in damage.\nOther cities, such as S. Louis and Wichtia, Kansas, are reporting similarly steep spikes, according to a recent New York Times report.\nWhy are catalytic converters in demand?\nA catalytic converter has been installed between the engine and muffler of just about every car and truck sold in the U.S. since the mid-1970s.\nInside, they\u2019re coated with precious metals like platinum, rhodium and palladium, which clean toxic pollutants from the vehicle\u2019s exhaust.\nAs emissions rules become increasingly strict around the globe, especially in China, demand for the materials used in catalytic converters has also skyrocketed.\nAs a result, the materials found in catalytic converters are, quite literally, more valuable than gold. The price of rhodium, one of the precious metals found in catalytic converters, has soared from less than $650 an ounce around 2015 to almost $22,000 an ounce in 2021. That\u2019s more than 10 times the price of gold.\nOn an average car, a converter can cost up to $2,000 to replace or more, depending on the make and model.\nAnd, unfortunately for car owners, catalytic converters aren\u2019t difficult to steal. A single person armed with only a hacksaw and a jack can easily slide under a vehicle and cut off the target device in mere minutes. With larger vehicles like trucks and SUVs, which sit higher off the ground, the jack isn\u2019t even necessary.",

Investors have always cited gold as a safe haven when market uncertainties intensify, and the events in 2020 further confirmed the established correlation between gold and market risk levels.\nSince January 2020, the gold price has zipped up 25% by the end of the year, even hitting a record high of over $2,000 per ounce at one point for the first time in history.\nAlong with the growth of demand for gold-related investments, supply grows too. A Dubai-based precious metal supplier known as Motiwala caught sight of the growth in demand and is determined to make use of this opportunity to become a world leader in the precious metal industry.\nHow Motiwala accumulated sand grain into mountain\nMotiwala Jewellers LLC is a certified precious metal refinery, gold processor, bullion manufacturer, and precious metal supplier based in Dubai. Renowned for its complete and diversified rare metal business network, Motiwala Jewellers is one of the top 5 gold merchants globally and one of the largest refineries in the Middle East region.\nBut Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day. It takes a lot of passion and hard work to build such a spectacular precious metal empire. Its founder, Iqbal Bhai from Pakistan, founded Motiwala 40 years ago and has been in the gold industry since then. He started as a gold and jewellery wholesaler in his home country and later found success when he filed a patent for the international gold market fair in Dubai after discovering its undeveloped gold market.\nThrough several decades of development, Motiwala Jewellers established subsidiary companies to further diversify the range of services it provides and as an effort to complete its supply chain. It is now the holding company of Motiwala Gold Trading, Motiwala Gold & Precious Stone Industry, Motiwala Gold & Metal Laboratory, Shaheen Exchange.\nSince then, the company\u2019s businesses have expanded to cover gold mining, processing, jewellery design, jewellery retail stores, physical gold trading, gold and metal laboratories, precious stones & diamond retail stores, and currency exchange.\nWith its refinery and an ISO 17025 certified in-house laboratory, Motiwala can produce gold bullion at the finest quality and allow investors to purchase gold bars ranging from 1 gram to 100 grams in size at a competitive price in its physical stores, thus allowing all investors to start investing in gold regardless of their capital size.\nSoutheast Asia has a bright future as a digital gold haven\nThe gold market in Asia, Southeast Asia in particular, are underdeveloped, but experts are confident that Southeast Asia has a bright future as a digital gold haven in the near future as Southeast Asia has one of the fastest rates of digital payment adoption and more than 400 million internet users. The strong tech foundations were laid by the appealing regulatory landscape and strong government support that has escalated the growth of innovation and healthy competition in this region.\nIn response to the year-long pandemic crisis, part of the gold and jewellery retailers in Asia are moving their retail businesses onto the internet to reach online consumers and combat the highly contagious virus simultaneously. With robust governance and regulations, digital gold has been gaining much traction in the Southeast Asia market.\nTapping into Southeast Asia\u2019s growing digital gold landscape\nEnvisioned to become the world leader for dealers and traders from across the globe and to achieve sustainable quality growth, Motiwala co-founded Moti Investment Capital (MIC) in 2018 to expand its global presence in the capital trading sector. The establishment of MIC will enable investors to achieve low-risk, sustainable returns using Motiwala\u2019s unique set of the gold supply chain.\nAs the first step to globalize its operation, Motiwala has tapped into Southeast Asian countries, providing a wide array of services to the new countries, including asset management, physical gold trading and more. With Motiwala\u2019s supply chain and diverse line of services, it will allow investors to purchase physical gold even if the investors are located outside of Dubai.\nIn 2018, member countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) had consumed 309 tonnes of gold, making Southeast Asia the third-largest market for gold in the world. With the combination of rapid digital adoption, the cultural importance of gold in the region, and low expansion costs, it makes Southeast Asia an ideal region as the first step in Motiwala\u2019s globalization.\nMOTIWALA announces partnership with BIS\nMotiwala has recently announced its partnership with BIS to expand its global presence. BIS Holding is the first of its kind asset management firm to provide unique investment opportunities for investors, allowing clients to have the privilege to participate in the markets like a real corporate level liquidity provider.\n\u201cWe are excited to partner with BIS,\u201d said Iqbal Bhai, Founder of Motiwala group. \u201cThrough this strategic partnership, Motiwala and BIS can form a clear win-win relationship to provide more value to your existing customers. It would also bolster the long-term partnership between Motiwala and BIS as both firms continue to seek opportunities to achieve business expansion.\u201d\nThis news has been published for the above source.

Hole depths ranged from 40 to 160 metres and were located outside of the current resource areas.\n-\nA total of 349 AC holes were completed for 10,484 metres focusing on high quality structural targets defined from geophysical surveys in areas of shallow cover.\n-\nThe Munro Bore mineralized structure has an extension into Monument\u2019s tenement (\u201cMunro Bore Extension\u201d).\n-\nGeological mapping and interpretation of the completed drilling is in progress, and subject to results obtained, follow up drill programs will be planned.\n-\nAll of the samples generated from the drilling have been delivered to ALS Geochemistry, Perth, and results are expected to be received between October and November 2021.\n-\nA drill program consisting of over 5,500 metres of combined RC and diamond drilling (\u201cDD\u201d) targeting beneath open pits along the high-grade North of Alliance (\u201cNOA\u201d) structure is at an advanced planning stage and selection of a drill contractor is in progress.\nMonument commenced its Phase 1 AC and RC drill program on July 3rd 2021 (as announced on July 20th 2021) and completed it by August 21st 2021 (Figure 1).\nThis first phase of drilling was designed to test new high quality structural targets beneath cover for potential mineralization that may lead to the identification of shallow stand alone or satellite gold deposits to supplement the current resource base. In addition, the drilling tested the strike continuation at Munro Bore Extension that is adjacent to Munro Bore (not owned by Monument). Munro Bore has estimated historical resources of 266,000t at 1.6g/t Au (reported in \u201cTechnical Project Review and Independent Valuation Report (Short Form)\u201d prepared by Giralia Resources NL and reviewed by Ravensgate Mining Industry Consultants in January 2011).\nA total of 46 RC holes for 3,465m were completed against a plan of 12 holes for 1,260m, comprised of 1,301m for the planned Munro Bore Extension and additional 2,164m for the FLC2 and FLC3 prospects that was originally planned in the phase two. It was brought forward to take advantage of increased drill rig availability.\nA total of 349 AC holes were completed for 10,484m at the Authaal East, Burnakura South and Junction targets against a plan of 430 AC holes for 16,680m at Munro Bore Extension, Banderol South and Junction. The targets were tested as planned except the eastern line of the Junction target was not drilled due to steep terrain. The depth to blade refusal was generally less than anticipated resulting in fewer metres drilled than originally planned. Drill holes were angled at 60 degrees and generally spaced at 25m with lines spaced at between 400m to 950m.\nFigure 1 is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/4f5e7d03-ad4f-47d4-ad54-556b158b3923\nDrill holes generally intersected lithology consistent with available mapping and included volcanic and Banded Iron Formation (\u201cBIF\u201d) sequences which are the same lithologies that host the Alliance Mineral Resource. In addition, the continuation of the Munro Bore mineralization could be identified by a zone of shearing, alteration, pyrite mineralization and quartz veining.\nAll samples have been dispatched from site and have been received by ALS Geochemistry, Perth. Due to the backlog for gold assays and multi-element geochemical results which the mining industry is currently experiencing, results aren\u2019t expected to be received until October through to the end of November. Higher priority samples have been prioritized with the lab.\nGeological interpretation of the completed Phase 1 drilling is ongoing and follow up mapping and sampling of some of the drill lines will be planned. Interpretations will be reviewed and refined once assays are received to improve understanding of the geological controls of the mineralized zones and guide phase 2 drilling program on Burnakura, which will be announced accordingly.\nA full review of all historical maps and reports is planned to be completed for the Gabanintha project. An initial review indicated there is a substantial amount of information that needs to be collated before regional exploration programs can be designed. Additional pit mapping and a structural interpretation of the main Gabanintha pit area will also be completed to assist in drill hole targeting underneath the existing pits.\nMunro Bore Extension Target\nA total of 12 holes for 1,301m of RC were drilled at the Munro Bore Extension target (Figure 2). Three lines of drilling were completed with holes spaced between 40m and 50m to extend the tested mineralised strike length 160m, into Monument\u2019s M51/178 tenement. Holes were drilled to depths from 60m to 160m.\nAn historical Mineral Resource at Munro Bore was reported by Giralia Resources in 2010, estimated to be 266,000t at 1.6g/t Au. The drilling confirmed the strike continuation of this structure at a south-west orientation directly into Monument\u2019s M51/178 tenement. No significant drilling or evaluation of this structure within M51/178 has been previously completed.\nThe drilled structure is dipping to the north-east and is over 20m wide, defined by shearing, alteration, pyrite mineralization and quartz veining. There is no indication whether economic mineralization continues along this structure into Monument\u2019s tenement at this stage.\nFigure 2 is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/ef9379be-3d59-451f-93fe-55752a94b693\nFLC2 and FLC3 Prospects\nThe FLC2 and FLC3 targets were added to the Phase 1 drill program to take advantage of increased drill rig availability. A total of 31 holes for 1,882m were completed at the FLC2 prospect (Figure 3) and 4 holes for 282m were completed at the FLC3 prospect (Figure 4). Holes were drilled to depths between 40m and 95m.\nThe FLC2 target is located approximately 400m to the south of the Banderol pit and appears to be associated with the southward continuation of the same structural contact that hosts the mineralization within the pit. The Banderol pit produced an estimated 28koz ounces of gold at 2.9g/t pre-2005 (\u201cUpdated Mineral Resource, Burnakura Project, Western Australia, Australia NI 43-101 Technical Report\u201d prepared by SRK, July 2018, or \u201cJuly 2018 NI43-101 Technical Report\u201d).\nIn addition to this main north-south trending structure, there appears to be structures orientated in a north-easterly direction, which were also targeted by this drill program.\nThe FLC2 target has been previously tested with fences of RAB drilling and several shallow RC holes that identified numerous areas of low-grade gold mineralization as well as some higher grade zones with best intersections of 10m at 3.4g/t from hole FCPH1635 and 3m at 5.0g/t from FCPH1871. This drill program has tested beneath the higher grade intersections into fresh rock, and will increase the understanding of the main controls on mineralization. The mineralization generally appears to be associated with mafic and ultramafic contacts.\nFigure 3 is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/8c878603-8cc0-44a3-8213-6393de3dfb4d\nThe FLC3 prospect is located approximately 1km to the south of the Federal City deposit and is interpreted to occur on the southward continuation of the same structure that hosts the mineralization there. The Federal City pit produced an estimated 1.2koz at 1.3g/t pre-2005 (July 2018 NI43-101 Technical Report). The FLC3 prospect contains several shallow high-grade gold intercepts that include 10m at 10.9g/t from FCPH1526. The prospect has been previously tested with multiple lines of RAB drilling and several shallow follow up RC holes that have not been further tested at depth. The mineralization appears to be trending in a north-south orientation which is subparallel to lithology and magnetic highs. The lithology consists of ultramafic and mafics.\nFigure 4 is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/e499cd08-0e12-4a0f-9a2c-da774c43d3ba\nThe four RC holes that were drilled were designed to test for mineralisation along strike and at depth and to confirm the orientation of the high-grade mineralisation. The holes intersected an ultramafic sequence containing a narrow interval of basalt that has increased deformation and alteration at some of its contacts, which may indicate the mineralization is focused along lithological contacts.\nA full listing of historical drill hole details showing intersections above 1 g/t gold for FLC2 and FLC3 and accompanying drill collar plans are shown in Appendix 1.\nAuthaal East, Banderol South and Junction Targets\nThe Authaal East, Banderol South and Junction Targets had not been previously drilled and are high quality structural targets defined from geophysical surveys, in areas of shallow cover.\nA total of 30 holes for 1,172m were completed at the Authaal East target which is located approximately 500m to the east of the Authaal pits (Figure 5). The Authaal pit has produced an estimated 13koz of gold at 5.7g/t and the Authaal North pit has produced an estimated 7.1koz at 2.9g/t pre-2005 (July 2018 NI43-101 Technical Report). This drill target was added to the drill plan after the July 20th 2021 press release.\nThe Authaal East target\nThe Authaal East target is located at the northern end of a north-south trending magnetic feature adjacent the Burnakura Shear Zone (\u201cBSZ\u201d). Deposits including Banderol and Federal City are located on north-south trending magnetic features that have been interpreted to be dilational subsidiary structures to the BSZ. There is also an existing line of drilling 320m to the north-east of the completed drilling that have 4 holes ending in assay values greater than 0.1 g/t.\nFigure 5 is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/e9eef74a-c218-4ce8-a351-cceb8a5bc767\nBanderol South and Junction Targets\nA total of 127 AC holes for 3,465m of drilling were completed at the Banderol South target. A reinterpretation of the detailed aeromagnetic data identified a secondary north-south structural splay deviating off the regional north-east BSZ. The orientation of this splay coincides with the structural orientation of mineralized quartz veins within the Banderol open pit and is interpreted to be a continuation of the same structure.\nA sequence dominated by felsic volcanics was intersected with minor granodiorite, mafics and ultramafics. Transported cover was generally shallow and less than 1m thick.\nA total of 192 holes for 5,847m of AC drilling were completed at the Junction target. The Junction target occurs at the intersection of a known mineralized north-east structural zone with a north-south structure, where an east-west trending magnetic high is observed. As the greenstone lithologies approach the east-west trending magnetic high to the south and approach two granodiorite bodies, they are interpreted to be dragged and deformed potentially creating extensional dilatational zones within the favorable host lithologies.\nThe drilling at the Junction target intercepted narrow intervals of amphibolite, mafic, ultramafic and possible BIF horizons that are generally less than 100m wide, within a weak to moderately strained granite. Alluvial material covered the whole target area to an average depth of 8m, providing potential to discover hidden mineralization.\nThe eastern most planned line was not drilled due to steep topography that would make drill rig access difficult. This area will be further investigated and could potentially be tested by a soil sampling program.\nQuality Assurance/Quality Control\nAll drilling completed by Monument utilized the following procedures and methodologies and was carried out under the supervision of Monument personnel. The drilling was carried out by Strike Drilling Pty Ltd under the supervision of Monument\u2019s personnel.\nRC drilling used a 5.0-inch face sampling pneumatic hammer with samples collected into 60 litre plastic bags. Samples were collected as 1m splits from the cyclone or as 4m composites from the 60 litre plastic bags. Samples were kept dry by maintaining enough air pressure to exclude groundwater inflow; however, a very small number of RC samples from this drill program were moist or wet.\nAC drilling used a 4.0-inch blade and cuttings were collected in one metre intervals and split between a calico bag and a portion was placed onto the ground for spear sampling 4m composites. The 1m calico samples have been stored at the drill site until assay results are received and validated. Composites returning greater than 0.1g/t Au will be subsampled using the 1m calico bags.\nCoarse reject samples for all mineralized samples corresponding to significant Au intervals will be retained and stored on-site at the Company controlled core yard.\nAll drill samples were shipped to ALS Geochemistry laboratory in Wangara, WA for preparation. Sample analysis may take place at some of ALS\u2019s analysis laboratories outside of Western Australia. All samples will undergo routine gold analysis using a 50-gram charge and fire assay with an atomic absorption finish. Selected samples will be dissolved by a four acid digestion and then analyzed for a suite of 33 elements using an ICP-AES finish.\nQuality control procedures included the systematic insertion of blanks (1 in 50 samples), duplicates (1 in 40 samples) and sample standards (1 in 20 samples) into the sample stream at the drill site.\nThe scientific and technical information in this press release has been assembled by Adrian Woodfield, Chief Geologist of the Company, reviewed and approved by Roger Stangler, MEng, FAusIMM, MAIG, a Qualified Person as defined by NI43-101, retained by Golder Associates Pty Ltd.\nBackground of Murchison Gold Project\nMonument Mining Limited holds a 100% interest in the Murchison Gold Project comprising 170km2 of highly prospective Archean Greenstone terrane located approximately 750km north of Perth and 40km southeast of Meekatharra in Western Australia (Figure 1). The project area covers the eastern margin of the Meekatharra-Wydgee greenstone belt within the north-eastern Murchison domain.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211014005177/en/\nGolden Hope Project: Kracken Pegmatite Swarm Sampling and Proposed Drone Survey\nThe Alliance also received further assays from a second phase of sampling collected from a till covered area, west of the original discovery, with samples of sub-crops and large local boulders returning anomalous results of rubidium, tantalum and lithium. One sample of a large, angular, purple pegmatite boulder located 600 m west of the original lithium zone graded 1.04% Li2O. The sampling has demonstrated that the dyke system contains economic grades of lithium, is widespread, and open along strike.\nThe Alliance is planning detailed geological mapping and a high-resolution drone survey that will include imagery, lidar and magnetic datasets to assist in the mapping and targeting the dyke system for drilling which will commence shortly. The companies have already completed a 5,709 line-km Heliborne High-Resolution Aeromagnetic & Matrix Digital VLF-EM Survey flown by Terraquest Ltd. with the final data currently being processed. The survey will provide the structural / lithological setting and help identify gold-bearing structure extensions, as well as any unrecognized structures including those potentially related to the lithium-bearing pegmatites.\nBenton\u2019s President and CEO, Stephen Stares, states: \"The Alliance has discovered and released high-grade results up to 2.37% Li2O which is the first of its kind in Newfoundland. As the Alliance continues to advance the lithium potential, it\u2019s quickly becoming evident that the Kraken dyke system is a large, highly-evolved, pegmatite field similar to the geological environment and setting of other large systems in the Appalachian belt, including the important deposits held by Piedmont Lithium Inc in the Carolinas, eastern US, as well as in the geologically equivalent Avalonia Project being advanced by Ganfeng Lithium in the Caledonides of Ireland.\"\nQP\nThis news release has been reviewed and approved by Timothy Froude, P.Geo., President and CEO of Sokoman Minerals Corp., and Nathan Sims, P.Geo., Senior Exploration Manager for Benton Resources Inc., both the 'Qualified Person' under National Instrument 43-101.\nCOVID-19 Protocols\nTo ensure a working environment that protects the health and safety of the staff and contractors, Sokoman and Benton are operating under federally and provincially mandated and recommended guidelines during the current COVID-19 alert level.\nAbout Sokoman Minerals Corp.\nSokoman Minerals Corp. is a discovery-oriented company with projects in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.

Visible inspection of core indicates that quartz-calcite-sulphide veins and breccias with strong argillic alteration were intercepted at expected target depths \u2014 confirming continuity of structures hosting veins. By moving the drill rog to San Gill, Zacatecas will be able to test this large north-south trending breccia zones, while waiting for preliminary assay results for the Panuco holes drilled to date.\"\nZacatecas has submitted all mineralized intercepts from the first 6 holes for sample preparation at ALS in Zacatecas. The company implements a robust QAQC program and submits samples in batches of 20 comprising 17 drill core samples, one Geostats certified reference material (a \"standard\"), and one staged duplicate.\nSilver, gold, and base metal mineralization at the Panuco deposit is hosted in breccia veins, banded, crustiform and colloform quartz-calcite veins, and quartz vein stockwork within zones of strong argillic alteration \u2014 as is typical of the intermediate sulphidation veins throughout the Zacatecas region.\nThe Panuco deposit has an historic inferred mineral resource of 19,472,901 ounces Ag Eq. (cut-off 100 g/t Ag Eq.) from 3,954,729 tonnes at 153.2 g/t Ag Eq (136 g/t Ag, 0.14 g/t Au, 0.012% Pb, 0.11% Zn). Mineralization at the Panuco remains open along strike and down dip. See \"Historical Resource Estimate Information\" set forth below.\nSan Gill\nZacatecas plans to carry out exploratory diamond core drilling at the San Gill Breccia located with the Zacatecas Property. The San Gill Breccia is located in the southern part of the main Zacatecas concessions and is approximately 2 kilometres to the southwest of the Veta Grande vein. It is a zone of intense brecciation and quartz veining with an abundant matrix of iron oxides after sulphides. Veins are multiphase \u2014 as evidenced by breccias, quartz vein stockworks, and crustiform and collaform banding.\nThe San Gill Breccia is a robust exploration target that has not been effectively drill tested even though it is 800 metres long and up to 40 metres wide.\nThe technical content of this news release has been reviewed, verified and approved by Dr. Chris Wilson, B.Sc (Hons), PhD, FAusIMM (CP), FSEG. Chief Operating Officer and Director of Zacatecas Silver, a qualified person as defined by NI 43-101.\nOn behalf of the Company\nBryan Slusarchuk\nChief Executive Officer and Director\nHistorical Mineral Resource Estimate Information\nIn 2019 Santacruz Silver Mining Ltd. completed an updated historical resource estimate as set forth in the technical report titled \"Technical Report \u2013 Veta Grande Project, Zacatecas State, Mexico\" dated 20th of August 2019. The report was prepared by Van Phu Bui, P. Geo and Michael O'Brien, P. Geo, and filed on www.sedar.com (\"2019 Panuco Historical Resource\"). The 2019 Panuco Historical Resource reported 3,954,729 tonnes at 153 g/t Ag Eq. (136 g/t Ag, 0.14 g/t Au, 0.012 % Pb, 0.11% Zn) for a total of 19,472,901 ounces Ag Eq. (cut-off 100 g/t Ag Eq.). The 2019 Panuco Historical Resource used \"inferred mineral resources\", which is a category set forth under CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources & Mineral Reserves adopted on May 10, 2014.\nThe 2019 Panuco Historical Resource was calculating using 75 drill collars, 866 down hole surveys and 2,607 assayed samples. A surface trench database totalling 183 trenches with 1,813 samples was used. Resource blocks were defined using with dimensions of 20 m along strike and down dip, and 1 m across strike. Grades for gold, silver, lead and zinc were interpolated into blocks using the following estimation algorithms: central \u2014 ordinary kriging and NW and Tres Cruces \u2014 inverse distance squared. Assumptions used in the 2019 Panuco Historical Resource include the following metal prices: gold price of US $1,350/oz, silver price of US $16/oz, lead price of US $0.90/lb and zinc price of US $1.10/lb. The 2019 Panuco Historical Resource assumed recovering similar to the Veta Grande System being: gold at 52.2%, silver at 62.1%, lead at 87.9% and zinc at 78.6%. The Company considers the 2019 Panuco Historical Resource relevant due to its identification and modelling of the Panuco deposit.\nThe Company has not done sufficient work to classify the 2019 Panuco Historical Resource as a current mineral resource or mineral reserves, and the Company is not treating the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. Although the historical resource estimate is considered reliable, 8% of the drill core intervals used in the resource calculations was re-sampled and submitted these to ALS for independent assay. Further, additional data verification including resurveying of select diamond drill holes collars; review of graphic drill core logs, comparison of these logs with remaining half-cut core, and a cross-check of select geological logs agonist database entries; and a check of original ALS assay certificates against the assays and drill hole database. Remodelling of the current Panuco resource is ongoing pending receipt of check sample assays.\nForward-Looking Statements\nInformation set forth in this news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on assumptions as of the date of this news release.

(TSXV: TEM) (\"Tembo\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to provide this update on recent activities and the status of the Company, highlighting the planned imminent restart of exploration activities at its Tembo Gold Project in the highly prolific Lake Victoria Goldfield in northern Tanzania.\nHighlights\nRestarting Exploration - After a care and maintenance period of seven years, Tembo Gold is about to relaunch its exploration programme on the Tembo Project. Tembo is making preparations in the field to be ready to restart with a 7,000m drill program in October with the objective to discover, delineate and determine a maiden gold resource, building on the very positive results of several previous drill programs where almost 50,000m was drilled.\nStrategically Located - The Tembo Gold Project is highly prospective, and, importantly, is strategically located next to one of the worlds largest high grade gold deposits, Barrick Gold Corp's +20M oz Au (mined to date and in resource) Bulyanhulu Mine, in the Lake Victoria goldfield of Tanzania (Figure 1). The Company has consolidated and expanded its prospecting area adjacent to Bulyanhulu and now covers an area of 174km2, an area which hosts the continuation of the geology of the Bulyanhulu deposit.\n54 New Drill Targets - Using their proprietary AI (Artificial Intelligence) technology, Goldspot Technologies have generated 54 new drill targets for Tembo on its licences for follow up exploration. Tembo plans to explore these in addition to the three core targets defined by previous drilling.\nRecapitalized, with a Strong Team - The Company is debt free and has just completed a C$2.3m equity capital raise. It has a clean, tightly held shareholding, closely aligned executive management and shareholder goals, a highly experienced board of directors and executive management team, a newly appointed strategic advisory board and technical advisory group with extensive corporate and technical experience.\nImproved Investment Climate - In Tanzania, the investment climate generally, and for mining particularly, has recently improved significantly and is expected to see several major mine construction project developments commence soon, and be strongly supported by the government, as the financial benefit to the government treasury, communities and individuals is realised.\nDavid Scott, President & CEO, stated \"Through the persistence and commitment of our Tanzanian and corporate Canadian executive team, Tembo has managed to retain and expand its license holdings in what is one of the most prospective areas of greenstone geology I have seen in my 20+ years as a geologist working in Tanzania. Our corporate status in both Tanzania and Canada has been preserved and with the improvement of the investment climate in Tanzania and the gold market, it is now possible to remobilize and complete the exploration work on this project. This is the opportunity that the supportive shareholders of the company have persevered to retain and now is the time to realize the value for all stakeholders.\"\nExploration Programme\nEarlier drill programmes undertaken by Tembo returned excellent results, including high grade and wide gold mineralization that could not be further developed at the time due to the almost total withdrawal of exploration investment from Tanzania, particularly in the goldfield. At the three primary targets of these drilling campaigns, Ngula 1, Nyakagwe Village and Nyakagwe East, previous drilling highlights included:\nNgula 1:\nTDD0004: 3.13 g/t Au over 25.89m from 41.00m\nTDD0041: 22.81g/t Au over 15.00m from 299.00m\nTDD0054: 8.17g/t over 11.05m from 116.95m\nNyakagwe Village :\nTDD0071: 9.64g/t Au over 3.95 m from 85.25m\nTDD0101: 78.1g/t Au over 1.00m from 294m;\nTDD0107: 16.58g/t Au over 3.55m from 43.88m\nTDD0111: 35.14g/t Au over 2.45m from 53.35m;\nTRC0552: 8.42g/t gold over 3.00m from 86m;\nNyakagwe East:\nDD01: 8.09g/t Au over 4.5m from 37.50m\nDD05: 5.99g/t Au over 5.81m from 79.53m\nTDD0074: 6.55g/t Au over 7.46m from 370.46m;\nWith the improvements in the Tanzanian investment climate as well as in the gold price, in addition to the renewal and expansion of its license areas, the Company plans to re-enter the field and begin drilling again by the end of October.\nRecent technical data review and reinterpretation with the application of geological expertise, and machine learning and artificial intelligence software by GoldSpot Discoveries Corp and Tembo personnel has quantified the many targets and prioritised these for the work programmes to follow. The review confirmed and quantified 54 priority targets that, together with the three targets that have already had initial drilling, will be systematically explored commencing immediately.\nPreparations have begun to refurbish the Company field camp, purchase consumable supplies and other equipment, prepare the field vehicles, and inspect and provide access to the field sites where drilling is to be undertaken. Drilling tender quotes have been received and are being considered prior to awarding of the drill contracts and mobilization of drills by the middle to end of October.\nA total drill programme of approximately 7,000m of diamond drilling (36 holes) is planned that will further test previously intersected strong mineralization at the core Ngula 1, Nyakagwe East and Nyakagwe Village targets to define structure and likely plunge of mineralization, and then follow the mineralized zones to depth and along strike. The new drill programme will also test two new targets to be selected from those that have not had previous drilling, as well as commence the testing of new targets arising from the GoldSpot-Tembo data review.\nOn the back of anticipated good results, the Company intends to undertake follow up exploration programmes in late 2021 to early 2022 and to fast track resource development and feasibility studies, which will follow in late 2022 and through 2023 as results dictate. The Company's goal is to discover one or more multimillion-ounce deposits within the current licence area. The high grades and widths intersected to date are an encouraging indication that this may be possible, and through the diligent application of sound geological expertise and exploration methods, Tembo will be seek to achieve this goal.\nFigure 1. The Sukumaland greenstone belt, Lake Victoria goldfield, Tanzania\nThe investment climate in Tanzania has experienced a marked improvement in the past year or so, which has been extremely important as it has resulted in a very significant reversal in the previous decline of the country's mining industry and stimulated major progress in attracting new investment in Tanzania's mining industry. Some key positives include:\nBarrick Gold and the Tanzanian Government have reached a cooperative settlement of previous disputes, significantly improving the government's relationship with mining companies. Also, with the merger of Barrick with Randgold, a strong emphasis on the stabilisation and expansion of production has been expressed by Barrick and initiated at its Tanzanian operations, a vote of confidence in the country's mining industry and exploration potential.\nThe country's new President, Hon. Samia Suhulu Hassan, has since her inauguration, spoken very positively about the need to promote investment, and particularly mining investment, and has further improved the investment climate in Tanzania through other pronouncements including the need for private businesses to be able to manage their investments with the people they need.\nSo far this year, the country has seen a rapid and very large increase in investment projects (up 36.7% compared to 2020 from 68 to 92) and new investment value (up 725% compared to 2020 from US$321M to US$2.65B) in the second quarter of 2021, a clear sign of an improved outlook for investment in the country.\nSignificant investment is being made to provide rural electricity, improve road infrastructure, ensure fresh water supplies to all, all of which will assist in stabilizing the communities and economy and providing logistical and cost benefits to the mining industry.\nSeveral Special Mining Licence and Mining Licence applications, previously pending for considerable time periods, have recently been granted; the government is also signalling that such applications will in future be dealt with promptly.\nThe importance of the potential income to state coffers from mining is appreciated and large proposed new projects such as Kabanga Nickel and Nyanzaga, a multimillion-ounce gold resource being advanced by Orecorp not far from Tembo's licenses, are likely to be developed shortly, further improving the credibility and impact of the industry to the country.\nRenewed and Expanded Licence Holding\nPrior to the care and maintenance shutdown, the result of a general exploration investment flight from Tanzania that affected the entire industry, the Company held 110km2 adjacent to Barrick's Bulyanhulu Mine operation. The Company has renewed all of its licences and also successfully expanded the exploration area to 174km2. The new expanded project area includes the immediate northern extension of the Bulyanhulu Special Mining (SML) Licence geology, host to the multiple subparallel reefs that contain the mine's reserves, an area that was previously held by Barrick, an additional area to the north of that which was previously open, and an area that was formerly the southwest corner of the SML, all significantly increasing the greenstone prospective area of the Company.\nThe expanded project area still incorporates the central, most important, core area which contains the most extensive artisanal workings, and on which Tembo exploration was focused during the 2012-2014 drill campaigns and which returned the outstanding results of those drill programmes.\nQA/QC\nA QA/QC practice is applied to all sample batches. All samples are securely sealed and sample batches bagged for transport to SGS laboratories in Mwanza. A Verified Reference Material standard is inserted every 20th sample, a known blank or blank standard every 20th sample and all samples with assays greater than 0.5 g/t Au are re-assayed. 1% of all samples are submitted to an alternative laboratory for check analysis. In addition the laboratory adheres to an internal QA/QC procedure including standard samples and repeats and blanks inserted independently. The coarse residue and pulps are retained for further analysis and verification.\nThe above information has been prepared under the supervision of David Scott, Pr. Sci. Nat., who is designated as a \"Qualified Person\" with the ability and authority to verify the authenticity and validity of the data.\nNotes to the above drill results:\nWidths represent drill intersection widths not corrected for drill hole inclination and dip of the geological zone. True widths have not been determined.\nDrill holes have not been drilled in numerical sequence and not all drill holes in a sequence have necessarily been drilled. Drill hole numbers represent the original drill hole identification assigned when planned.\nNo capping of high-grade values has been applied to the assay results.\nAbout Tembo Gold Corp.\nTembo is a Canadian publicly listed mineral exploration company (TEM on the TSX Venture Exchange) with a 100% interest in the Tembo Gold Project.

All figures are in US Dollars, unless otherwise expressed.\nQ3 2021 Financial Highlights\nRevenue for Q3 2021 decreased 6% to $40.7 million, compared with $43.5 million in Q3 2020, mainly due to a reduction in the average realized gold price of $1,753/oz. in Q3 2021 as compared to $1,896/oz. for Q3 2020.\nOperating production costs of $19.4 million in Q3 2021 as compared to $14.1M in Q3 2020. The increase in operating cost is primarily due to local inflationary pressure on wages, mining materials and plant consumables, higher tonnes processed and higher secondary development.\nCash operating costs increased 36% to $833 per ounce of gold sold as a result of reduced ounces sold and increased production costs, while All-in Sustaining Costs increased to $1,184 per ounce of gold sold for Q3 2021, compared to $614 and $1,011 respectively per ounce of gold sold for the same period in 2020.\nNet income for Q3 2021 decreased to $11.4 million, compared with $16.5 million in Q3 2020. Major differences were a $2.7 million decline in revenue, $5.3 million increase in operating cost due to production costs increasing, and a $1.9 million increase in depreciation, offset by a foreign exchange gain of $1.9 million, income tax expense reduction of $2 million, and a decrease of $0.9 million in operating expenses.\nFree cash flow was $9.8 million for Q3 2021 based on operating cash flow minus capital expenditures, compared to $14.9 million in Q3 2020. Free cash flow was $423 per ounce sold in Q3 2021 compared to $651 per ounce sold in Q3 2020.\nCash Position and Working Capital\nAs of September 30, 2021, with cash of $38.1 million compared to $34.4 million on June 30, 2021.\nAs of September 30, 2021, working capital was $33 million, compared to $29 million as at December 31, 2020, which includes $3 million in short term loans from Brazilian banks.\nA $3.7M net increase in cash represents (i) $16.4M in cash generated from operating activities, offset by (ii) $10.4M used in investing activities, and (iii) $2.3M cash used in financing activities for dividend payment.\nQ3 2021 Quarterly Dividend\nThe Company is also pleased to announce that its Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of C$0.04 per common share of the Company, to be paid on November 30, 2021, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 23, 2021. This is the same amount as paid in the previous three quarters. The dividend qualifies as an eligible dividend for Canadian income tax purposes.\nThe Board of Directors intends to review, among other things, the Company's budget, cash flow forecast and existing market conditions on a quarterly basis in order to determine whether any additional dividends will be declared on Shares for subsequent quarters.\nVern Baker, President and CEO of Jaguar Mining stated: \"Jaguar completed the third quarter with a strong balance sheet, positive cash flow from both operations, an exploration effort developing new resources both within and outside our current operations, and with the queueing up of several projects with the potential to contribute over the next few years.\nThe disappointing aspect of our quarter was the increase in operating expenses. The main contributing factors to our cost increase were inflation across all components of operating expenditures, an increase of 15% in tonnes mined and milled, and the additional measures for health monitoring, hygiene and distancing made during the pandemic. Inflation is clearly something we will be dealing with for the remainder of this year and into next year. Now that we believe the bulk of the pandemic issues are behind us, Jaguar is working on several initiatives to reduce costs to begin countering inflation and we are looking to begin removing the additional measures taken to combat the pandemic.\nIn 2021 lower head grades have been the key contributor to a weaker AISC per ounce. Efforts to improve the grade of the ore going into our mills began paying off in Q3 as we experienced our best overall grade of the year. Turmalina experienced its best head grade quarter in the last 4 quarters and sees improving statistics on all quality measures. Pilar\u00b4s head grade remained consistent with the reserve grade, and we foresee improvement on quality statistics (dilution, recovery, model reconciliation) as the mine continues on a sustainable path.\nIn Q3 2021 the Jaguar team was able to push all our exploration and growth project work, sustainably develop our mines, pay a dividend, and maintain a strong balance sheet. We are confident we can continue in this manner and utilize our infrastructure and exploration properties to organically grow our production base.\"\nQ3 2021 Financial Results\nQualified Person\nScientific and technical information contained in this press release has been reviewed and approved by Jonathan Victor Hill, BSc (Hons) (Economic Geology - UCT), FAUSIMM, Vice President Geology and Exploration, who is also an employee of Jaguar Mining Inc., and is a \"qualified person\" as defined by National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\").\nThe Iron Quadrangle\nThe Iron Quadrangle has been an area of mineral exploration dating back to the 16th century. The discovery in 1699-1701 of gold contaminated with iron and platinum-group metals in the southeastern corner of the Iron Quadrangle gave rise to the name of the town Ouro Preto (Black Gold). The Iron Quadrangle contains world-class multi-million-ounce gold deposits such as Morro Velho, Cuiab\u00e1, and S\u00e3o Bento. Jaguar holds the Third largest gold land position in the Iron Quadrangle with just over 25,000 hectares.\nAbout Jaguar Mining Inc.\nJaguar Mining Inc. is a Canadian-listed junior gold mining, development, and exploration company operating in Brazil with three gold mining complexes and a large land package with significant upside exploration potential from mineral claims. The Company's principal operating assets are located in the Iron Quadrangle, a prolific greenstone belt in the state of Minas Gerais and include the Turmalina Gold Mine Complex and Caet\u00e9 Mining Complex (Pilar and Ro\u00e7a Grande Mines, and Caet\u00e9 Plant). The Company also owns the Paci\u00eancia Gold Mine Complex, which has been on care and maintenance since 2012. The Ro\u00e7a Grande Mine has been on temporary care and maintenance since April 2019.

Forward-looking statements and information are provided for the purpose of providing information about management's expectations and plans relating to the future. All of the forward-looking information made in this news release is qualified by the cautionary statements below and those made in our other filings with the securities regulators in Canada. Forward-looking information contained in forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \"are expected,\" \"is forecast,\" \"is targeted,\" \"approximately,\" \"plans,\" \"anticipates,\" \"projects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"continue,\" \"estimate,\" \"believe\" or variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results \"may,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"might,\" or \"will\" be taken, occur or be achieved. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, may be considered to be or include forward-looking information. This news release contains forward-looking information regarding, among other things, expected sales, production statistics, ore grades, tonnes milled, recovery rates, cash operating costs, definition/delineation drilling, the timing and amount of estimated future production, costs of production, capital expenditures, costs and timing of the development of projects and new deposits, success of exploration, development and mining activities, currency fluctuations, capital requirements, project studies, mine life extensions, restarting suspended or disrupted operations, continuous improvement initiatives, and resolution of pending litigation. The Company has made numerous assumptions with respect to forward-looking information contained herein, including, among other things, assumptions about the estimated timeline for the development of its mineral properties; the supply and demand for, and the level and volatility of the price of, gold; the accuracy of reserve and resource estimates and the assumptions on which the reserve and resource estimates are based; the receipt of necessary permits; market competition; ongoing relations with employees and impacted communities; political and legal developments in any jurisdiction in which the Company operates being consistent with its current expectations including, without limitation, the impact of any potential power rationing, tailings facility regulation, exploration and mine operating licenses and permits being obtained and renewed and/or there being adverse amendments to mining or other laws in Brazil and any changes to general business and economic conditions. Forward-looking information involves a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including among others: the risk of Jaguar not meeting the forecast plans regarding its operations and financial performance; uncertainties with respect to the price of gold, labour disruptions, mechanical failures, increase in costs, environmental compliance and change in environmental legislation and regulation, weather delays and increased costs or production delays due to natural disasters, power disruptions, procurement and delivery of parts and supplies to the operations; uncertainties inherent to capital markets in general (including the sometimes volatile valuation of securities and an uncertain ability to raise new capital) and other risks inherent to the gold exploration, development and production industry, which, if incorrect, may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by the Company and described herein. In addition, there are risks and hazards associated with the business of gold exploration, development, mining and production, including environmental hazards, tailings dam failures, industrial accidents and workplace safety problems, unusual or unexpected geological formations, pressures, cave-ins, flooding, chemical spills, procurement fraud and gold bullion thefts and losses (and the risk of inadequate insurance, or the inability to obtain insurance, to cover these risks). Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking information.\nFor additional information with respect to these and other factors and assumptions underlying the forward-looking information made in this news release, see the Company's most recent Annual Information Form and Management's Discussion and Analysis, as well as other public disclosure documents that can be accessed under the issuer profile of \"Jaguar Mining Inc.\" on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. The forward-looking information set forth herein reflects the Company's reasonable expectations as at the date of this news release and is subject to change after such date. The Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, other than as required by law. The forward-looking information contained in this news release is expressly qualified by this cautionary statement.\nNon-IFRS Measures\nThis news release provides certain financial measures that do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS. Readers are cautioned to review the below stated footnotes where the Company expands on its use of non-IFRS measures.\nCash operating costs and cash operating cost per ounce are non-IFRS measures. In the gold mining industry, cash operating costs and cash operating costs per ounce are common performance measures but do not have any standardized meaning. Cash operating costs are derived from amounts included in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) and include mine-site operating costs such as mining, processing and administration, as well as royalty expenses, but exclude depreciation, depletion, share-based payment expenses, and reclamation costs. Cash operating costs per ounce are based on ounces produced and are calculated by dividing cash operating costs by commercial gold ounces produced; US$ cash operating costs per ounce produced are derived from the cash operating costs per ounce produced translated using the average Brazilian Central Bank R$/US$ exchange rate. The Company discloses cash operating costs and cash operating costs per ounce, as it believes those measures provide valuable assistance to investors and analysts in evaluating the Company's operational performance and ability to generate cash flow. The most directly comparable measure prepared in accordance with IFRS is total production costs. A reconciliation of cash operating costs per ounce to total production costs for the most recent reporting period, the quarter ended September 30. 2021, is set out in the Company's Third quarter 2020 Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.\nAll-in sustaining cost is a non-IFRS measure. This measure is intended to assist readers in evaluating the total costs of producing gold from current operations. While there is no standardized meaning across the industry for this measure, except for non-cash items the Company's definition conforms to the all-in sustaining cost definition as set out by the World Gold Council in its guidance note dated September 27, 2013. The Company defines all-in sustaining cost as the sum of production costs, sustaining capital (capital required to maintain current operations at existing levels), corporate general and administrative expenses, and in-mine exploration expenses. All-in sustaining cost excludes growth capital, reclamation cost accretion related to current operations, interest and other financing costs, and taxes. A reconciliation of all-in sustaining cost to total production costs for the most recent reporting period, the quarter ended September 30. 2021, is set out in the Company's Third quarter 2021 MD&A filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.",

During the first quarter of 2021, the Company sold 56,727 gold ounces at an average realized price per ounce of $1,761, compared to 40,169 gold ounces sold at an average price per ounce of $1,585 during the same period of 2020. Gold ounces sold for the first quarter of 2021 increased 41% compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to the addition of the gold ounces sold from the Florida Canyon mine and by increases in gold ounces sold at the San Agustin and La Colorada mines. The addition of a Merrill Crowe recovery plant during the fourth quarter of 2020 at San Agustin and higher grades and better than expected recoveries at La Colorada led to higher production and sales, partially offset by a decrease in gold ounces sold at the El Castillo mine as a result of a decrease in grade and changing from crushed to run of mine material during the first quarter of 2020.\nIncome from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2021 was $27.8 million or $0.09 per basic or diluted share compared to a loss from continuing operations of $9.5 million or $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2020. Loss from discontinued operations for the first quarter of 2021 was $0.8 million as a result of the Ana Paula project being classified as a held-for-sale asset as at March 31, 2021 and as a discontinued operation for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Net income for the first quarter of 2021 was $27.0 million or $0.09 per basic or diluted share compared to a net loss of $9.5 million or $0.05 loss per share for the same period in 2020.\nCash flow from operating activities before changes in non-cash operating working capital for the first quarter of 2021 was $27.7 million compared to $14.8 million in the first quarter of 2020. The 88% increase is due to an 11% increase in the average realized gold price, the increase in ounces sold due to the addition of the Florida Canyon mine and the net increase in ounces sold at the three mines in Mexico. During the first quarter of 2021, cash increased by $13.2 million due primarily to $26.3 million of cash flows from operations (including changes in non-cash operating capital and other items), $19.5 million from issuance of flow-through shares and $7.9 million from a private placement with Ausenco Engineering Canada Inc., offset by $38.4 of capital expenditures incurred, as compared to the first quarter of 2020 in which cash increased by $3.0 million due primarily to $18.6 million of cash flows from operations, partially offset by $12.5 million of capital expenditures incurred and the repayment of $3.0 million of debt.\nOperating Results \u2013 First Quarter 2021\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, the Company achieved record quarterly production of 59,704 GEOs at a cash cost per gold ounce sold of $1,003 and an all-in sustaining cost (\"AISC\") per gold ounce sold of $1,313, compared to 41,536 GEOs at a cash cost of $967 per gold ounce sold and an AISC per gold ounce sold of $1,323 during the first quarter of 2020 (see \"Non-IFRS Measures\" section). Higher GEO production is primarily related to the addition of the Florida Canyon mine and increased production at the San Agustin and La Colorada mines. The addition of a Merrill Crowe recovery plant during the fourth quarter of 2020 at San Agustin and higher grades and better than expected recoveries at La Colorada led to higher production, partially offset by a decrease in GEOs produced at the El Castillo mine as a result of a decrease in grade and changing from crushed to run of mine material during the first quarter of 2020.\nHigher cash cost per gold ounce sold and AISC per gold ounce sold was primarily due to the addition of the Florida Canyon mine, which is currently Argonaut's highest cost operation.\nFIRST QUARTER 2021 EL CASTILLO COMPLEX OPERATING STATISTICS\n3 Months Ended March 31 | |||\n2021 | 2020 | % Change | |\nMining (in 000s except waste/ore ratio) | |||\nTonnes ore El Castillo | 2,404 | 1,922 | 25% |\nTonnes ore San Agustin | 2,870 | 2,709 | 6% |\nTonnes ore | 5,274 | 4,631 | 14% |\nTonnes waste El Castillo | 3,137 | 3,414 | (8%) |\nTonnes waste San Agustin | 1,774 | 1,869 | (5%) |\nTonnes waste | 4,911 | 5,283 | (7%) |\nTonnes mined El Castillo | 5,541 | 5,336 | 4% |\nTonnes mined San Agustin | 4,644 | 4,578 | 1% |\nTonnes mined | 10,185 | 9,914 | 3% |\nTonnes per day El Castillo | 62 | 59 | 5% |\nTonnes per day San Agustin | 52 | 50 | 4% |\nTonnes per day | 114 | 109 | 5% |\nWaste/ore ratio El Castillo | 1.30 | 1.78 | (27%) |\nWaste/ore ratio San Agustin | 0.62 | 0.69 | (10%) |\nWaste/ore ratio | 0.93 | 1.14 | (18%) |\nLeach Pads (in 000s) | |||\nTonnes crushed East to leach pads El Castillo | 0 | 214 | (100%) |\nTonnes crushed West to leach pads El Castillo | 0 | 3 | (100%) |\nTonnes direct to leach pads El Castillo | 2,402 | 1,732 | 39% |\nTonnes crushed to leach pads San Agustin | 2,982 | 2,733 | 9% |\nTonnes to leach pads | 5,384 | 4,682 | 15% |\nProduction | |||\nGold grade loaded to leach pads El Castillo (g/t)1 | 0.29 | 0.55 | (47%) |\nGold grade loaded to leach pads San Agustin (g/t)1 | 0.27 | 0.36 | (25%) |\nGold grade loaded to leach pads (g/t)1 | 0.28 | 0.44 | (36%) |\nGold loaded to leach pads El Castillo (oz)2 | 22,176 | 34,471 | (36%) |\nGold loaded to leach pads San Agustin (oz)2 | 25,910 | 31,255 | (17%) |\nGold loaded to leach pads (oz)2 | 48,086 | 65,726 | (27%) |\nProjected recoverable GEOs loaded El Castillo4 | 9,737 | 13,072 | (26%) |\nProjected recoverable GEOs loaded San Agustin4 | 18,889 | 22,781 | (17%) |\nProjected recoverable GEOs loaded4 | 28,626 | 35,853 | (20%) |\nGold produced El Castillo (oz)2,3 | 11,972 | 14,435 | (17%) |\nGold produced San Agustin (oz)2,3 | 17,271 | 12,835 | 35% |\nGold produced (oz)2,3 | 29,243 | 27,270 | 7% |\nSilver produced El Castillo (oz)2,3 | 21,795 | 23,545 | (7%) |\nSilver produced San Agustin (oz)2,3 | 142,431 | 75,504 | 89% |\nSilver produced (oz)2,3 | 164,226 | 99,049 | 66% |\nGEOs produced El Castillo3 | 12,228 | 14,729 | (17%) |\nGEOs produced San Agustin3 | 18,947 | 13,779 | 38% |\nGEOs produced3 | 31,175 | 28,508 | 9% |\nGold sold El Castillo (oz)2 | 13,602 | 13,626 | 0% |\nGold sold San Agustin (oz)2 | 16,666 | 13,461 | 24% |\nGold sold (oz)2 | 30,268 | 27,087 | 11% |\nSilver sold El Castillo (oz)2 | 21,118 | 23,545 | (10%) |\nSilver sold San Agustin (oz)2 | 128,921 | 85,137 | 51% |\nSilver sold (oz)2 | 150,039 | 108,682 | 38% |\nGEOs sold El Castillo | 13,851 | 13,920 | 0% |\nGEOs sold San Agustin | 18,182 | 14,525 | 25% |\nGEOs sold | 32,033 | 28,445 | 13% |\nCash cost per gold ounce sold El Castillo5 | $1,049 | $1,099 | (5%) |\nCash cost per gold ounce sold San Agustin5 | $807 | $782 | 3% |\nCash cost per gold ounce sold5 | $916 | $941 | (3%) |\n1\"g/t\" is grams per tonne. |\n2\"oz\" means troy ounce. |\n3Produced ounces are calculated as ounces loaded to carbon. |\n4Expected recoverable GEOs are based on the assumptions and parameters as set forth in the El Castillo Complex Technical Report dated March 27, 2018.

Higher GEO production was due to a 38% increase in production at the San Agustin mine offset by a 17% decrease in production at the El Castillo mine. Higher GEO production at San Agustin was driven by a 9% increase is crusher throughput and higher metal recoveries associated with a Merrill Crowe recovery plant that was installed during the fourth quarter of 2020. Lower GEO production at El Castillo was primarily due to a 47% reduction in gold grades loaded to the leach pads associated with anticipated recoveries based on ore type and the change from crushed ore to run-of-mine ore, which lowered unit costs and allowed for lower grade ore to become economic. Cash cost per gold ounce sold was relatively in line with the same period of 2020.\nFIRST QUARTER 2021 LA COLORADA OPERATING STATISTICS\n3 Months Ended March 31 | |||\n2021 | 2020 | % Change | |\nMining (in 000s except for waste/ore ratio) | |||\nTonnes ore | 1,227 | 947 | 30% |\nTonnes waste | 4,014 | 4,683 | (14%) |\nTotal tonnes | 5,241 | 5,630 | (7%) |\nTonnes per day | 59 | 62 | (5%) |\nWaste/ore ratio | 3.27 | 4.95 | (34%) |\nLeach Pads (in 000s) | |||\nTonnes crushed to leach pads | 1,266 | 966 | 31% |\nProduction | |||\nGold grade loaded to leach pads (g/t)1 | 0.54 | 0.35 | 54% |\nGold loaded to leach pads (oz)2 | 22,091 | 11,022 | 100% |\nProjected recoverable GEOs loaded4 | 17,634 | 8,431 | 109% |\nGold produced (oz)2,3 | 15,894 | 12,349 | 29% |\nSilver produced (oz)2,3 | 52,912 | 54,315 | (3%) |\nGEOs produced3 | 16,516 | 13,028 | 27% |\nGold sold (oz)2 | 13,630 | 13,082 | 4% |\nSilver sold (oz)2 | 44,438 | 54,198 | (18%) |\nGEOs sold | 14,153 | 13,759 | 3% |\nCash cost per gold ounce sold5 | $765 | $1,021 | (25%) |\n1 \"g/t\" refers to grams per tonne. |\n2 \"oz\" refers to troy ounce. |\n3 Produced ounces are calculated as ounces loaded to carbon. |\n4 Expected recoverable GEOs are based on the assumptions and parameters as set forth in the La Colorada Gold/Silver Mine Technical Report dated March 27, 2018.

Florida Canyon produced 12,013 GEOs at a cash cost of $1,462 per gold ounce sold during the first quarter of 2021 (see \"Non-IFRS Measures\" section).\nArgonaut has identified potentially significant operating cost savings once it can eliminate the re-handle on the back end of the secondary crushing by switching to a conveying and stacking system to transport crushed ore to the leach pads. All necessary regulatory approvals, including a modification to the existing Air Quality permit, to allow for the construction, installation and operation of a new conveying and stacking system have been received (see press release dated April 28, 2021). The equipment associated with the conveying and stacking system has been ordered and/or procured, and it is estimated that the new system will be operational and ramped up to design capacity during the third quarter of 2021. The capital associated with the convey and stack project was included in Argonaut's 2021 capital guidance (see press release dated January 19, 2021).\nPete Dougherty commented: \"All three mines in Mexico are meeting or exceeding our expectations to start the year and delivered strong first quarter results, leading to record quarterly production and revenue. We still have work to do to optimize Florida Canyon and have a plan in place to do so now that the minor modification to our Air Quality permit has been approved, which will allow for the installation of a conveying and stacking system. We believe this will significantly reduce operating costs at Florida Canyon once it is installed and ramped up to design specifications, and we expect to achieve this during the third quarter of 2021. On a consolidated basis, we are on track to meet our 2021 production, cost and capital guidance after a solid first quarter.\"\nMagino Construction Update\nSite preparation and early site earthworks are well underway, and the Magino construction project continues to advance on schedule.

(NYSE American: PZG) announced today it has completed the purchase of 152 unpatented lode claims (~3,100 acres) from South Sleeper Resources LLC. The claims are located only two miles south of Paramount\u2019s wholly-owned former high-grade producing Sleeper Gold Mine.\nWith the acquisition of the South Sleeper claims, Paramount has increased its total land position to over 40,000 acres in the prolific and highly prospective Sleeper district situated at the intersection of two major Nevada mining trends - the Battle Mountain-Eureka and Western Nevada Rift.\nThe claims were formerly owned by several Nevada companies that collectively conducted numerous geophysical surveys and completed a total of 11 drill holes which intersected gold values up to 9.48 g/T over 3.05 meters (10 ft.) in alluvium. These drill results were never properly assessed or followed up.\nParamount CEO, Rachel Goldman commented: \u201cThis acquisition fits with our strategy of consolidating prospective targets near our material projects and applying our significant district knowledge of the geology to develop and execute successful exploration programs.\u201d\nOn the merits of these new claims, Glen van Treek, Paramount President and COO, explained: \u201cThe Sleeper deposit sits on the margins of one of many major structural and lithological occurrences known as a \u2018range front fault\u2019 where several Nevada deposits have been found. In the Sleeper district, this feature, which is found throughout Nevada, is marked by a transition from \u2018high density\u2019 Jurassic-Triassic rock to the \u2018lighter\u2019 Tertiary volcanic sequences where the Sleeper mineralization is hosted. This major transition or break, together with other favourable structural zones, can be mapped in the field by geologists or, when covered by alluvium, using geophysical surveys. Our team has used a gravimetric survey to map the variations in density due to rock changes or significant alteration processes. At Sleeper, these favourable structures trend south-south-west (SSW), converging on our newly acquired claims.\u201d (see image below)\nParamount acquired the South Sleeper claims for $350,000 in a combination of cash and shares.\nParamount has engaged several renowned consultants including Mine Development Associates, Inc. (a division of RESPEC) to assist the Paramount team in the review of all available data including drilling, geophysical surveys and geochemistry with the objective of developing an exploration program at the district sized Sleeper project which is now complemented by the addition of the South Sleeper claims. The drill program is expected to commence this summer.\nAbout Paramount Gold Nevada Corp. Paramount Gold Nevada Corp. is a U.S. based precious metals exploration and development company. Paramount\u2019s strategy is to create shareholder value through exploring and developing its mineral properties and to realize this value for its shareholders in three ways: by selling its assets to established producers; entering joint ventures with producers for construction and operation; or constructing and operating mines for its own account.\nParamount owns 100% of the Grassy Mountain Gold Project which consists of approximately 8,200 acres located on private and BLM land in Malheur County, Oregon. The Grassy Mountain Gold Project contains a gold-silver deposit (100% located on private land) for which results of a positive Feasibility Study have been released and key permitting milestones accomplished.\nParamount owns a 100% interest in the Sleeper Gold Project located in Northern Nevada, the world\u2019s premier mining jurisdiction. The Sleeper Gold Project, which includes the former producing Sleeper mine, totals 2,322 unpatented mining claims (approximately 60 square miles or 15,500 hectares). The Sleeper gold project is host to a large gold deposit (over 4 million ounces of mineralized material) and the Company has completed and released a positive Preliminary Economic Assessment. With higher gold prices, Paramount has begun work to update and improve the economics of the Sleeper project.\nSafe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements This release and related documents may include \"forward-looking statements\" and \u201cforward-looking information\u201d (collectively, \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d) pursuant to applicable United States and Canadian securities laws.

Last month, the reopening of the economy helped German inflation jump to the highest in more than a decade. Negative interest rates in Europe are also making non-yielding assets like gold more attractive, Scherer said.\nGermany\u2019s far-right AfD has sought to use rising inflation to boost its support ahead of the Sept. 26 national election.

An article headlined \u201cInflation is Eating Up Our Savings\u201d included a graphic that showed how gasoline prices have surged, as well as steep price gains for other consumer goods.\nFirst-half demand for bar and coins in Germany increased by 35% from the previous six months, compared with 20% in the rest of the world, WGC data show.\nTaper Worry\nStill, gold prices have fallen almost 7% since early June as the market braces for the Fed to curb its massive stimulus measures that helped send the metal to a record high in 2020.\nTraders will closely watch the central bank\u2019s gathering Jackson Hole this week for clues on the timing of tapering. On the other side of the Atlantic, expectations for a rate hike by the ECB in the coming years remains muted. That may support demand for gold in Germany, even if global prices ease.\nGold has \u201calways played a certain role among German investors,\u201d said Alexander Zumpfe, senior trader at refiner Heraeus Metals Germany GmbH & Co. KG. \u201cWith the increased buying interest in recent years, however, it has become even more present.\u201d\n(Updates with context on inflation in Germany under chart.)\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\nSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\n\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.",

The Company has also entered into an acquisition agreement to acquire the Ruby Hill Mine from affiliates of Waterton Global Resource Management (\"Waterton\"). Additionally, i-80 has entered into a private placement commitment with NGM whereby, conditional on the asset exchange transaction being completed[1], NGM will acquire from i-80 up to 9.9% interest in new i-80 treasury common shares for aggregate proceeds not to exceed $50 million, and a non-binding term sheet with Orion Mine Finance (\"Orion\") for up to $240 million in acquisition and development financing. Equinox Gold Corp (\"Equinox\") has also indicated that it will participate in the equity private placement through the exercise of a portion of its anti-dilute rights.\nHighlights of the transactions are as follows:\ni-80 increases overall Inferred gold Mineral Resource more than three and a half times and more than doubles i-80's overall gold Measured + Indicated Mineral Resources1\nRuby Hill deposits host more than 100 million ounces of indicated silver mineral resources and more than 70 million ounces of inferred silver mineral resources1\nSecures for i-80, the ability to process all types of gold bearing mineralization at the centrally located Lone Tree processing facility situated on Interstate 80 once the necessary refurbishment of the facility is completed.

The Company has separately entered into a definitive membership interest purchase agreement (the \"Ruby Hill Agreement\") to acquire the Ruby Hill Mine, which includes multiple deposits that collectively, have the potential to represent one of Nevada's largest gold, silver and base metal endowments, from affiliates of Waterton Global Resource Management (\"Waterton\"). These two transactions are designed to position i-80 Gold as a prominent, stand alone, gold producer in the state of Nevada. Closing of each of the transactions with NGM, Waterton, Orion and the private placement are subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions precedent detailed further below, including regulatory approvals and, in the case of Orion, completion of due diligence and the negotiation and execution of mutually satisfactory definitive documentation.\n\"These transformational acquisitions result in a significant increase in the Company's mineral resource base, and position i-80 to become one of the largest gold producers in the State of Nevada with the capacity to process refractory and oxide mineralization\", stated Ewan Downie, Chief Executive Officer of i-80 Gold. \"Importantly, i-80 gains a strategic advantage becoming one of only three companies in Nevada with infrastructure to process refractory mineral resources once the Lone Tree facility has been retrofitted to suit the Company's deposits. We believe that this will allow i-80 to overcome a crucial barrier to entry that most of our peers face. In the interim, Nevada Gold Mines has agreed to provide processing capacity for i-80 mineral resources from the McCoy Cove, Granite Creek and Ruby Hill mines at its autoclave facilities until the earlier of three years from closing of the asset exchange and the date the Lone Tree facility becomes operational and will also provide i-80 with processing capacity for ore produced from the McCoy Cove mine at its roaster facilities for 10 years, in each case, subject to extension by mutual agreement, allowing i-80 to commence development of its assets on an expedited basis\".\nThe Lone Tree Property is being acquired from NGM, a joint-venture between the world's two largest gold producers, Barrick Gold Corporation and Newmont Corporation. Lone Tree is a strategically located facility on Interstate 80, the primary highway through northern Nevada, and proximal to the northern Nevada railway, midway between i-80's Granite Creek and McCoy-Cove projects (See Figure 1). The transaction with NGM will provide i-80 with important processing infrastructure including an autoclave, CIL mill, and a heap leach facility complete with assay lab and gold refinery, and also includes interim processing arrangements. NGM has further agreed to acquire up to a 9.9% interest in i-80 through a private placement at the Issue Price (as defined below) for proceeds not to exceed $50 million.\nThe producing Ruby Hill Mine is host to multiple deposits that collectively have the potential to represent one of the largest gold and silver resource endowments in the State of Nevada. Refractory mineralization from Ruby Hill is expected to be trucked to the Lone Tree Complex for processing following its refurbishment.\n\"The Lone Tree and Ruby Hill acquisitions will provide i-80 with substantial gold and silver resources and an opportunity to build a mid-tier gold producing company entirely within in the State of Nevada\", stated Matthew Gili, President and Chief Operating Officer of i-80 Gold. \"Ruby Hill is host to multiple gold, silver, and poly-metallic deposits that remain wide open for expansion and is expected to be a major contributor to our goal of becoming the second largest producer in Nevada\".\nLone Tree Acquisition\nLone Tree represents a strategic acquisition for i-80, providing the Company with important infrastructure that, following successful refurbishment efforts, will allow it to process refractory and oxide mineralization. Currently on care and maintenance, the property hosts existing infrastructure that includes a whole ore autoclave with capacity of 1M tonnes/year, a flotation circuit with capacity of 1.8M tonnes/year, a CIC circuit & leach pad with 6.5M tonnes of remaining capacity, a tailings dam with 1.5M tonnes of remaining constructed capacity and an additional 10M tonnes of permitted capacity, a waste dump, along with several buildings useful for the development of all i-80's projects including a warehouse, maintenance shop, admin building, and assay lab. The property is also host to substantial gold mineral resources1 and offers excellent exploration potential. All deposits at Lone Tree (Lone Tree, Second Chanse and Lynn) remain open for expansion.\nSubstantial open pit gold resources contained proximal to the Lone Tree open pit1\nResource expansion potential exists down-plunge of the main Lone Tree deposit and in the unmined Sequoia zone discovery where previous drilling returned multiple wide, high-grade, intercepts (50% estimated true width) including:\nBuffalo Mountain is a near-term development opportunity, located approximately 10 km southwest of Lone Tree, that has both open pit and underground potential.

Conditional on closing of the asset exchange, NGM has also agreed to complete a private placement for up to a 9.9% interest in i-80 for proceeds not to exceed $50 million, described further under \"Acquisition Financing\" below. At the closing of the asset exchange, NGM will also reimburse i-80 approximately $7.3 million for amounts previously advanced by i-80 for the autonomous truck haulage test work completed at South Arturo and for funds advanced by i-80 that have not been used for reclamation activities.\nIn the event i-80 restarts the processing of ore at Lone Tree, NGM will be entitled to receive the following contingent payments of up to $50 million subject to the terms and conditions of the contingent consideration agreement:\na) | An amount equal to $25.00 per recovered gold equivalent mineral reserve ounce identified in the feasibility study (the \"Feasibility Study\") for the restart of mining at the Lone Tree mine (\"Initial Contingent Consideration\"), payable in two equal installments six months and 18 months following the later of commencement of commercial production at Lone Tree and the completion of the Feasibility Study; and |\nb) | An amount equal to $25.00 per ounce of produced gold in excess of the number of recovered gold equivalent mineral reserve ounces (the \"Continuing Contingent Consideration\"), payable within five days after the end of each calendar quarter during which a payment of Continuing Contingent Consideration accrues, provided that the aggregate of the Initial Contingent Consideration and the Continuing Contingent Consideration shall not exceed $50 million. |\ni-80 considers the Lone Tree infrastructure to be a strategically located processing facility in Nevada, located on Interstate 80 with the Nevada Railway less than two kilometres to the north, and will be the platform from which i-80 intends to grow its business (see Figure 1 below).\nThe Lone Tree Deposit1 is host to a substantial gold resource that includes 410,000 ounces of gold (Indicated) at a grade of 1.77 g/t Au and 2,764,000 ounces (Inferred) at a grade of 1.69 g/t Au and offers substantial resource expansion potential at depth, down plunge (see Figure 2 below), and in the adjacent Sequoia zone (see Figure 3 below).\nThe Buffalo Mountain Property is located approximately 10 km to the West of Lone Tree (see Figure 4 below) and is host to multiple gold zones that have returned multiple significant intercepts including 10.3 g/t Au across 9.1 m and 16.8 g/t Au across 6.1 m at the Lynn zone and 5.6 g/t Au across 15.2 m and 7.9 g/t Au across 10.7 m in the Second Chanse zone (60-80% estimated true width). NGM has initiated the permitting of Buffalo Mountain for development and i-80 expects to continue this effort to commence mining Buffalo Mountain and processing material on the heap leach pad at Lone Tree. The Company expects to complete a mineral resource estimate for Buffalo Mountain in the future.\nClosing of the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement is subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions precedent, including clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976, as amended (the \"HSR Act\"), arrangement of substitute sureties (and release of existing NGM bonds) in respect of the Lone Tree and Buffalo Mountain reclamation obligations, and the approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\"), among other customary conditions to closing. The NGM equity private placement (described under \"Equity Financing\" below) is expected to close concurrently with, and subject to, the closing of the transactions under the Exchange Agreement. The transactions contemplated under the Exchange Agreement and the Ruby Hill Agreement are not inter-conditional or conditional on the completion of the Orion financing transaction. The Orion financing is conditional upon, among other things, the completion of the transactions under the Exchange Agreement and the Ruby Hill Agreement.\nRuby Hill Acquisition\nRuby Hill represents one of Nevada's premier mining projects with existing production from the Archimedes open pit, and a large property that is host to multiple gold, gold/silver, and polymetallic gold deposits, making it one of the largest and highest-grade, permitted, gold deposits in Nevada.\nSubstantial open pit gold and silver resources1 within the Mineral Point Trend\nHigh-grade underground gold mineralization at the 426 Zone\nHigh-grade underground gold mineralization at the Ruby Deeps Zone that remains open along strike to the north\nHigh-grade poly-metallic mineralization has been defined within the Blackjack\ni-80 is acquiring a 100% interest in the Ruby Hill mine and property for consideration of up to $150 million, including milestone payments that are subject to an early payment option that could reduce total consideration to $130 million as follows:\na) | $75 million cash and $8 million in shares of i-80 at closing, priced based on the market price of i-80's shares at the time of closing; |\nb) | $17 million in cash and/or shares of i-80 payable on the earlier of 60 days following the issuance of a press release by the Company regarding the completion of a new or updated Mineral Resource estimate for the Ruby Hill Property or 15 months after closing, priced based on the market price of i-80's shares at the time of such payment (the \"First Milestone Payment\"); |\nc) | $15 million in cash and/or shares of i-80 payable on the earlier of 60 days following the issuance of a press release by the Company regarding the completion of a Feasibility Study for the Ruby Hill mine or 24 months after closing, priced based on the market price of i-80's shares at the time of such payment (the \"Second Milestone Payment\"); |\nd) | $15 million in cash and/or shares of i-80 payable on the earlier of 30 months after closing and 90 days following the announcement by the Company of a construction decision related to a deposit on any portion of the Ruby Hill Properties that is not currently being mined, priced based on the market price of i-80's shares at the time of such payment (the \"Third Milestone Payment\"); and |\ne) | $20 million in cash and/or shares of i-80 payable on the earlier of 36 months after closing and 90 days following the announcement by the Company of achieving Commercial Production related to a deposit on any portion of the Properties that is not currently being mined, priced based on the market price of i-80's shares at the time of such payment (the \"Fourth Milestone Payment\"). |\nUp to 50% of the foregoing Milestone Payments may consist of i-80 shares, provided that the number of i\u201380 shares then held by Waterton after giving effect to the share issuance shall not exceed 9.99% of then issued and outstanding shares of i-80 calculated on a partially diluted basis. i-80 shall have the right to prepay the Second Milestone Payment by paying to Waterton, on or before 15 months following closing, $10 million provided that up to $7.5 million of such amount may be satisfied, at i-80's option, in common shares of the Company, priced based on the market price of i-80's shares at the time of such prepayment and i-80 shall have the right to prepay the aggregate of the Third and Fourth Milestone Payments by paying to Waterton, on or before 24 months following closing $20 million provided that up to $10 million of such amount may be satisfied, at i-80's option, in common shares of the Company, priced based on the market price of i-80's shares at the time of such prepayment, provided that the number of i-80 shares then held by Waterton after giving effect to the share issuance shall not exceed 9.99% of then issued and outstanding shares of i-80 calculated on a partially diluted basis.\nRuby Hill includes an open pit mine and related infrastructure (mill/heap leach) and is located immediately west of the town of Eureka proximal to Highway 50.\nThe Ruby Hill Property is host to multiple gold, silver and base metal deposits that collectively comprise one of Nevada's largest mineral endowments that offer substantial upside. Open pit oxide and transitional resources occur in the Mineral Point, Archimedes West and Archimedes East Zones. Underground sulfide Mineral resources occur in the 426, Ruby Deeps and Blackjack Zones (Figure 5)\nMultiple gold and polymetallic exploration targets exist on the property and i-80 will begin an aggressive exploration program immediately following closing. The Company will begin permitting for the construction of a decline to access the high-grade Ruby Deeps deposit and the Blackjack Zone with the intent of trucking refractory mineralization for processing at Lone Tree. Completion of the current mine plan at the Ruby Hill pit will continue with processing at the heap leach facility on the property. Ruby Hill also includes crushing and CIL processing infrastructure (see Figure 6)\nClosing of the transactions contemplated by the Ruby Hill Agreement are subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions precedent, including regulatory approvals, and the approval of the TSX. i-80 expects to close the Orion financing transaction concurrently with the transactions contemplated by the Ruby Hill Agreement.\nAcquisition Financing\nIn connection with the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement, NGM has agreed to subscribe for new common shares from treasury at a price per share equal to C$2.62 (the \"Issue Price\"), (being the five day volume weighted average trading price of i-80's common shares ending on the trading date prior to this announcement) in an amount equal to the lesser of $50 million and the amount that would result in NGM holding 9.9% of the issued and outstanding common shares of i-80 on a non-diluted basis, but after giving effect to the private placement (including any participation by other subscribers, including Equinox. upon exercise of its pre-emptive rights and any shares issued to Waterton on or prior to the private placement). The private placement with NGM is part of larger non-brokered private placement offering of common shares by i-80, which includes Orion, of up to $90 million at the Issue Price, not including any shares that may be issued to Equinox upon the exercise of their anti-dilute rights.\nThe Company has also entered into a non-binding term sheet with Orion for a comprehensive $140 million financing package, complementing the Company's existing strong balance sheet. The Orion financing is contemplated to include a mix of equity and convertible securities, warrants as well as secured instruments, and has a target size of $140 million and, at the election of i-80, an accordion feature of up to an additional $100 million. The equity, convertible securities and the warrants will be priced based on the Issue Price subject to TSX approval.\n\"The financing packages secured and being pursued with Nevada Gold Mines and Orion, combined with interim processing arrangements, are meant to provide i-80 with the ability to immediately begin development of its substantial portfolio of advanced stage deposits located in one of the world's most favourable jurisdictions for mining\", stated Matthew Gollat, EVP Business & Corporate Development for i\u201380. \"The financing packages were structured to limit dilution to our shareholders while providing the Company with potential capacity to aggressively grow our business.\"\nThis news release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the common shares described herein in the United States or in any other jurisdiction, nor shall there be any sale of the common shares in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

Perseus expects to complete a maiden Mineral Resource estimate in the March 2022 quarter. Edikan\u2019s mine life is currently forecast to end in FY2025 however, this discovery at Nkosuo has the potential to extend the mine life well beyond that date.\nPerseus\u2019s Managing Director and CEO Jeff Quartermaine said:\n\u201cWith our three gold mines now in operation and Perseus moving closer by the day to achieving our goal of producing 500,000 ounces of gold per year, we have turned our sights to finding ways of sustaining this level of gold production from our operations out to the end of the decade and beyond.\nOur exploration programme at Nkosuo has so far, returned impressive results that demonstrate the potential of this prospect to add to Edikan\u2019s mine life with further drilling. We are particularly encouraged by similarities between the Nkosuo deposit and the Fobinso and Abnabna deposits which we\u2019ve already successfully mined and processed at Edikan.\nWhile we are working towards completing a maiden Mineral Resource estimate for Nkosuo in early CY2022, we intend to continue exploring on the Agyakusu, Agyakusu-DML and Domenase exploration licence areas, all of which are under option to Perseus and all of which are located within trucking distance of our Edikan mill.\u201d\nBACKGROUND\nFollowing the successful commissioning of its third operating mine, Yaour\u00e9, in December 2020, Perseus Mining Limited (ASX/TSX: PRU) has committed to a comprehensive organic growth programme, aimed at discovering sufficient incremental Ore Reserves at each of its three operating mines to maintain its total annual production level at 500,000 ounces of gold per year through to the end of the decade and beyond.\nResults from its recent exploration activities adjacent to Edikan demonstrate outstanding potential to grow its gold inventory at the mine through further drilling success.\nThe 23.85km2 Agyakusu prospecting licence, 2-8km NNW of Edikan, is currently held by Ghanaian company Adio-Mabas Ghana Ltd, however Perseus secured an option to acquire the Exploration Licence in November 2019 (see ASX announcement 4 November 2019). Since acquiring the option on the licence area, Perseus has conducted soil sampling and airborne geophysical surveys whilst negotiating access from farmers to drill the granite hosted Nkosuo gold prospect (formerly known as the Breman prospect). Access to the area for drilling was achieved in June this year, with drilling commencing immediately afterwards.\nNKOSUO EXPLORATION DRILLING\nExploration drilling commenced at the Nkosuo prospect on the Agyakusu permit on 1st July 2021 (Figures 1 and 2). Up to 30 September 2021, a total of 7,801 metres had been drilled in 13 Reverse Circulation (\u201cRC\u201d), eight diamond (\u201cDD\u201d) holes (including five metallurgical holes) and 26 RC pre-collared diamond holes (\u201cRD\u201d). Drilling was conducted on a nominal 80 x 80 metre grid to scope out the extent and overall geometry of the host granite and contained mineralisation, locally infilled to 40 x 40 metres. Results received to date have been highly encouraging, indicating strong potential for shallow open-pitable gold resources just seven kilometres from the Edikan mill.\nThe mineralisation at Nkosuo is hosted by a NNE-trending granitic plug extending at least 600m in strike, with widths ranging up to 200m. Results to date indicate the strongest mineralisation is focused in the northern 300m section of the intrusive. The granite body dips at around 700 to the west in the northern part of the intrusion, steepening to near vertical towards the south. Drilling has defined the northern limits of the ore body but it remains open to the south, though narrowing to around 100m. Mineralisation within the granite consists of variably intense quartz stockwork veining with associated quartz-carbonate-sericite alteration. The veining and alteration are accompanied by 1-2% disseminated and selvage pyrite and arsenopyrite, with better gold grades generally associated with higher concentrations of arsenopyrite. The enclosing Birimian metasediments are devoid of mineralisation. Overall, the Nkosuo mineralisation bears strong similarities to the western granite-hosted deposits at Edikan such as Fobinso and Abnabna.\nBetter intercepts from the Nkosuo drilling are shown below in Table 1 with a complete summary included in Appendix 2 - Table 1.\nTable 1: Intercepts from Agyakusu Prospecting Licence - Nkosuo Prospect\n(Based on lower cut-off of 0.5 g/t Au with maximum 2m internal waste <0.5 g/t)\n| Hole ID | From (m) | To (m) | Gold Intercept |\n| NKS0001RC | 23 | 55 | 32m @ 2.61 g/t |\n| NKS0002RD | 12 | 49 | 37m @ 1.10 g/t |\n| NKS0002RD | 229 | 234 | 5m @ 21.22 g/t |\n| NKS0004RD | 50 | 150 | 100m @ 1.82 g/t |\n| NKS0005RD | 82 | 93 | 11m @ 1.59 g/t |\n| NKS0005RD | 117 | 148 | 31m @ 1.12 g/t |\n| NKS0005RD | 152 | 167 | 15m @ 1.48 g/t |\n| NKS0005RC | 14 | 26 | 12m @ 1.02 g/t |\n| NKS0006RD | 27 | 31 | 4m @ 6.60 g/t |\n| NKS0006RD | 66 | 79 | 13m @ 1.54 g/t |\n| NKS0007DD | 0 | 31 | 31m @ 1.26 g/t |\n| NKS0007DD | 43.2 | 63.2 | 20m @ 0.83 g/t |\n| NKS0007DD | 75 | 96.5 | 21.50m @ 1.32 g/t |\n| NKS0007DD | 111 | 130 | 19m @ 1.29 g/t |\n| NKS0008RD | 23 | 36 | 13m @ 1.10 g/t |\n| NKS0008RD | 42 | 117.2 | 75.20m @ 2.71 g/t |\n| NKS0011RC | 19 | 26 | 7m @ 1.04 g/t |\n| NKS0013RC | 41 | 86 | 45m @ 1.97 g/t |\n| NKS0014RC | 54 | 67 | 13m @ 1.28 g/t |\n| NKS0014RC | 85 | 102 | 17m @ 2.18 g/t |\n| NKS0015RD | 22 | 37 | 15m @ 1.17 g/t |\n| NKS0015RD | 85 | 144 | 59m @ 1.33g/t |\n| NKS0018RD | 212.4 | 216.4 | 4m @ 10.22 g/t |\n| NKS0019RD | 5 | 27 | 22m @ 2.30 g/t Au |\n| NKS0019RD | 69 | 87 | 18m @ 1.91 g/t |\n| NKS0019RD | 107.5 | 145 | 37.5m @ 1.12 g/t |\n| NKS0020RD | 56 | 63 | 7m @ 2.78 g/t |\n| NKS0021RD | 1 | 31 | 30m @ 1.21 g/t |\n| NKS0021RD | 120 | 160 | 40m @ 0.91 g/t |\n| NKS0026RC | 3 | 10 | 7m @ 1.17 g/t |\n| NKS0026RC | 23 | 48 | 25m @ 0.96 g/t |\nDrill results available to date from the Nkosuo drilling indicate an Exploration Target of 10 to 15 Mt grading 0.9 to 1.1 g/t gold for 275 to 500 koz contained gold.\nThe Exploration Target is based on the drill hole assay data available on 28 September 2021 (Table 2) and the current understanding of mineralisation geometry and style. Being conceptual in nature, it takes no account of geological complexity, possible mining method or metallurgical recovery factors. The Exploration Target was estimated to enable an early assessment of the discovery\u2019s potential to add to Edikan\u2019s mine life.\nThe potential quantity and grade of the Exploration Target is conceptual in nature and therefore is an approximation. There has been insufficient exploration to estimate a Mineral Resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in estimation of a Mineral Resource. The Exploration Target has been prepared and reported in accordance with the 2012 edition of the JORC Code.\nTable 2: Nkosuo assays available on 28 September 2021\n| Hole Type | No. of Holes | Sample Type | Total | In Granite | ||\n| No. Assays | Metres Assayed | No. Assays | Metres Assayed | |||\n| RC | 11 | RC | 559 | 995 | 314 | 314 |\n| Cored from Surface | 2 | DD | 254 | 287 | 252 | 284 |\n| Pre-collared DD | 17 | RC | 1305 | 1595 | 1185 | 1281 |\n| 11 | DD | 1287 | 1408 | 1190 | 1323 | |\n| Totals | 3405 | 4285 | 2941 | 3202 |\nThe Exploration Target is defined by:\n-\nA wireframe of the host granite body used to limit the extent of interpreted mineralisation volume\n-\nDrill sample intervals composited to uniform 2m down-hole lengths with composite gold grades capped at 10g/t\n-\nGold grades estimated by inverse distance squared weightings (IDW) into parent blocks with dimensions 20m east x 20m north x 10m elevation using a 50m east x 100m north x 100m elevation search ellipsoid with a minimum of four samples required to make an estimate\n-\nEstimates informed only by samples within the granite\n-\nParent blocks sub-blocked against the granite wireframe and interpreted weathering surfaces using a minimum 5m east x 5m north x 2.5m elevation sub-block to reliably estimate the mineralisation volume\n-\nDensities for weathered, transition and fresh rock assumed to be 1.8, 2.1 and 2.7 tonnes per cubic metre\n-\nSub-blocks grading greater than 0.4g/t gold and to a maximum vertical depth of approximately 170 metres.\nFORWARD PROGRAMME\n-\nDrilling now underway at Nkosuo will focus on closing up the current hole spacing to 40 x 40 metres and ultimately to 20 x 20 metres to support a Mineral Resource estimate to be undertaken in the March 2022 quarter.\n-\nMetallurgical testwork and geotechnical drilling is about to commence so the Ore Reserve potential can be evaluated early in the September Quarter of 2022. In anticipation that this work will lead to a positive outcome the Company is in the process of exercising its option over the Agyakusu permit. Early work to meet the requirements of the ESIA process is also being planned.\n-\nExploration more broadly at Edikan will focus on prospective opportunities identified on adjacent tenements, including the Agyakusu DML permit, where soil geochemical sampling has identified strong gold-in-soil anomalies along strike from the Nkosuo prospect, and the Domenase permit to the north of Nkosuo.\nThis announcement has been approved for release by Perseus\u2019s Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Jeff Quartermaine.\nCOMPETENT PERSON STATEMENT:\nThe information in this report and the attachments that relate to exploration drilling results and the Nkosuo Exploration Target on the Agyakusu permit is based on, and fairly represents, information and supporting documentation prepared by Dr Douglas Jones, a Competent Person who is a Chartered Professional Geologist.

and data\n(Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections)\n| Criteria | JORC Code Explanation | Commentary | |||\n| Sampling techniques | Nature and quality of sampling (e.g. cut channels, random chips, or specific specialised industry standard measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under investigation, such as down hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc.). These examples should not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling. | Other than for soil sampling and an airborne EM-magnetics-radiometrics survey conducted in 2020 there has been no previous mineral exploration at Nkosuo. The presence of gold mineralisation was first revealed by artisanal miners in 2019. Perseus commenced drilling in July 2021. Drilling completed to the end of September 2021 is tabulated below. | |||\n| Include reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and the appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems used. | Drilling Type | No. Holes | RC metres | DD metres | |\n| Aspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to the Public Report. In cases where \u2018industry standard\u2019 work has been done this would be relatively simple (e.g. \u2018reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay\u2019). In other cases more explanation may be required, such as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems. Unusual commodities or mineralisation types (e.g. submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information. | RC | 13 | 1,133.00 | 0.00 | |\n| Pre-collared DD | 26 | 2,665.30 | 3,451.80 | ||\n| DD from surface | 8 | 0.00 | 551.00 | ||\n| Totals | 47 | 3,798.30 | 4,002.80 | ||\n| RC drilling used face-sampling hammers with 136mm hole diameter. Samples were collected at one metre intervals and logged visually for recovery, sample condition (dry, damp, wet) and contamination. Sample recoveries were measured by weighing bulk recovered samples. | |||||\n| Diamond drilling utilised HQ triple-tube (61.1mm \u00d8) drilling in weathered materials and NQ2 (50.6mm \u00d8) diameter core in fresh rock. Diamond core recoveries were measured linearly per drill run. Core recoveries average 70% in weathered materials and 100% in fresh rock. | |||||\n| Drilling techniques | Drill type (e.g. core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc.) and details (e.g. core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of diamond tails, face-sampling bit or other type, whether core is oriented and if so, by what method, etc.). | RC drilling used face-sampling hammers with 136mm hole diameter. Samples were collected at one metre intervals. | |||\n| Diamond drilling utilised HQ triple-tube (61.1mm \u00d8) drilling in weathered materials and NQ2 (50.6mm \u00d8) diameter core in fresh rock. Core in fresh rock was oriented using a \u201cReflex ACT II\u201d device. | |||||\n| Drill sample recovery | Method of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries and results assessed. | RC drill samples were logged visually for recovery, sample condition (dry, damp, wet) and contamination. Sample recoveries were measured by weighing bulk recovered samples. Preliminary evaluation indicates that RC sample recoveries have averaged 19.3kg in weathered material and 29.3kg in fresh rock. 64 samples (3%) have been logged as being wet. | |||\n| Measures taken to maximise sample recovery and ensure representative nature of the samples. | Diamond core recoveries were measured linearly per drill run. Core recoveries average 70% in weathered materials and 100% in fresh rock. | ||||\n| Whether a relationship exists between sample recovery and grade and whether sample bias may have occurred due to preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse material. | The Competent Person considers that there are presently insufficient data available to permit a meaningful examination of potential relationships between sample recovery and gold grade. | ||||\n| Logging | Whether core and chip samples have been geologically and geotechnically logged to a level of detail to support appropriate Mineral Resource estimation, mining studies and metallurgical studies. | Geological logs are available for the entire lengths of all drill holes. The logging is qualitative in nature. | |||\n| Whether logging is qualitative or quantitative in nature. Core (or costean, channel, etc.) photography. | Sieved samples of RC chips from each metre of drilling were logged for colour, rock type, alteration type and intensity, vein quartz content, sulphide mineralisation, weathering and oxidation. The chips are stored in plastic chip trays and the trays are photographed. | ||||\n| The total length and percentage of the relevant intersections logged. | Diamond drill core was logged for geology, structure and geotechnical characteristics. Geological logging included colour, lithology, weathering, oxidation, vein type and vein volume percentage, sulphide species and their estimated percentage, alteration and alteration intensity. Structural logging included fault, fold, cleavage and joint orientation, lithological contacts and vein orientations. Drill core was photographed prior to cutting. | ||||\n| Sub-sampling techniques and sample preparation | If core, whether cut or sawn and whether quarter, half or all core taken. | RC drill samples were collected at drill sites over one metre intervals and manually split using multi-stage riffle splitters to produce assay sub-samples averaging around 3kg. All RC holes have been assayed in entirety. | |||\n| If non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, rotary split, etc. and whether sampled wet or dry. | In weathered materials, diamond core was halved using spatulas or knives. In fresh rock, core was sawn in half using a diamond blade saw, with one half sent for assaying and the other half stored in core trays for reference. Samples were normally taken at 1 metre intervals. All diamond drill core has been assayed. | ||||\n| For all sample types, the nature, quality and appropriateness of the sample preparation technique. | Preparation of core and RC samples followed a standard path of drying at 105 degrees C for at least 12 hours, crushing the entire sample to 85% passing -2mm and grinding a 1.5kg split to 85% passing 75 microns. 300g pulp subsamples are selected by multiple scoop passes. | ||||\n| Quality control procedures adopted for all sub-sampling stages to maximise representivity of samples. | Quality control measures adopted to confirm the representivity of samples from RC and diamond drilling include: | ||||\n| Measures taken to ensure that the sampling is representative of the in-situ material collected, including for instance results for field duplicate/second-half sampling. |\n| ||||\n| Whether sample sizes are appropriate to the grain size of the material being sampled. |\n| ||||\n| Sample preparation techniques are considered appropriate to the style of mineralisation. Available information indicates that sample sizes are appropriate to the grain size of the material being sampled. | |||||\n| Quality of assay data and laboratory tests | The nature, quality and appropriateness of the assaying and laboratory procedures used and whether the technique is considered partial or total. | All RC and diamond core samples have been assayed by 50g fire assay with AAS determination by Intertek Testing Services Ghana at their Tarkwa assay laboratory. The technique is considered a total extraction technique. | |||\n| For geophysical tools, spectrometers, handheld XRF instruments, etc., the parameters used in determining the analysis including instrument make and model, reading times, calibrations factors applied and their derivation, etc. | Quality control procedures include submission of coarse blanks (1:20) and certified reference standards (1:20). | ||||\n| Nature of quality control procedures adopted (e.g. standards, blanks, duplicates, external laboratory checks) and whether acceptable levels of accuracy (i.e. lack of bias) and precision have been established. | The available information indicates that the assaying of RC and core samples is free from any significant biases and is of acceptable accuracy. | ||||\n| Verification of sampling and assaying | The verification of significant intersections by either independent or alternative company personnel. | Numerous significant mineralised intersections have been checked against visual alteration and sulphide mineralisation in drill chips and core. | |||\n| The use of twinned holes. | No holes have been deliberately twinned. | ||||\n| Documentation of primary data, data entry procedures, data verification, data storage (physical and electronic) protocols. | Geology, structure and geotechnical logs are paper based. Sample intervals are recorded in pre-numbered sample ticket books. All logging, sample interval and survey data are manually entered to digital form on site and stored in an acQuire relational database. Data exports are normally in the form of MS Access files. | ||||\n| Discuss any adjustment to assay data. | Data verification procedures include automated checks to:\nDown-hole survey data are examined for large deviations in dip or azimuth that may represent erroneous data or data entry errors and corrected on a case-by-case basis including estimates of dips and azimuths where the original data appear to be in error. | ||||\n| Location of data points | Accuracy and quality of surveys used to locate drill holes (collar and down-hole surveys), trenches, mine workings and other locations used in Mineral Resource estimation. | Drill hole collars have been surveyed by qualified mine surveyors using differential GPS equipment with coordinates recorded in UTM grid, WGS84 Zone 30N datum. | |||\n| Specification of the grid system used. | All RC and diamond core holes have been surveyed at 12m depth and at approximately 30m down-hole increments using digital compass instruments. | ||||\n| Quality and adequacy of topographic control. | A topographic surface has been established by a drone photogrammetric survey conducted in 2020. The topographic surface is expected to be reliable to +/- 0.2m. | ||||\n| Topographic control is adequate for the current work being undertaken at Nkosuo. | |||||\n| Data spacing and distribution | Data spacing for reporting of Exploration Results. | The Nkosuo prospect is delineated by regular drilling at 80m x 80m X-Y spacing in holes dipping at -55 degrees toward 160 degrees (UTM grid) azimuth. The drill pattern has been partially infilled to 40m x 80m in places. Drill coverage generally extends to about 150m vertical depth and to a maximum of about 280m depth. | |||\n| Whether the data spacing and distribution is sufficient to establish the degree of geological and grade continuity appropriate for the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimation procedure(s) and classifications applied. | The data spacing has established geological continuity of the host granite but has not defined the continuity of mineralisation sufficiently to permit reliable estimation of Mineral Resources. | ||||\n| Whether sample compositing has been applied. | |||||\n| Orientation of data in relation to geological structure | Whether the orientation of sampling achieves unbiased sampling of possible structures and the extent to which this is known, considering the deposit type. | Drill holes are oriented approximately orthogonal to the trend of the granite body that hosts mineralisation. The orientation of mineralised structures within the granite is presently unconfirmed but there is no indication that exploration results to date are affected by a significant bias due to orientation. | |||\n| If the relationship between the drilling orientation and the orientation of key mineralised structures is considered to have introduced a sampling bias, this should be assessed and reported if material. | |||||\n| Sample security | The measures taken to ensure sample security. | RC and core samples were delivered to the secure core yard compound at Edikan mine by Perseus personnel. RC field sample splits and samples of half diamond core were placed in numbered bags and those bags, in turn, placed into polywoven sacks that were closed with plastic cable ties prior to transport to the assay laboratory by laboratory personnel. Security guards were employed at drilling sites and at the core yard compound on a 24 hour per day basis. | |||\n| Results of field duplicates along with the general consistency of assay results between adjacent drill holes and drilling methods provide confidence in the general reliability of the assay data. | |||||\n| Audits or reviews | The results of any audits or reviews of sampling techniques and data. | Nkosuo drill hole data have not been subject to any formal audit. | |||\n| The Competent Person has reviewed the available sampling and assaying quality control data and found no errors or bias likely to significantly affect the reliability of the exploration data. These reviews included review of database consistency, comparisons between database records and laboratory source files, and review of QAQC information. | |||||\n| The Competent Person considers that the sample preparation, security and analytical procedures adopted for the Nkosuo drilling provide an adequate basis for the reporting of Exploration Results. |\nJORC 2012 Table 1 \u2013 Section 2 Reporting of Exploration Results\n(Criteria listed in the preceding section also apply to this section)\n| Criteria | JORC Code explanation | Commentary |\n| Mineral tenement and land tenure status | Type, reference name/number, location and ownership including agreements or material issues with third parties such as joint ventures, partnerships, overriding royalties, native title interests, historical sites, wilderness or national park and environmental settings. | The Nkosuo prospect is located on the Agyakusu Prospecting Licence PL2/177 granted to Adio-Mabas Ghana Limited and renewed on 15th January 2020. The permit is valid until 14th January 2023. In 2019 Perseus Mining (Ghana) Limited entered into an agreement with Adio-Mabas Ghana Limited under which it has an option to purchase the permit. Perseus has exercised its option and ministerial approval to transfer the permit to Perseus Mining (Ghana) Limited is being applied for. Should Perseus apply for a mining lease, the Government of Ghana shall retain a 10% free carried interest in holding company Perseus Mining (Ghana) Limited. Additionally, the Government of Ghana is entitled to a 5% royalty on nett revenue (revenue minus transport and refining costs). |\n| Exploration done by other parties | Acknowledgment and appraisal of exploration by other parties. | There has been no exploration by other parties. |\n| Geology | Deposit type, geological setting and style of mineralisation. | The Nkosuo prospect is a granite-hosted orogenic gold deposit similar to several deposits exploited at Perseus\u2019s nearby Edikan Gold Mine. Edikan gold deposits occur near the western flank of the Ashanti Greenstone Belt along the Obuasi-Akropong gold corridor. The Central Ashanti property is underlain principally by Paleoproterozoic Birimian metasediments of the Kumasi-Afema basin, positioned between the Ashanti and Sefwi Greenstone Belts. The flysch type metasediments consist of dacitic volcaniclastics, greywackes plus argillaceous (phyllitic) sediments, intensely folded, faulted and metamorphosed to upper green schist facies. Minor cherty and manganiferous exhalative sediments are locally present, and graphitic schists coincide with the principal shear (thrust) zones. Numerous small Basin-type or Cape Coast-type granitoids have intruded the sediments along several regional structures. Structurally controlled gold mineralisation occurs in two principal modes: disseminated pyrite-arsenopyrite mineralisation associated with quartz veining and sericite alteration hosted by granitoids and shear-zone hosted mineralisation associated with pyrite-arsenopyrite mineralisation in and adjacent to quartz veins in deformed metasedimentary rocks. |\n| Drill hole Information | A summary of all information material to the understanding of the exploration results including a tabulation of the following information for all Material drill holes:\nIf the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the information is not Material and this exclusion does not detract from the understanding of the report, the Competent Person should clearly explain why this is the case. | A table of drill hole and intercept details is included in the report to which this table relates. |\n| Data aggregation methods | In reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (e.g. cutting of high grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material and should be stated. | The cut-off grade, minimum down-hole length and maximum included internal waste are clearly stated in the report to which this table relates. |\n| Relationship between mineralization widths and intercept lengths | These relationships are particularly important in the reporting of Exploration Results. | The geometry of the host granite body has been established but the orientation(s) of mineralised zones within the granite are not yet defined. Intercepts are clearly described as down-hole lengths because true widths are not presently known. |\n| Diagrams | Appropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts should be included for any significant discovery being reported. These should include, but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views. | Appropriate plans and cross-sections are included in the report to which this table relates. |\n| Balanced reporting | Where comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not practicable, representative reporting of both low and high grades and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading reporting of Exploration Results. | Holes that did not intercept significant mineralisation are shown on plans and cross-sections and \u201cNSI\u201d holes are included in tables of intercepts. |\n| Other substantive exploration data | Other exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported including (but not limited to): geological observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk samples \u2013 size and method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating substances. | Soil sampling has defined a strong gold-in-soil anomaly over the Nkosuo prospect. The airborne geophysical survey has helped elucidate the general geology of the area. Otherwise, there are no other material exploration data yet available for Nkosuo prospect. |\n| Further work | The nature and scale of planned further work (e.g. tests for lateral extensions or depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling). | Perseus intends to continue drilling at Nkosuo to delineate a Mineral Resource and to undertake such other studies as are required to complete a feasibility study, economic evaluation and estimate of Ore Reserves that will contribute to the Life-of-Mine plan at Edikan. |",

Not all assets tend to decline during broader declines in the stock market.\nToday, I will discuss Barrick Gold (TSX:ABX)(NYSE:GOLD) stock. It is a company that could be an excellent asset to hold during a market correction due to the inversely proportional nature of gold prices to the overall economy.\nIdeal mining operations\nBarrick Gold owns and operates multiple valuable mining operations worldwide. Two of the company\u2019s mines in Mali have managed to produce significant amounts of gold and copper, despite the political unrest in the country. The mines are expected to beat the company\u2019s production guidance.\nThe company has also been expanding its mining operations elsewhere to continue delivering better results. Barrick Gold management has established strong in-country partnerships to pursue its mining operations and extending the lifetime of its operations.\nWith open-pit deposits in its mining operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo and its Acacia mines in Tanzania, the gold producer has unlocked more potential to increase its production capacity and continue to deliver stellar returns. The company\u2019s enhanced understanding of geology has consistently provided good results for Barrick Gold, and the company plans to continue extending the mine life in several locations for years to come.\nFoolish takeaway\nBarrick Gold stock has made significant progress in recent years. The company saw challenging times when gold prices declined five years ago, and the company was burdened by massive debt. However, rising gold prices since 2016 and the management\u2019s focus to pay down debts and improve operational efficiencies have allowed Barrick Gold to become significantly profitable again.\nBarrick Gold\u2019s management capitalized on the company\u2019s free cash flow last year to become virtually debt-free. The company looks set to continue allocating its growing cash flows to become increasingly profitable in the coming years.",

Further, we look forward to seeing the exploration work commence at Birch Lake with our option partner First Mining.\"\nGHANA\nManfo Project\nA diamond drilling program commenced on the Manfo Project designed to test for extensions to the known mineralization in the Pokukrom East and Pokukrom West deposits. Pokukrom East and West contain the majority of the gold resource at Manfo, estimated to be 195,000 oz (at 1.52 g/t Au) Indicated and 298,000 oz (at 0.96 g/t Au) Inferred by SRK in June of 2013. Refer to the Mineral Resource Evaluation Technical Report, Manfo Gold Project, Ghana, authored by SRK and released by Pelangio on June 21, 2013.\nA 3,700-meter diamond drilling program has been engineered to test for down-dip and down-plunge extensions to the mineralization in these two deposits in addition to evaluating exploration targets in the immediate vicinity. The drilling program commenced in September with two holes in progress on the smaller, higher-grade Pokukrom West deposit, where historic drilling by Pelangio returned a number of high-grade intercepts including 32.90 g/t Au over 10 meters (hole SPDD-090), 8.60 g/t Au over 12 meters (hole SPDD-084) and 4.49 g/t Au over 26 meters including 8.08 g/t Au over 12 meters (hole SPDD-083), with all Au intercepts reported \"un-cut\".\nThe first hole at Pokukrom West was completed to a final depth of 151.5 meters and was designed to provide an improved structural understanding of the mineralization from oriented drill core with the hole drilled in the midst of previous high-grade drill holes. Assays are pending. The second hole is in progress, planned for 230 meters depth, and is designed to test for the down-plunge continuation of the high-grade mineralization at Pokukrom West approximately 175 meters down-plunge (to the north) of previous drilling. Refer to Figure 1.\nThe drilling program will pause after completion of these initial two holes to allow for sampling to be completed and assays received as the results could alter the planned drill hole priorities if exceptional results are returned.\nFigure 1:Planned Diamond Drilling at Pokukrom, Manfo Project\nDankran Project\nA maiden RC exploration drilling program consisting of 2,491 meters drilled in 36 RC holes was completed on the Dankran Project in June with the results reported by Pelangio on July 21, 2021. Sampling was conducted at 1 meter drill intervals and were composited to 2 meters for analysis by Fire Assay. The 1-meter samples from all significant drill intercepts plus \"shoulder' samples were recently submitted to the Intertek Minerals Limited laboratory in Tarkwa Ghana for 50g Fire Assay for a check of the results and in order to provide a more accurate measure of gold mineralized widths. Results returned varied considerably from the initial 2-meter composited results with several mineralized intervals being diminished while several others were significantly improved in the 1-meter analyses. For example, hole DKRC036, which reported 4.30 g/t Au over 2 meters from the 2-meter composite samples returned a significantly higher grade 14.17 g/t Au over 3 meters (uncut) including 39.20 g/t Au over 1 meter from the recent 1-meter assay exercise. This suggests the possibility of a nugget component to the gold mineralization at Dankran, not unusual for high-grade vein-hosted gold mineralization, and also indicates the potential for higher grades than was returned from the initial 2-meter analyses of the Dankran drilling. Future drilling will consider 2 kg bottle roll (BLEG) analysis and/or screened metallics fire assay to check for and counter a gold nugget issue. Refer to Figure 2.\nThe Dankran RC drilling program has returned significant results over 2.7 kilometers of strike along a regional metavolcanic-metasedimentary contact 28 kilometers northeast of AngloGold Ashanti's giant Obuasi gold mine, with minimal and shallow drill testing performed to date. Further drilling will be planned to infill the limited drilling conducted as well as to investigate the potential at depth with several deeper core holes.\nFigure 2:Dankran RC Drilling Results and Soil Geochemistry\nCANADA\nDome West Project\nThe Dome West Property is located in main portion of the Timmins mining camp, more specifically the property is comprised of 10 mining cells or 56 hectares of mineral rights located approximately 800 meters west of Newmont's Dome Mine and 450 meters northwest of the former Paymaster Mine (see Figure 3). A recent review compiled from historical level plan data from government reports and limited underground drill hole data from the adjoining former Paymaster Mine has allowed for the planning of the final proposed program. The following salient points from this review are as follows:\nUnderground Paymaster Mine drill holes collared at the 1000-foot level (304.8 m) of the mine to the east of the Dome West property boundary (see Figures 3 and 4) demonstrated the existence of a series of gold bearing felsic porphyritic (FP) intrusive bodies and sills. The better gold values from these FP intrusives returned 21.6 g/t gold over 1.82meter and 59.6 g/t gold over 1.98 meters. The FP intrusives also contained numerous anomalous intercepts ranging from 0.342 to 1.03 g/t gold. Due to the proximity of these intrusives to the Dome West property boundary, interpretation suggests that the strike and dip projections of the FP intrusives will cross the Dome West boundary. These FP intrusives are representative of very high-quality targets which are untested on the Dome West Property. It can be noted that substantial amounts of gold and copper ore have been mined from FP intrusives in the various mines in Timmins such as the former McIntyre Mine and Preston East Dome. (References: Historical Paymaster Drill Holes PM10155 & PM10156; and Gold 86 International Symposium Proceedings, A.J. Macdonald,1986)\nThe review of composite level plan data from OGS Report 58 (Furguson, S.1968) and a recent Pelangio drill hole DW1901 demonstrated that the prospective Vipond stratigraphy which hosts a substantial portion of the ore at the Dome and Paymaster mines crosses the Dome West boundary from the Paymaster Mine at the 1000-foot level (304.8 m). (See Figure 4) This significant target horizon is virtually untested on the Dome West Property for 400 meters of strike length and no drilling below 300 meters, the depth at which the Vipond stratigraphy crosses the Dome West boundary line.\nFigure 3: Area Location Map with Proposed Hole Locations\nPelangio has signed a drill contract and anticipates commencing a first phase drill program of 1200 meters in late October. This is the first test of both the feldspar porphyry target extension and the prospective Vipond stratigraphy in the history of the property.\nFigure 4: Composite Level Plan\nGowan Property\nThe Gowan polymetallic property is a 4.3 square kilometer property located in Gowan Township, 27 kilometers (\"km\") northeast of the City of Timmins, Ontario and approximately 16 km due east of Glencore's Kidd Mine Site. The property is prospective for both copper-zinc-VMS deposits with associated precious metals, and nickel-copper-sulphide deposits.\nThe northeastern portion of the Gowan property is underlain by a prospective felsic volcanic package of rocks. Limited exploration efforts in the early to mid 1970's focused on evaluating the northern portion of the property for a Kidd style copper-zinc volcanogenic massive sulphide (\"VMS\") deposit. These early exploration programs were successful in demonstrating the potential for this type of mineralization. The highlight of these early exploration efforts was a broad semi-massive sulphide intercept grading 0.32% Cu and 0.35 oz/ton Ag over 36 feet. A shorter interval within this broad section returned 0.66% Cu and 0.31 oz/ton Agover 12.5 feet including an interval of 0.95% Cu and 0.20 oz/ton Ag across 3 feet. Also of note is a bedrock sample from the bottom of a reverse circulation (RC) drill hole returned 2.26% Cu and 0.11 oz/ton Au . Very limited follow up was conducted on the massive sulphide intercepts and no drill follow up was completed on the copper gold occurrence detected in the bottom of the RC hole. The southern portion of the property is interpreted to be underlain by ultramafic volcanics from limited drilling and magnetic data; this area of the property is thought to be a prospective for nickel-copper sulphides. (Reference: Alamo Petroleum Assessment File, R.S. Middleton P.Eng. 1975)\nIn late March of 2021, Pelangio received preliminary results from an airborne VTEM Plus electromagnetic survey and magnetic survey. The survey outlined a large (1 km by 1.5 km) moderate VTEM response on the flank of a large magnetic anomaly (see Figure 5). In October of 2021, Pelangio completed an induced polarization survey over the central portion of anomaly to define priority drill targets within the broad anomaly. The field data has just been received and processing of the data and interpretation is under way. A drill program for this project is fully funded and will be initiated after a review of the data.\nFigure 5: Gowan VTEM Response and Compilation Map\nQualified Persons\nMr. Kevin Thomson, P.Geo.

In February 2020, 5.7 million Americans were without a job, while now it is 9.3 million. It means that the labor market is still far from recovery . Or, actually, given all the generous unemployment benefit supplements introduced during the pandemic, the new equilibrium unemployment rate may be simply higher than in the past.\nImplications for Gold\nAnyway, the new employment situation report is positive for the gold market . May nonfarm payrolls report is disappointingly weak and missed expectations for the second month in a row. It means that the April report wasn\u2019t just an accident, and the US labor market has to face some serious problems.\nThe sad truth is that Americans don\u2019t want to work. Even the decline in the unemployment rate was caused to a large extent by the drop in the labor participation rate, as workers just left the labor market. This fact explains why employers report worker shortages despite an army of a few million unemployed people. According to the recent Fed\u2019s Beige Book , many companies have difficulties finding new employees, so they had to boost their wages to attract candidates:\nIt remained difficult for many firms to hire new workers, especially low-wage hourly workers, truck drivers, and skilled tradespeople (\u2026) A growing number of firms offered signing bonuses and increased starting wages to attract and retain workers.\nEven the BLS admitted that \u201crising demand for labor associated with the recovery from the pandemic may have put upward pressure on wages\u201d. Indeed, wage increases accelerated to 2% in May year-over-year, up from just 0.4% in the previous month. They could add to the inflationary pressure or reduce companies\u2019 margins and investments, reducing the pace of real economic growth. So, the jump in wages seems to be good for gold . Hence, the yellow metal could continue its long-term upward trend after the recent pullback below $1,900 (see the chart below).",

Markets are rising, and that, as Stoltzfus says, \u201c\u2026in our view likely presents more opportunity than risk for investors who have suitable tolerance for risk and who practice patience.\u201d Taking Stoltzfus\u2019 outlook into consideration, we wanted to take a closer look at two stocks earning a round of applause from Oppenheimer's stock analysts. Using TipRanks\u2019 database, we learned that both share a profile: a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street\u2019s analyst corps and a reliable dividend yielding at least 8%. Let\u2019s see what Oppenheimer has to say about them. Owl Rock Capital (ORCC) We\u2019ll start with Owl Rock Capital, one of the financial industry\u2019s myriad specialty finance companies. These companies generally inhabit the middle-market finance sector, where they make available capital for acquisitions, recapitalizations, and general operations to mid-market companies that don\u2019t necessarily have access to other sources of credit. Owl Rock\u2019s portfolio consists of investments in 119 companies, totaling $11.3 billion. Of these investments, 96% are senior secured loans. Owl Rock reported its 4Q20, and full year results, at the end of February. The company saw Q4 net income of $180.7 million, which came out to 46 cents per share. This was up from 36 cents per share in 4Q19, a 27% increase. Also up was investment income, which at $221.3 million for the quarter was up 9% year-over-year. Full-year investment income was $803.3 million, up more than 11% from 2019. In addition, the company finished 2019 with over $27 billion in assets under management. Of particular interest to dividend investors, Owl Rock\u2019s board declared a 31-cent per common share dividend for the first quarter. This is payable in mid-May, and matches the company\u2019s previous regular dividend payments. The annualized rate of $1.24 gives a yield of 9%. Also of interest about Owl Rock\u2019s dividend, the company paid out the sixth and final special dividend \u2013 related to the 2019 IPO launch \u2013 in this past December. In 2019, ORCC paid out for 80 cent special dividends, along with the regular dividend payments. The company has kept its dividend reliable, meeting both the regular and special payments, since going public in the summer of 2019. Owl Rock caught the attention of Oppenheimer\u2019s Mitchel Penn, who sees the company as a solid investment with potential to beat the estimates. \"We estimate EPS of $1.22 and $1.34 in 2021 and 2022 for an ROE of 8% and 9%, respectively. We project that Owl Rock can earn a 8.5% ROE, and given an estimated cost of equity capital of 8.5% we calculate a fair value of $15/share or 1.02x book value,\" Penn noted. \"To achieve an 8.5% ROE, ORCC will either need to increase its portfolio yield from 8.4% to 9.0% or increase its leverage from 1x to 1.2x. It\u2019s also possible that it does a little of both. Our model accounts for the fee expense increase from a flat 75 bps to a base fee of 1.5% on assets and an incentive fee of 17.5% on income.\" Penn rates this stock an Outperform (i.e., a Buy), and his $15 price target suggest a 7% upside potential from current levels. The dividend yield, however, is the true attraction here (To watch Penn\u2019s track record, click here.) ORCC shares have attracted 3 recent reviews, and all are to Buy \u2013 which makes the Strong Buy consensus rating unanimous. This stock is selling for $13.98 per share and has an average price target of $14.71. (See ORCC stock analysis on TipRanks) Fidus Investment Corporation (FDUS) Sticking with the mid-market finance sector, we\u2019ll take a look at Fidus Investment. This company, like Owl Rock, offers capital access to smaller firms, including access to debt solutions. Fidus has a portfolio that is based mainly on senior secured debt, along with mezzanine debt. The company that Fidus has invested in are valued between $10 million and $150 million. In the fourth quarter, rounding out 2020, Fidus invested in seven companies new to its portfolio, putting a total of $103.9 million into the investments. The company\u2019s portfolio, for that quarter, brought in an adjusted net investment income of $10.7 million, or 25 cents per common share. This was up 3 cents, or 13%, year-over-year. For the full year 2020, the adjusted net income reached $38 million, up from $35.3 million in 2019. Per share, 2020\u2019s $1.55 was up 7.6% yoy. Fidus\u2019 shares have been climbing steadily in the past year. Since last April, the stock has gained an impressive 153%. This gives FDUS a solid share appreciation, to complement the dividend returns. Those dividends are substantial. The company declared its 1Q21 payment in February, and paid out on March 26. The regular payment, at 31 cents per common share, yields 8% with an annualized payout of $1.24. In addition to this regular payment, Fidus also declared a special dividend of 7 cents per share, nearly double the 4-cent special payment made in the previous quarter. Turning now to the Oppenheimer coverage on Fidus, we find that 5-star analyst Chris Kotowski is pleased with this company, enough to rate it an Outperform (i.e. Buy) with an $18 price target. This figure suggests a 15% one-year upside. (To watch Kotowski\u2019s track record, click here) \u201cThe fundamentals [are] stable with debt investments at year-end essentially stable and interest income in line with both the prior quarter and our estimate\u2026. What we are most pleased about is that we ended the year with only one small non-accrual. There was a significant loss during the year on one credit, which was crystallized in 4Q20, but there were also equity gains in 1Q20 that offset that, and in our mind, the fact that we end a year like this with minimal net losses validates FDUS's business model.\u201d Of Fidus\u2019 dividend policy, maintaining a base payment with special dividends added on when possible, Kotowski writes simply, \u201cWe think a variable dividend makes a world of sense.\u201d Like ORCC above, this is a stock with a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating based on 3 recent positive reviews. Fidus\u2019 shares are selling for $15.70 and their $17.17 average price target indicates a 9% upside potential from that level.

(\"Alpha\" or the \"Company\") previously announced that it has become a reporting issuer in the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario (see Alpha News Release dated October 14, 2021), and the Company is now pleased to provide an update to recent activity on its Kerkasha Project in Eritrea.\nMichael Hopley, Alpha President and CEO said, \"The Alpha exploration team have been very busy over the past few months with advancing exploration work on three important Prospects on the Kerkasha Exploration License. Now that the Company is a reporting issuer in Canada, we will be providing shareholders with regular updates on the very active Kerkasha exploration work program.\"\nAnagulu Copper-Gold Porphyry Prospect\nAnagulu is a large area of porphyry-style copper-gold-silver mineralization located in the southwest part of the Kerkasha License. It is a virgin discovery by Alpha geologists with the discovery hole drilled in January 2020. Assay results from the discovery hole (diamond hole AND001) showed an interval of 49m with an average grade of 2.42 g/t gold, 1.10% copper and 6.83 g/t silver. Subsequent drilling has shown zones of similar strength mineralization although over narrower intercepts found within wider zones of lower grade gold and copper mineralization. (See Alpha website for more specific details at www.alpha-exploration.com).\nGeophysical Surveys\nRecent work at the Anagulu Prospect has included a detailed Induced Potential (\"IP\") and Resistivity geophysical survey using 100m line spacings. The previous IP-resistivity survey used a 200m line spacing. This more detailed survey was considered necessary to help identify the more discrete, higher-grade IP anomalies associated with higher grade mineralization seen in some of the previous drilling. This work consisted of approximately 24 line km of survey covering an area measuring 2km by 1.5 km. A report and interpretation of the datasets from this survey are expected from Southern Geoscience Consultants (Perth, Australia) before the end of November 2021.\nA ground magnetic survey at the Anagulu prospect is planned in November 2021. The gold-copper mineralisation has magnetite associated with it and it is hoped a magnetic survey will assist in targeting high-grade zones of mineralisation at depth.\nDrilling\nIn July-August 2021, Alpha completed a third phase of drilling at Anagulu consisting of 14 drill holes totaling 3,038 meters of reverse-circulation and diamond drilling. All these holes were mostly focused on extending the known high-grade gold/copper mineralization found in diamond holes AND001 and ANDOO5 to the northeast, as well as testing some peripheral geophysical anomalies.\nAburna Gold Prospect\nThe Aburna Prospect is located approximately 7kms north of Anagulu and exploration on the prospect has only recently commenced. Gold at Aburna was mined in the 1920's by Italian colonial miners and more recently by local artisanal miners. Reconnaissance exploration by Alpha staff has shown the gold mineralization to be associated with at least 3 NE-SW oriented shear zones and to extend over at least a 6 km strike length from the historic Italian gold mine (See Alpha website for more specific details www.alpha-exploration.com).\nRock-Chip Sampling\nReconnaissance rock chip sampling at outcrops of interest in the first half of 2021, returned some very encouraging assays results for gold. To follow-up on this initial prospecting and with the objective of defining early drill targets, the latest work by Alpha geologists has consisted of the taking 1-meter sub-surface channel and trench samples in over 60 locations across the strike of the earlier high-grade rock chip locations. Assay results are not yet available from this work but are expected to be received in the next 2 to 3 weeks. In addition, consultant structural geologist Dr. Ghislain Tourigny has been conducting detailed mapping at Aburna since early October 2021, to assist in defining the controls to gold mineralisation and siting the locations for a 'first pass' drill program later in Q4 2021.\nTolegimja Copper, Gold, Zinc VMS Prospect\nThe Tolegimja Prospect is a copper--zinc-gold volcanogenic massive sulphide (\"VMS\") Prospect located in the northeast part of the Kerkasha License and a virgin discovery by Alpha geologists. Surface rock chip and soil sampling has shown strong copper and zinc mineralization over approximately 3kms strike length within what is considered a classic geological VMS setting (see Alpha website for more details www.alpha-exploration.com).\nGeophysical Surveys\nA detailed IP-Resistivity survey consisting of 68-line kms covering an area of approximately 7.2km\u00b2, was completed by independent contractors at Tolegimja in July-September 2021. The object of the work was to define targets for drill testing in Q4 2021. A full report on this survey with recommendations is expected from independent geophysical consultant Southern Geoscience in November 2021.\nAfter detailed mapping of this Prospect by consultant structural geologist Dr. Ghislain Tourigny in November 2021, Alpha is planning the first drilling program at Tolegimja in Q4 2021.\nKona West Copper-Gold Prospect\nThe Kona West Prospect is located in the north-central part of the Kerkasha License and was discovered by Alpha geologists while executing a property-wide soil sampling program.\nGeophysical Surveys\nA detailed IP survey consisting of 14-line km covering an area of approximately 1.5km\u00b2 was completed by independent contractors over the Kona West prospect in June-July 2021. The object of the work was to define targets for drill testing in Q4 2021. A full report on this survey with recommendations is expected from independent geophysical consultant Southern Geoscience in November 2021.\nAbout Alpha\nAlpha is a company focused on the discovery of world class economic gold & base metals deposits in the highly prospective Arabian-Nubian shield that runs on either side of the Red Sea. Alpha's currently holds a 100% interest in the large (1,028 km\u00b2) Kerkasha Exploration License in southwest Eritrea, located 135 km west-southwest of the capital city of Asmara. Since acquiring the property in January 2018, the company has spent approximately CAD$10 million on exploration and identified 18 Prospects of which 4 have been drilled to date. The large Anagulu copper-gold porphyry system was a virgin discovery by Alpha geologists in early 2018, that was made while executing a property-wide soil geochemical sampling program. The discovery diamond hole was drilled in January 2020 and reported a 49m interval with an average grade of 2.42 g/t gold, 1.10% copper and 6.83 g/t silver. Work continues at Anagulu, and 4 other prospects are expected to be drilled later this year.\nAlpha is managed by a group of highly experienced and successful professionals with many years of experience carrying out exploration and resource development programs in Eritrea and Sudan.\nAs previously announced, Alpha has recently become a reporting issuer in the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario and the Company expects to be trading on the TSX-V during the week of October 25, 2021 under the symbol ALEX.\nMichael Hopley President and Chief Executive Officer Alpha Exploration Ltd.

Over the past several months, raw material costs such as steel, copper, and plastics have trended higher along with logistics and transportation costs. The ability to maintain our capital budget during this period of increasing global inflationary pressures is a testament to the work and preparedness of the Orezone team and our consulting engineers. It is also a reflection of the high quality of the 2019 FS as our bulk material quantities such as earthworks, steel, piping, and platework are all trending favourably to those estimated in the 2019 FS. We will be posting monthly video updates of progress to keep our shareholders and stakeholders fully informed of all ongoing construction activities over the next year.\u201d\nHighlights\nBulk quantities tracking 2019 feasibility study: Engineering is now over 60% complete and progressing on schedule. All bulk quantities for the project remain at or within the estimates in the 2019 FS.\nMajor orders made prior to global materials cost inflation: The Company, together with its engineering consultants, completed detailed reviews and optimization studies during 2020 to ensure a smooth start to detailed engineering and procurement at the award of the EPCM contract. This facilitated rapid tendering and procurement of the major process plant equipment. Firm orders have now been placed for most mechanical and electrical equipment including the ball mill, CIL agitators, CIL inter-tank screens, mineral sizer, apron feeder, vibrating screens, slurry pumps, all gold recovery circuit equipment, and high voltage switchgear and transformers. Orders for major bulk items such as HDPE membranes and geotextiles, HDPE piping, concrete rebar, tank platework, and all major structural steel have also been placed.\nMajor construction contracts awarded: Contracts have been awarded for the Plant Concrete, CIL Tank Erection, and Overland and Tailing Pipeline Installation. Tenders for the plant Structural/Mechanical/Piping (\u201cSMP\u201d) are under evaluation and will be awarded in the coming weeks. This leaves only the Electrical & Instrumentation installation contract which will be the final major site installation package and will follow the award of the SMP but is generally the lowest cost of these 4 major contracts. To date, all contracts are trending on budget.\nSite earthworks and site infrastructure: Early civil works to provide year-round access to all construction areas including additional camp upgrades to meet peak occupancy, the construction of the Nobsin River haul road bridge, clearing and grubbing of the tailings storage facility (\u201cTSF\u201d), the process plant footprint, and the mine access roads are now complete. Construction of the TSF will commence in August.\nPlant Power: The power purchase agreement (\u201cPPA\u201d) signed providing life of mine LNG and solar generated power for the Phase I oxide plant (see news release dated June 2, 2021).\nMining of the Off-Channel Reservoir (\u201cOCR\u201d): This contract was awarded to a local mining contractor and mobilization commenced in February 2021 with the first bench mined in March 2021. The OCR is the first ore pit to be mined and will also function as the main water storage for the project during operations and be available to the surrounding communities after mine closure. The OCR is expected to be completed before the onset of the 2022 rainy season in June. Mining is progressing very well with costs and material movement tracking to plan.\nMining and Resource Reconciliation\nPrior to commencing mining of the OCR, a detailed 20,000 metre grade control drilling program was undertaken. Results have been incorporated into the block model and reconciliation on both tonnes and grade compared to the 2019 FS for the OCR has been positive. Overall, the reserve tonnes and ounces are approximately 30% above those estimated in the 2019 FS. Grade control drilling will now focus on the Maga and Maga Hill pit areas which will be the source of the planned higher-grade ore feed to the process plant in the first 1 to 2 years of gold production.\nOrezone Gold Corporation (TSX.V: ORE OTCQX: ORZCF) is a Canadian development company which owns a 90% interest in Bombor\u00e9, one of the largest undeveloped gold deposits in Burkina Faso.\nThe 2019 feasibility study highlights Bombor\u00e9 as an attractive shovel-ready gold project with forecasted annual gold production of 118,000 ounces over a 13+ year mine life at an All-In Sustaining Cost of US$730/ounce with an after-tax payback period of 2.5 years at an assumed gold price of US$1,300/ounce. Bombor\u00e9 is underpinned by a mineral resource base in excess of 5 million gold ounces and possesses significant expansion potential. Orezone is fully funded to bring Bombor\u00e9 into production with the first gold pour scheduled for Q3-2022.\nPatrick Downey President and Chief Executive Officer\nIan Chang, P.

Results are subsequent to the most recent published Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (\"MRMR\") statements (31, December 2019 and 30, May 2020 for Turmalina and Pilar respectively). Drilling results reported in this release and from on-going and planned 2021 exploration programs will be included in Jaguar's next National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report MRMR update planned for early 2022.\nConsolidated Jaguar Proven and Probable Reserves as at 31, December 2020 (net of 2020 mined depletion) totalled 478 koz's of gold (3.64Mt at an average weighted grade of 4.08 g/t Au).\nIn-fill diamond drilling competed in 2020 from ongoing programs at both mines, within and beyond the current published Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve limits, continue to confirm lateral and depth extensions to the known, currently exploited mineralization at grades and thicknesses consistent with current and historical levels.\n(Detailed MRMR tabulations for both Turmalina and Pilar Mines to 31, December 2020 may be found in the company's Annual Information Form (AIF) published on SEDAR and dated 15, March 2021 and on the Company's website at www.jaguarmining.com.)\nVern Baker, CEO, Jaguar Mining commented; \"Our geology team has done an outstanding job providing the sustainable resources our mines need to grow and prosper. Diamond drilling success within our mines continues to build the resources that provide both sustainability and potential for growth. Jaguar has increased its in-mine diamond drilling metres over the last 18 months to provide increasing our MRMR and delivering a foundation for sustainability and long-term growth. I am very pleased to see results at higher levels in the mine, such as the Turmalina intercept of 22 g/t over 8.8m, located at C-Central near level five. This strong zone extension bodes well for sustaining our performance going forward.\nJaguar is committed to generating cash flow, that will allow us to invest in the future of our company and provide strong returns to shareholders. We applaud the exploration and geology teams' dedication to ensure the foundation of our success continues to support our future performance. As previously stated, we will not be completing a full technical report to update the MRMR in 2021, however, we will continue to support exploration programs for resources within our mines. We expect to fully update the MRMR in early 2022 which may include additional mineral resources from other exploration properties in the Iron Quadrangle where we have ongoing exploration programs.\"\nTurmalina and Pilar Mine Drilling Results - 2020 / 2021\nAt Turmalina and Pilar, infill diamond drilling progressed throughout 2020 and is currently continuing. To date, drilling has been aimed at Mineral Resource to Mineral Reserve conversion across all production areas.\nAt Turmalina, growth exploration drilling has focused on new resource additions at shallow levels in the mine, primarily targeting the C-Orebody structure from C-Central towards the C-NW area (Figures 1 and 3). In 2021 growth exploration drilling will be aimed at extending the A-Orebody to a depth well beyond the current level 12-level production panel.\nResults continue to reflect grades and thickness consistent with current and historical mine resources. Drilling which reported grade thickness (GT) values greater than 20 g/t completed at Turmalina during 2020 are included in Table 1 below and presented in Figures 1. and 1A (All results reported from 2020 drilling are tabulated within the latest AIF Report (15, March 2021, on SEDAR).\nAt Pilar, growth exploration drilling has focused on new resource additions at shallower levels in the mine, primarily targeting the SW - Orebody. In 2021 growth exploration drilling will target additions to Pilar's life of mine by drilling both the lateral extensions of mineralization close to existing infrastructure throughout the mine, in order to add productivity, while extending the high-grade structurally controlled Banded Iron Formation hosted mineralization to depths well beyond the current level 12- level and 14 production levels (Figures 2 and 4).\nResults continue to reflect grades and thickness consistent with current and historical mine resources. Drilling which reported grade thickness values greater than 25 g/t, completed at Pilar since June 2020 are included in Table 2 and are presented in Figure 2. (All results reported from 2020 drilling are tabulated within the latest AIF Report (15, March 2021 on SEDAR).\nTable 1 - Turmalina Mine - Drill Results showing intersections reporting greater than 20 g/t metres (GT) Orebody A and Orebody C.\n| Jaguar Mining Inc. -

Samples are selected for analysis in standard intervals according to geological characteristics such as lithology and hydrothermal alteration. Rock channel sampling of the underground development follows the same standard intervals as for the drill core.\nHalf of the sawed sample is forwarded to the analytical laboratory for analysis while the remaining half of the core is stored in a secure location. The drill core and rock chip samples for resource-reserve conversion and grade control samples are transported for physical preparation and analysis in securely sealed bags to the Jaguar in-house laboratory located at the company\u00b4s Caet\u00e9 Complex, Caet\u00e9, Minas Gerais. Growth exploration samples are sent to the independent ALS Brazil (subsidiary of ALS Global) laboratory located in Vespasiano, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The analysis of these exploration samples is conducted at ALS Global's respective facilities (fire assay is conducted by ALS Global in Lima, Peru, and multi-elementary analysis is conducted by ALS Global in Vancouver, Canada). ALS has accreditation in a global management system that meets all requirements of international standards ISO/IEC 17025:2005 and ISO 9001:2015. All major ALS geochemistry analytical laboratories are accredited to ISO/IEC 17025:2005 for specific analytical procedures.\nFor a complete description of Jaguar's sample preparation, analytical methods and QA/QC procedures, please refer to \"Technical Report on the Ro\u00e7a Grande and Pilar Operations, Minas Gerais State, Brazil\", a copy of which is available on the Company's SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com.\nThe drilling results presented on this news release are from drill holes completed by contractors Major Drilling and Jaguars own fleet of underground diamond drilling rigs.\nFor a complete description of Jaguar's sample preparation, analytical methods and QA/QC procedures, please refer to the \"Technical Report on the Ro\u00e7a Grande and Pilar Operations, Minas Gerais State, Brazil\", dated August 17th 2020, a copy of which is available on the Company's SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com.\nAbout Jaguar Mining Inc.\nJaguar Mining Inc. is a Canadian-listed junior gold mining, development, and exploration company operating in Brazil with two gold mining complexes and a large land package with significant upside exploration potential from mineral claims covering an area of approximately 102,000 hectares.

Forward-looking statements and information are provided for the purpose of providing information about management's expectations and plans relating to the future. All of the forward-looking information made in this news release is qualified by the cautionary statements below and those made in our other filings with the securities regulators in Canada. Forward-looking information contained in forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \"are expected,\" \"is forecast,\" \"is targeted,\" \"approximately,\" \"plans,\" \"anticipates,\" \"projects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"continue,\" \"estimate,\" \"believe\" or variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results \"may,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"might,\" or \"will\" be taken, occur or be achieved. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, may be considered to be or include forward-looking information. This news release contains forward-looking information regarding, among other things, expected sales, production statistics, ore grades, tonnes milled, recovery rates, cash operating costs, definition/delineation drilling, the timing and amount of estimated future production, costs of production, capital expenditures, costs and timing of the development of projects and new deposits, success of exploration, development and mining activities, currency fluctuations, capital requirements, project studies, mine life extensions, restarting suspended or disrupted operations, continuous improvement initiatives, and resolution of pending litigation. The Company has made numerous assumptions with respect to forward-looking information contained herein, including, among other things, assumptions about the estimated timeline for the development of its mineral properties; the supply and demand for, and the level and volatility of the price of, gold; the accuracy of reserve and resource estimates and the assumptions on which the reserve and resource estimates are based; the receipt of necessary permits; market competition; ongoing relations with employees and impacted communities; political and legal developments in any jurisdiction in which the Company operates being consistent with its current expectations including, without limitation, the impact of any potential power rationing, tailings facility regulation, exploration and mine operating licenses and permits being obtained and renewed and/or there being adverse amendments to mining or other laws in Brazil and any changes to general business and economic conditions. Forward-looking information involves a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including among others: the risk of Jaguar not meeting the forecast plans regarding its operations and financial performance; uncertainties with respect to the price of gold, labour disruptions, mechanical failures, increase in costs, environmental compliance and change in environmental legislation and regulation, weather delays and increased costs or production delays due to natural disasters, power disruptions, procurement and delivery of parts and supplies to the operations; uncertainties inherent to capital markets in general (including the sometimes volatile valuation of securities and an uncertain ability to raise new capital) and other risks inherent to the gold exploration, development and production industry, which, if incorrect, may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by the Company and described herein. In addition, there are risks and hazards associated with the business of gold exploration, development, mining and production, including environmental hazards, tailings dam failures, industrial accidents and workplace safety problems, unusual or unexpected geological formations, pressures, cave-ins, flooding, chemical spills, procurement fraud and gold bullion thefts and losses (and the risk of inadequate insurance, or the inability to obtain insurance, to cover these risks). In addition, the Company's principal operations and mineral properties are located in Brazil and there are additional business and financial risks inherent in doing business in Brazil as compared to the United States or Canada. In Brazil, corruption represents a challenge requiring extra attention by those who conduct business there. Corruption does not only occur with the misuse of public, government or regulatory powers, it also can occur in a business's supplies, inputs and procurement functions (such as illicit rebates, kickbacks and dubious vendor relationships) as well as the inventory and product sales functions (such as inventory shrinkage or skimming). Employees as well as external parties (such as suppliers, distributors and contractors) have opportunities to commit theft, procurement fraud and other wrongs against the Company. While corruption, bribery and fraud and theft risks can never be fully eliminated, the Company reviews and implements controls to reduce the likelihood of these events occurring. The Company's present and future business operations face these risks. Accordingly, for all of the reasons above, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking information.\nFor additional information with respect to these and other factors and assumptions underlying the forward-looking information made in this news release, see the Company's most recent Annual Information Form and Management's Discussion and Analysis, as well as other public disclosure documents that can be accessed under the issuer profile of \"Jaguar Mining Inc.\" on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. The forward-looking information set forth herein reflects the Company's reasonable expectations as at the date of this news release and is subject to change after such date. The Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, other than as required by law. The forward-looking information contained in this news release is expressly qualified by this cautionary statement.\nAppendix 1\nDrill hole location data for Turmalina holes reported in this

What happens after prices return to their recent lows could prove interesting; or downright discouraging if you are expecting a resumption of the trend to higher prices.\nSilver at its recent reaction high point yesterday reached $24.80. At that point it was still down $5.00 per ounce from it August intraday high of $29.80. When silver touched $21.80 last week it represented a loss of more than twenty-five percent from its August peak.\nGold\u2019s percentage changes are more moderate but still, at its recent low of $1760, gold was down three hundred dollars per ounce from its August peak.\nSo, what can we expect ahead? Below is a chart (source) of silver prices for the past one hundred years.\nBetween July 1982 and April 1983, a period of only nine months, the price of silver tripled from just under $5 per ounce to almost $15 per ounce. Can you imagine the froth associated with that move?\nSilver had fallen ninety percent from an intraday high of $49 per ounce to an intraday low of $4.90 per ounce over the preceding two years. What seemed like the beginning of a new uptrend in silver prices was not that at all, however.\nAfter topping at $14.67 per ounce, the price of silver began a three-year slide culminating with a low of $4.85. That decline completely erased the tripling of prices that had occurred.\nThen, silver began another \u201cnew uptrend\u201d which took prices to almost $11.00 less than a year later. It didn\u2019t last long, though, as silver almost immediately began moving lower. Four years later in 1991, silver had broken to new subsequent lows at $3.55.\nAnother example of silver\u2019s \u201cflash-in-the-pan\u201d performance happened more recently. After reaching its price peak of $49 in April 2011, silver fell to a low of $13.70 in December 2015.\nBarely seven months later, in July 2016, silver was up to $20.70, an increase of more than fifty percent. Over the next four years, silver fell forty-three percent to a subsequent new low of $11.77 in April 2020.\nWHAT ABOUT GOLD?\nBelow is a chart (source)of gold prices for the past one hundred years\u2026\nMovements in gold prices are seemingly similar to silver. Gold prices, however, do not reflect the wide-eyed fantasy that underlies most of the the bullish sentiment for silver. Higher gold prices reflect the ongoing loss in purchasing power of the US dollar, which takes place over decades; therefore, changes in its price are much less extreme than those in silver.",

        "full_text": "Argonaut Gold Announces Major Milestone of Magino Closure Plan Filing\nTORONTO, Jan. 21, 2021 /CNW/ - Argonaut Gold Inc. (TSX: AR) (the \"Company\", \"Argonaut Gold\" or \"Argonaut\") is pleased to announce that the province of Ontario has filed the Closure Plan for the Magino project. Site preparation, such as tree removal and clearing, is expecting to commence imminently, with construction scheduled to begin as soon as site preparation is complete. Argonaut envisions a two-year construction period with first gold production at Magino during the first half of 2023.\nPete Dougherty, President and CEO stated: \"The filing of the Closure Plan is a significant milestone and allows us to begin site preparation activities for construction of the Magino mine and processing facility. Magino is truly a valuable and strategic asset given existing infrastructure, the already-known mineral endowment of the ore body and the existing exploration potential, its location within the mining-friendly jurisdiction of Ontario, Canada and its proximity to other strong cash flowing operations such as the Island Gold mine. By moving Magino forward, we are executing on our vision to transform Argonaut from a junior, relatively high-cost producer with short mine lives to an intermediate, lower-cost producer with long mine lives.\"\nKyle Stanfield, Director of Environment and Community Relations commented: \"We are humbled by the tremendous community support that has enabled this important project milestone to pass. We will continue to coordinate closely with our Indigenous and Municipal partners as we develop this investment into a world class mining operation.\"\nThe Magino project has received incredible stakeholder support locally, provincially and federally, as well as strong shareholder support to see the project move forward. The Magino project initial capital estimate of between C$480 million and C$510 million, of which approximately 40% is covered by a fixed-bid contract with Ausenco Engineering Canada Inc., is considered fully financed through Argonaut's current cash balance and anticipated cash flow from operations assuming a gold price environment at or above US$1,600 per ounce. At December 31, 2020, Argonaut had US$214 million in cash and also has access up to US$125 million through its existing revolving credit facility, which is fully undrawn.\nThe Magino Feasibility Study demonstrated that the Magino project is a strategic, scalable, long-life asset in the attractive mining jurisdiction of Ontario, Canada. Highlights from the Magino Feasibility Study include:\nA 10,000 tonne per day processing facility;\nAverage annual gold production of 150,000 ounces over the first five years;\nA 17-year mine life;\nCash cost of US$669 per gold ounce sold*; and\nAll-in sustaining cost of US$711 per gold ounce sold*.\n* | See Non-IFRS Measures Section |\nFor further information on the Magino project, please see the report as listed below on the Company's website or on www.sedar.com:\nMagino Gold Project | Feasibility Study Technical Report on the Magino Project, Ontario, Canada dated December 21, 2017 (effective date November 8, 2017) |\nNon-IFRS Measures\nThe Company has included certain non-IFRS measures including \"Cash cost per gold ounce sold\" and \"All-in sustaining cost per gold ounce sold\" in this press release. Cash cost per gold ounce sold is equal to production costs less silver revenue divided by gold ounces sold. All-in sustaining cost per gold ounce sold is equal to production costs less silver revenue plus general and administrative expenses, exploration expenses, accretion of reclamation provision and sustaining capital expenditures divided by gold ounces sold. The Company believes that these measures provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate the performance of the Company. Non-IFRS measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"). Therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies. The data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Please see the most recent management's discussion and analysis for full disclosure on non-IFRS measures.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements\nThis press release contains certain \"forward-looking statements\" and \"forward-looking information\" under applicable Canadian securities laws concerning the business, operations and financial performance and condition of Argonaut Gold Inc. (\"Argonaut\" or \"Argonaut Gold\"). Forward-looking statements and forward-looking information include, but are not limited to statements with respect to the realization of mineral reserve estimates; the timing and amount of estimated future production; costs of production; estimated production and mine life of the various mineral projects of Argonaut; permitting and legal processes in relation to mining permitting and approval; the benefits of the development potential of the properties of Argonaut; the future price of gold, copper, and silver; the estimation of mineral reserves and resources; success of exploration activities; and currency exchange rate fluctuations. Except for statements of historical fact relating to Argonaut, certain information contained herein constitutes forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are frequently characterized by words such as \"plan,\" \"expect,\" \"project,\" \"intend,\" \"believe,\" \"anticipate\", \"estimate\" and other similar words, or statements that certain events or conditions \"may\", \"should\" or \"will\" occur. Forward-looking statements are based on the opinions and estimates of management at the date the statements are made, and are based on a number of assumptions and subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Many of these assumptions are based on factors and events that are not within the control of Argonaut and there is no assurance they will prove to be correct.\nFactors that could cause actual results to vary materially from results anticipated by such forward-looking statements include variations in ore grade or recovery rates, changes in market conditions, risks relating to the availability and timeliness of permitting and governmental approvals; risks relating to international operations, fluctuating metal prices and currency exchange rates, changes in project parameters, the possibility of project cost overruns or unanticipated costs and expenses, labour disputes and other risks of the mining industry, failure of plant, equipment or processes to operate as anticipated.\nThese factors are discussed in greater detail in Argonaut's most recent Annual Information Form and in the most recent Management's Discussion and Analysis filed on SEDAR, which also provide additional general assumptions in connection with these statements. Argonaut cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not exhaustive. Investors and others who base themselves on forward-looking statements should carefully consider the above factors as well as the uncertainties they represent and the risk they entail. Argonaut believes that the expectations reflected in those forward-looking statements are reasonable, but no assurance can be given that these expectations will prove to be correct and such forward-looking statements included in this press release should not be unduly relied upon. These statements speak only as of the date of this press release.\nAlthough Argonaut has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to be anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Argonaut undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change except as required by applicable securities laws. The reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Statements concerning mineral reserve and resource estimates may also be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements to the extent they involve estimates of the mineralization that will be encountered if the property is developed. Comparative market information is as of a date prior to the date of this document.\nAbout Argonaut Gold\nArgonaut Gold is a Canadian gold company engaged in exploration, mine development and production. Its primary assets are the El Castillo mine and San Agustin mine, which together form the El Castillo Complex in Durango, Mexico, the La Colorada mine in Sonora, Mexico and the Florida Canyon mine in Nevada, USA.

        "summary": "By Nakul Iyer (Reuters) - Gold slipped to its lowest in over two months on Wednesday as surging U.S. Treasury yields and a firmer dollar continued to take a toll on the metal. Spot gold was down 0.2% at $1,790.90 per ounce by 1244 GMT, having hit its lowest since Dec. 1 at $1,782.40 earlier in the day after dropping 1.3% in the previous session. U.S. gold futures fell 0.5% to $1,789.70. \"Gold markets seem to be fixated on U.S. yields,\" Natixis analyst Bernard Dahdah said. \"While there is an amazing amount of liquidity, we are going out of lockdowns and we are expecting growth to go back to normal levels,\" he added, noting that given such optimism investors had little interest in the safe-haven metal.

        "full_text": "By Nakul Iyer\n(Reuters) - Gold slipped to its lowest in over two months on Wednesday as surging U.S. Treasury yields and a firmer dollar continued to take a toll on the metal.\nSpot gold was down 0.2% at $1,790.90 per ounce by 1244 GMT, having hit its lowest since Dec. 1 at $1,782.40 earlier in the day after dropping 1.3% in the previous session.\nU.S. gold futures fell 0.5% to $1,789.70.\n\"Gold markets seem to be fixated on U.S. yields,\" Natixis analyst Bernard Dahdah said.\n\"While there is an amazing amount of liquidity, we are going out of lockdowns and we are expecting growth to go back to normal levels,\" he added, noting that given such optimism investors had little interest in the safe-haven metal.\nGrowing expectations for inflation spurred benchmark U.S. Treasury yields to their highest since late February 2020. The surge in yields in turn prompted the dollar to rebound from a three-week low, further pressuring gold.\nBreakeven inflation, a measure of expected inflation, is at its highest since August 2014 at 2.2%.\nWhile gold is seen as an inflation hedge, higher inflation expectations have pushed yields up, increasing the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding gold.\nProgress on a $1.9 trillion U.S coronavirus relief plan, as President Joe Biden built support for the bill that includes $1,400 stimulus checks, further drove yields up.\nBut gold could come back into favour once other currencies start to outperform the U.S. dollar later this year, said OANDA analyst Craig Erlam, adding that the metal could scale the levels seen in November, December and January, when it pushed above $1,900.\nInvestors are also looking forward to the minutes of the Federal Reserve's end-January monetary policy meeting due on Wednesday.\nPlatinum, used in catalytic converters for vehicles, fell 2.5% to $1,230.36, well below Tuesday's high of $1,336.50, a peak since September 2014.\nPalladium declined 0.8% to $2,364.03, while silver eased 0.3% to $27.14.\n(Reporting by Nakul Iyer in Bengaluru; Editing by Mark Potter and Jan Harvey)",

(TSXV: GRSL) (OTCQB: GRSLF) (FRANKFURT: GPE) (\"GR Silver Mining\" or the \"Company\") \u2013 is pleased to announce that it has initiated a 14,000 m exploration drill program targeting newly identified and untested silver-gold (Ag-Au) veins on its concessions within the Rosario Mining District, Sinaloa, Mexico. Seven drill rigs are being mobilized to undertake this program at new project sites on the Company's extensive Ag-Au vein systems that extend over structural trends covering a combined 75 km strike length of the Plomosas, San Marcial and La Trinidad Project Areas (Figure 1).\nAfter successful completion of the resource drill programs at the Plomosas Mine Area and the San Juan Area (both within the Plomosas Project), exploration efforts are now focused on testing Au and Ag-rich veins that have seen little or no exploration activity. While the program includes previously identified veins, several of the targets to be drilled are new discoveries identified by the Company's mapping and prospecting teams.\nAmong the recently discovered epithermal vein and breccia targets to be tested are the GAP Area system, which connects the San Marcial and San Juan areas, and also Au-rich epithermal mineralization identified to the south of the Plomosas Mine Area (\"Plomosas South\"). The first two rigs have commenced a 16-hole drill program at Plomosas South that provides step-out extension potential to the resource estimate currently underway on the Plomosas Mine Area.\nThe GAP Area was covered by the recently completed NW extension of the San Marcial ground geophysical (IP and magnetometry) program (see News Release dated February 22, 2021), extending from the San Marcial Project northwesterly to the San Juan Area (Figure 1).\nAnother new area that is being prepared for drilling is the Loma Dorada structure, an epithermal Au vein target which is on the northern extension of the La Colorada vein system, where the Company recently released high grade results from LCS21-04 containing 0.65 m at 10,777 g/t AgEq (see News Release dated June 10, 2021). A significant mapping and drill program has commenced at the El Saltito vein system in the western portion of the Plomosas concessions. Further details on specific programs at the new drill target sites will follow.\nGR Silver Mining VP Exploration, Honza Catchpole commented, \"We are excited to commence this new phase of our exploration program after the successful conclusion of the resource drilling at the Plomosas Mine and San Juan Areas. With the mobilization of seven rigs, we can now begin to test new Ag-Au vein targets that we have had our eyes on for some time. Our goal is to test a series of new project drill sites that can prove we are dealing with an expansive Ag- and Au-rich system of veins and hydrothermal breccias. Additionally, we aim to connect the proven mineralized structures of the Plomosas and San Marcial Projects by filling the geological gaps in places where we have already mapped important vein structures on surface. We expect our new drilling program to significantly expand the strike length of our vein system in the key structural trends\".\nQualified Person\nThe scientific and technical data contained in this News Release related to the exploration program was reviewed and/or prepared under the supervision of Honza Catchpole, P. Geo. He has approved the disclosure herein.\nAbout GR Silver Mining Ltd.\nGR Silver Mining Ltd. is Mexico-focused Company engaged in cost-effective silver-gold resource expansion on its 100%-owned assets which lie on the eastern edge of the Rosario Mining District, in the southeast of Sinaloa State, Mexico.\nPlomosas Silver Project\nGR Silver Mining's 6,574 ha Plomosas Silver Project is located near the historic mining village of La Rastra and within 5 km of the Company's San Marcial Silver Project, in the Rosario Mining District. The Project is a past-producing asset where only one mine, the Plomosas lead-zinc(-silver-gold) underground mine, operated a 600 tpd crush-mill-flotation circuit from 1986 to 2001, producing approximately 8 M ounces of silver, 73 M pounds of lead and 28 M pounds of zinc.\nThe March 2020 acquisition of the Plomosas Silver Project included 563 historical and recent drill holes from both surface and underground locations. These drill holes represent an extensive database allowing the Company to advance towards resource estimation and potential project development in the near future.\nThe Company is completing a drilling program with surface holes focused on expanding known mineralization along strike in two areas, the Plomosas Mine Area and the San Juan Area. Underground drilling included in the program is targeting the extension of recent Au-rich discoveries at the lowest level (775 m RL, or ~250 m below surface) of the Plomosas Mine Area and six low sulphidation epithermal veins at the San Juan Area. Both areas are currently the subject of NI 43-101 resource estimations.\nThe assets include all facilities and infrastructure including access roads, surface rights agreement, water use permit, 8,000 m of underground workings, water access, 60 km - 33 KV power line, offices, shops, 120-person camp, infirmary, warehouses and assay lab representing approximately US$30 M of previous capital investments. The previous owners invested approximately US$18 M in exploration, including extensive geophysics and geochemistry programs.\nThe silver-gold mineralization on this Project displays the alteration, textures, mineralogy and deposit geometry characteristics of a low sulphidation epithermal silver-gold-base metal mineralized vein/breccia system. Previous exploration was focused on polymetallic (Pb-Zn+/-Ag-Au) shallow mineralization, hosted in NW-SE structures in the vicinity of the Plomosas Mine. The E-W portion of the mineralization and extensions of the main N-S Plomosas Fault remain under-explored.\nSan Marcial Project\nSan Marcial is a near-surface, high-grade silver-lead-zinc open pit-amenable project. The Company filed a National Instrument 43-101 (\"NI 43-101\") report entitled \"San Marcial Project Resource Estimation and Technical Report, Sinaloa, Mexico\" having an effective date of March 18, 2019 and an amended date of June 10, 2020 (the \"Report\"), which contains a 36 Moz AgEq (Indicated) and 11 Moz AgEq (Inferred) resource estimate. The Report was prepared by Todd McCracken and Marcelo Filipov of WSP Canada Inc. and is available on SEDAR. The company recently completed over 320 m of underground development in the San Marcial Resource Area, from which underground drilling is planned to expand the high-grade portions of the resource down-dip. The Company recently discovered additional mineralization in the footwall, outside of the existing resource, and will also be drilling this area. GR Silver Mining is the first company to conduct exploration at San Marcial in over 10 years.\nRecent exploration has identified silver and gold mineralization in areas previously defined as non-mineralized, discovering evidence of pervasively altered rocks with intense silicification, veining and associated wide, silver and gold mineralized zones on the footwall of the NI 43-101 resource area.\nLa Trinidad Project\nThe La Trinidad Project was acquired in March 2021. While La Trinidad has been the focus of artisanal mining activity over many decades, commercial operations began late in the 20th century. Anaconda Minerals Corp. was first to drill the project in the mid-late 1980s. After initially taking up an option on the Project in 1993, Eldorado Gold Corp. then commenced an open pit gold mine at La Trinidad in 1995, known as the Taunus Pit, with ore being processed via a heap leach operation. The mine operated until 1998, producing approximately 52,000 oz of gold1.\nExploration undertaken by Oro Gold from 2006 identified additional resources below the Taunus Pit and operations recommenced late in 2014. Gold output from the heap leach pads continued until late 2019 for a total cumulative production by Oro Gold of 112,000 oz gold2,3. In addition to La Trinidad, the portfolio acquired by GR Silver Mining includes an extensive regional database of geological, geochemical and geophysical information resulting from historical exploration expenditure by Oro Gold of more than CDN$18.6 M since 2006.\nCimarron Project\nCimarron is another advanced stage project that was acquired along with the La Trinidad Project in March 2021 and is located 40 km to the NW of La Trinidad. A number of targets have been identified at Cimarron including Calerita, El Prado, Huanacaxtle, Betty and Veteranos, however Calerita is the only target to have been drilled to date. The near surface historical Inferred Resource at the Calerita prospect contains 3.7 Mt at 0.65 g/t Au for approximately 77,000 oz of gold4, which is considered to be open along strike and down dip.\nWhile the 2011 resource is considered by GR Silver Mining to be a historical resource, the Company considers the resource estimate as being relevant and reliable, considering a lack of significant additional exploration work since its release. A key parameter in the historical resource is the usage of a US$1,200/oz gold price compared to a much higher current spot gold price. A Qualified Person (QP) would be required to review the historical resource report and make recommendations in order to verify and upgrade it to a current resource. A QP has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current mineral resources. The Company is treating the 2011 resource estimate as a historical estimate. The company plans to re-assess the work completed by previous owners and define the feasibility of additional drilling, aiming at identifying additional near-surface mineralization.\nThe Plomosas, San Marcial and La Trinidad Projects collectively represent a geological setting resembling the multi-million-ounce San Dimas Mining District which has historically produced more than 600 Moz Ag and 11 Moz Au over a period of more than 100 years.\n_____________________ | |\n1 | Refer to Marlin Gold Mining Ltd. 2nd Amended NI 43-101 Technical Report dated February 1, 2013 |\n2 | Refer to Marlin Gold Mining Ltd.

Following the acquisition of Marlin Gold Mining Ltd. (\"Marlin\") in March 2021, GR Silver Mining controls a concession portfolio of over 1,000 km2, two previously producing mines fully permitted for future developments and a total combined 75 km of structures with field evidence of 24 Ag-Au veins in historic old workings.\nGR Silver Mining Ltd.\nMr. Marcio Fonseca, P.

(gold equivalent ounces), with additional upside opportunities. Kinross\u2019s record cash flow has increased the company\u2019s financial strength.\nStrong production and disciplined cost and capital management\nThe combination of strong production, disciplined cost and capital management, and a strong gold price appears to have led to outstanding financial results in fiscal 2020. Adjusted operating cash flow increased by 59% over the previous year, while free cash flow grew to over $1 billion, a six-fold increase compared with 2019.\nContinued prospects for strong cash flow\nFurther, Kinross\u2019s attributable margins increased by 53% to $1,051 per ounce sold, outpacing the increase in the average realized gold price of 27%. Kinross\u2019s adjusted net earnings appears to have more than doubled to approximately $970 million. Given the strength of Kinross\u2019s financial position, and continued prospects for strong cash flow, the company instituted a sustainable quarterly dividend of $0.03 per share.\nInvestment-grade balance sheet\nAlso, Kinross has continued to strengthen the company\u2019s investment grade balance sheet, ending the year with just over $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents, compared with $575 million at the end of 2019, and with total liquidity of approximately $2.8 billion. Kinross ended 2020 well positioned to fund the company\u2019s growth and continues to reduce debt and return capital to shareholders.\nRobust pipeline of development projects and opportunities\nWith Kinross\u2019s growing production profile and costs trending downwards, the company expects to have a peer-leading free cash flow yield over the next three years. Kinross also has a robust pipeline of development projects and opportunities. Kinross has successfully advanced the company\u2019s portfolio of low-risk development projects in 2020 while expanding the project pipeline with attractive new opportunities in the company\u2019s existing jurisdictions.",

It is anticipated that WAC&G will complete a non-brokered private placement prior to completion of the Proposed Private Placement (the \"Pre-RTO Financing\") in May, 2021 of approximately 606 WAC&G Shares, at a price of C$5,714.29 (US$4,500) per WAC&G Share, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately C$3,462,857.14 (US$2,727,000), based upon a foreign exchange ratio of 0.7875 US dollars for every Canadian dollar. Following the completion of the Pre-RTO Financing, it is anticipated that WAC&G will have approximately 3,189 WAC&G Shares issued and outstanding on a fully diluted basis.\nWAC&G owns the rights in and to the assets and claims in the Illinois Creek Project (the \"Project\") which is comprised of the Illinois Creek claim block, the Round Top claim block and the Honker claim block, totaling 222 State of Alaska mining claims and covering 35,520 acres (14,374 ha), or 55.5 square miles. The Project is 100% owned by WAC&G.\nBD Resource Consulting, Inc. has prepared a technical report in respect of the Project dated effective January 15, 2021, which report is compliant with National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (the \"NI 43-101 Report\").\nAbout the Project\nThe Illinois Creek claim block is one of three properties controlled by WAC&G in the Illinois Creek mining district located in western Alaska near the Yukon River. WAC&G is a private exploration company registered in Alaska and, since 2010, it has been exploring and advancing its interests in the district. Exploration of the properties began in the early 1980's by Anaconda Minerals Co., then by Echo Bay, USMS/Dakota Mining and NovaGold. The Illinois Creek Mine was permitted by USMX in 1996 and started production as a run-of-mine heap leach open pit mine in 1997. It closed soon after due to low gold prices and was reclaimed in 2002.\nIllinois Creek is an advanced stage project with drilling, geophysical and geochemical surveys by several past operators. Extensive drilling, at total of 578 diamond and reverse circulation drill holes, at the Illinois Creek Property has targeted the oxidized gossans and, to a far lesser extent, the Waterpump Creek carbonate replacement deposit (CRD) and Last Hurrah CRD. Only minimal exploration has targeted the remainder of the Property, and the potential to find additional mineralized zones is considered by WAC&G to be very good.\nTable 6.7 from the 43-101 Report summarizes the mineral resource delineation and exploration drill campaigns on the Property between 1980 and 2006 conducted by the previous operators of the Property.\nDrill Campaigns 1980-2006 at Illinois Creek\n| Company | Years | # Core | # RC | Core | RC | Total |\n| Anaconda | 1980-1984 | 73 | 18 | 10,132.7 | 2,266.1 | 12,398.8 |\n| Goldmor | 1988-1990 | 1 | 87 | 16.8 | 2,914.0 | 2,930.8 |\n| NPMC | 1991-1992 | 42 | 0 | 3,089.4 | 0.0 | 3,089.4 |\n| Echo Bay | 1993 | 0 | 166 | 0.0 | 18,739.5 | 18,739.5 |\n| USMX | 1994-1995 | 65 | 78 | 4,657.9 | 5,054.3 | 9,712.2 |\n| Viceroy | 1999 | 0 | 23 | 0.0 | 731.6 | 731.6 |\n| ARG | 2002 | 5 | 0 | 215.3 | 0.0 | 215.3 |\n| NovaGold | 2005-2006 | 20 | 0 | 2,746.8 | 0.0 | 2,746.8 |\n| Total | 206 | 372 | 20,858.9 | 29,705.5 | 50,564.4 |\nThe 43-101 Report indicates the following:\nMineral Resource Estimate for Combined\nIn-Situ and Leach Pad Mineral Resources\n| Class | Tonnes | Average Grade | Contained Metal | ||||||\n| AuEq | Au | Ag | Cu | AuEq | Au | Ag | Cu | ||\n| Indicated | 8.7 | 1.33 | 0.90 | 34.4 | 0.21 | 373 | 253 | 9.6 | 40 |\n| Inferred | 3.3 | 1.44 | 0.99 | 36.2 | 0.21 | 152 | 104 | 3.8 | 15 |\nIn-Situ Mineral resources are stated as contained within a pit shell developed using a metal prices of US$1,600/oz Au and US$20/oz Ag, mining costs of US$2.50/t, processing costs of US$10/t, G&A cost of US$4.00/t, 92% metallurgical recovery Au, 65% metallurgical recovery Ag and an average pit slope of 45 degrees. The cut-off grade for resources considered amenable to open pit extraction methods is 0.35 g/t AuEq. It is assumed that the entire volume of the material on the leach pad will be processed and therefore, no selectivity is possible, and the Leach Pad Mineral Resources are presented at a zero-cut-off grade.\nThe technical information in this news release has been prepared and approved by Bruce Davis, BD Resource Consulting, Inc., Larkspur, Colorado and Robert Sim, SIM Geological Inc., Vancouver, B.C. and Jack DiMarchi, Core Geoscience and Deepak Mulhotra, Pro Solve LLC, Denver , Colorado., two of the authors of the NI 43-101 Technical Report prepared in respect of the Project by BD Resource Consulting, Inc. and dated effective January 15, 2021 (the \"NI 43-101 Report\"), and each a qualified person within the meaning of National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (the \"QPs\"). Such QPs have no beneficial interest in WAC&G or the Project and are not insiders, associates, or affiliates of WAC&G. The results of the Technical Report were not dependent on any prior agreements concerning the conclusions of the Technical Report, and there are no undisclosed understandings concerning future business dealings between WAC&G and the QPs. The authors of the Technical Report were paid a fee for their work in accordance with normal professional consulting practices. The Technical Report noted that Piek Exploration had conducted two 5% data verification checks of the assay and collar databases. In both instances, only two errors in the assay values were encountered and those appeared to be transcription errors. The QPs randomly selected the sample data from 15 drill holes, representing about 4% of the data using in the estimate of in-situ mineral resources. The grades in these holes were compared to those contained in the certified assay certificates provided by the laboratories. In this suite of 818 individual samples, there were four errors found in the gold data and three errors in the silver data. These results are similar to those achieved during previous database audits. The sample data from an additional four drill holes from the leach pad area were randomly selected, and the assay results were compared to the values contained in the assay certificates. There were no errors identified. The QPs believe the database meets industry standards for data quality and data integrity and that sample preparation, security, and analytical procedures are adequate to support a mineral resource estimation.\nSummary of Proposed Transaction and Concurrent Financing\nTransaction Structure\nThe Letter of Intent provides that 779 and WAC&G will negotiate and enter into a definitive agreement in respect of the Proposed Transaction (the \"Definitive Agreement\") as soon as possible. The Proposed Transaction is expected to be completed by way of a merger of WAC&G and a wholly-owned subsidiary of 779 (\"SubCo\"), pursuant to a Plan of Merger in accordance with the Alaska Corporations Code, or such other alternative structure to be determined, having regard to relevant tax, securities and other factors, which will result in WAC&G becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of 779.\nIn connection with the Proposed Transaction, 779 will amend and restate its Notice of Articles (the \"Article Amendment\") to create two classes of shares, common shares of 779 (the \"779 Common Shares\") and proportional voting shares of 779 (\"779 Proportional Voting Shares\"), which will convertible subject to certain conditions, into 779 Common Shares on the basis of approximately one hundred (100) 779 Common Shares for each 779 Proportional Voting Share (depending on their status as U.S. residents). The shareholders of WAC&G will receive either 779 Common Shares or 779 Proportional Voting Shares in exchange for their WAC&G Shares, resulting in a reverse takeover of 779 by WAC&G. Entering into of the Definitive Agreement is conditional upon 779 and WAC&G each being satisfied with the results of full financial, business, legal, environmental, labour and other due diligence investigations in respect of the other party.\nFor the purposes of the Proposed Transaction, each outstanding share of WAC&G held by a non-US resident shall be exchanged for approximately ten thousand (10,000) 779 Common Shares and each outstanding share of WAC&G held by a US resident shall be exchanged for approximately one hundred (100) 779 Proportional Voting Shares. In addition, all outstanding WAC&G options will be exchanged for options of 779 on the basis of approximately ten thousand (10,000) options of 779 for each WAC&G option.\nPrior to the completion of the Proposed Transaction, 779 shall consolidate, as required, the 3,075,000 779 Shares which will be outstanding at that point in time (the \"779 Consolidation\") based upon a ratio to be determined immediately prior to the closing of the Proposed Transaction so that the current holders of 779 Shares shall hold, in the aggregate, such number of 779 Common Shares that, when multiplied by the offering price of the Concurrent Financing (as defined below), are equal to no less than C$1,132,500 (the \"779 Share Value\"). In the event that the offering price of the Concurrent Financing is greater than $0.75 per share, then the 779 Share Value shall be increased proportionately. In addition, in connection with the Proposed Transaction, 779 will change its name to \"Western Alaska Copper & Gold Company\" or such other name as may be determined by 779 and WAC&G.\nCertain common shares of the Resulting Issuer to be issued pursuant to the Proposed Transaction are expected to be subject to restrictions on resale or escrow under the policies of the Exchange, including the securities to be issued to \"Principals\" (as defined under Exchange policies), which will subject to the escrow requirements of the Exchange.\nThe Proposed Transaction is subject to, among other things, the negotiation and execution of the Definitive Agreement, each of 779 and WAC&G being satisfied with the results of its due diligence review of the other party, completion of the Concurrent Financing for aggregate gross proceeds of not less than C$2,000,000 and that such Concurrent Financing meets the listing requirements of the Exchange, WAC&G owning all of the rights and interests in and to the Project, the Resulting Issuer meeting the requirements of the Exchange for a Tier 1 mining issuer and the Exchange issuing conditional acceptance, such only to customary conditions of closing, for the listing of the Resulting Issuer Shares, that the Resulting Issuer will be a \"foreign private issuer\" under US securities laws, and each of the parties obtaining all necessary board, shareholder and regulatory approvals, including the conditional approval of the Exchange, and other standard closing conditions. The Proposed Transaction will be subject to the approval of the 779 shareholders, which 779 anticipates it will obtain by way of unanimous written consent resolutions. The terms and conditions of the Proposed Transaction may change based on 779's due diligence (which will be limited as the 779 intends to rely upon the due diligence conducted by the Exchange and the agents involved with the Concurrent Financing) and the receipt of tax, corporate and securities law advice for both 779 and WAC&G.\nOn completion of the Proposed Transaction, the Resulting Issuer is expected to qualify as a Tier 1 mining issuer on the Exchange.\nConcurrent Financing\n779 intends to complete a non-brokered private placement offering (the \"Concurrent Financing\")of subscription receipt (the \"Subscription Receipts\") for aggregate gross proceeds of not less than C$2,000,000 at an offering price to be determined. In connection with the completion of the Proposed Transaction, each Subscription Receipt shall automatically convert, with no further action on behalf of the holder, into a Resulting Issuer Share. The net proceeds of the Private Placement will be placed into escrow and released to the Resulting Issuer, subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions including that all conditions precedent to the closing of the Proposed Transaction shall be satisfied or waived.\nWAC&G intends to use the net proceeds of the Concurrent Financing to fund the exploration of the Project, pay for expenses of the Concurrent Financing and Proposed Transaction, and for general working capital purposes.\nThe securities to be offered in the Proposed Transaction and Concurrent Financing have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"U.S. Securities Act\") or any U.S. state securities laws, and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. Persons (as defined in Rule 902(k) of Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act) or persons in the United States, absent registration or applicable exemptions from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable U.S. state securities laws.

Mismatch repair is a process that corrects mismatches generated during DNA replication, recombination, and damage. Deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) causes an inability to correct DNA replication errors, allowing mutations to continue throughout the genome, particularly in regions of repetitive DNA known as microsatellite, which can lead to MSI-H.8\n\"This is excellent news for colorectal cancer patients with MSI-H/dMMR tumours,\" says Barry D. Stein, a colon cancer survivor and president of Colorectal Cancer Canada. \"This drug is encouraging because it can help some patients achieve a better quality of life and more time with family and loved ones. Innovative treatment options, like this one, are helping to make a difference for Canadians facing this particular colon cancer.\"\nAbout KEYNOTE-177 Trial\nHealth Canada's approval for CRC is based on findings from the Phase 3 study KEYNOTE-177, a multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial conducted in 307 patients with previously untreated metastatic MSI-H or dMMR CRC.9 Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive 200 milligrams (mg) of KEYTRUDA\u00ae intravenously every three weeks or chemotherapy regimens given intravenously every two weeks.10\nThe results of KEYNOTE-177 showed that KEYTRUDA\u00ae demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in progression free survival (PFS) compared to patients treated with chemotherapy.11 The median PFS in patients treated with KEYTRUDA\u00ae was 16.5 months compared to 8.2 months in the chemotherapy arm (HR=0.60 [95% CI, 0.45-0.80]; p=0.0002).12 The average objective response rate (ORR) for the KEYTRUDA\u00ae arm was 44% compared to 33% in the chemotherapy arm, and the average duration of response at 24 months was 83% in the KEYTRUDA\u00ae arm versus 35% in the chemotherapy arm.13\n\"The approval of KEYTRUDA\u00ae as a first-line treatment for metastatic MSI-H or dMMR colorectal cancer marks its nineteenth indication, reinforcing Merck's ongoing commitment to science and to the research and development in immuno-oncology,\" says AnnA Van Acker, President, Merck Canada. \"We hope that this new treatment option will have a meaningful impact for those Canadians who live with MSI-H/dMMR colorectal cancer. We are devoted to our straightforward mission and to continue all relentless efforts to help more Canadians living with cancer.\"\nAbout Colorectal Cancer\nColorectal cancer occurs when the cells lining the rectum or colon become abnormal and begin to divide rapidly, resulting in the development of benign tumours.14 Over time, the DNA of the benign tumours can change, causing the tumours to become cancerous.15 This can result in the cancer spreading to the blood and lymph vessels, further allowing it to metastasize and reach other organs such as the lungs or liver.16 Since there is no clear border between the colon and rectum and they are made of the same tissues, they are categorized together as CRC.17 As most CRC cases are related to aging, over 90% of cases occur in patients over the age of 50.18 Over half (56%) of CRC cases are expected to occur in Canadians who fall within the age covered by Canadian screening guidelines (50 to 74 years), while approximately 7% of colorectal cancer cases are expected to be diagnosed in people younger than 50 years of age.19\nAbout KEYTRUDA\u00ae\nKEYTRUDA\u00ae is an anti-PD-1 therapy that works by helping increase the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumour cells.20 KEYTRUDA\u00ae is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumour cells and healthy cells.21\nKEYTRUDA\u00ae was first approved in Canada in 2015 and currently has 19 indications in several disease areas, including advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), bladder cancer, non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), melanoma and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).22\nMerck's Research Program\nMerck has the industry's largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 750 trials studying pembrolizumab across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. This clinical program seeks to understand the role of pembrolizumab across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with this medication, including exploring several different biomarkers.\nOur Focus on Cancer\nOur goal is to translate progressive science into innovative oncology medicines to help people with cancer worldwide. At Merck Oncology, helping people fight cancer is our passion and supporting accessibility to our cancer medicines is our commitment. Our focus is on pursuing research in immuno-oncology and we are accelerating every step in the journey \u2014 from lab to clinic \u2014 to potentially bring new hope to people with cancer.\nAbout Merck\nFor more than 125 years, Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, has been inventing for life, bringing forward medicines and vaccines for many of the world's most challenging diseases in pursuit of our mission to save and improve lives. We demonstrate our commitment to patients and population health by increasing access to health care through far-reaching policies, programs and partnerships. Today, Merck continues to be at the forefront of research to prevent and treat diseases that threaten people and animals \u2014 including cancer, infectious diseases such as HIV and Ebola, and emerging animal diseases \u2014 as we aspire to be the premier research-intensive biopharmaceutical company in the world.

According to CNBC, the spot gold price is up 0.4 per cent to US$1,883 an ounce. Weakness in the US dollar and bond yields drove the gold price higher.\nIron Ore: It could be another difficult day for iron ore producers after the iron ore price continued to sink. According to Metal Bulletin, the spot iron ore price is down a further 4.1 per cent to US$192.42 a tonne. Ever-growing political tensions and an iron ore price scaling $200 per tonne has so far not prevented China taking Australia's exports of the red metal in record amounts.\nCrypto: Bitcoin prices steadied to rise by more than 11 per cent, after the largest cryptocurrency by market cap endured an extended streak of selling over the weekend.

Two said the gold would be shipped in April and two said it would arrive over April and May.\nThe bulk of China's gold imports typically comes from Australia, South Africa and Switzerland.\nThe People's Bank of China (PBOC), the country's central bank, controls how much gold enters China through a system of quotas given to commercial banks. It usually allows metal in but sometimes restricts flows.\n\"We had no quotas for a while. Now we are getting them ... the most since 2019,\" said a source at one of the banks moving gold into China.\nThe PBOC did not respond to a request for comment.\nThe size of the shipments signals China's dramatic return to the global bullion market. Since February 2020, the country has on average imported gold worth about $600 million a month, or roughly 10 tonnes, Chinese customs data show.\nIn 2019, its imports ran at about $3.5 billion a month, or roughly 75 tonnes.\nChina's absence made little difference to gold prices early in the pandemic when Western investors fearful of economic catastrophe stockpiled vast amounts of the safe-haven asset, pushing it to a record high of $2,072.50 an ounce.\nBut the investor interest drifted away as vaccines and government stimulus programmes revived economic growth and gold prices have sagged to around $1,750 an ounce.\nIndia's demand for bullion has also rebounded from a pandemic-induced slump, with record-breaking imports in March of 160 tonnes of gold, an Indian government source told Reuters this month.",

To the upside, the 50 day EMA above will offer resistance, just as the 200 day EMA is sitting just above the $1800 level, both of which could offer selling opportunities. Alternately, if we break down below the bottom of the recent lows, then the market is likely to go looking towards the $1500 level.\nLooking at this chart, it is obvious that we see a lot of bullish noise from time to time, but longer-term we have been dropping over the last several months. That has been more than a 20% drop, and as a result I think we are more than likely going to continue to see bearish pressure more than anything else. However, if the US dollar does turn around completely, then it is possible that gold would take off.\nFor a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our economic calendar.\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire",

(\"ITH\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: ITH) (NYSE-MKT: THM) today announced the results of the Pre-Feasibility Study (the \"PFS\") for its Livengood Gold Project (the \"Project\") located near Fairbanks, Alaska. The PFS details a project that would process 65,000 tons per day and produce 6.4 million ounces of gold over 21 years from a gold resource estimated at 13.6 million ounces at 0.60 g/tonne. The PFS utilized a third-party review by Whittle Consulting and BBA Inc. to integrate new interpretations based on an expanded geological database, improved geological modelling, new resource estimation methodology, an optimized mine plan and production schedule, additional detailed metallurgical work at various gold grades and grind sizes, changes in the target grind for the mill, new engineering estimates, and updated cost inputs, all of which significantly de-risk the Project. The PFS has estimated the capital costs of the Project (\"CAPEX\") at US$1.93 billion, the total cost per ton milled (\"OPEX\") at US$13.12, the all-in sustaining costs (\"AISC\") at US$1,171 per ounce, and an after-tax NPV(5%) of US$400 million at $1,800/oz, US$975 million at US$2,000/oz, and US$2.3 billion at $US2,500/oz.\n\"This PFS confirms that the Livengood Gold Project is the one of the largest, highly leveraged gold projects in North America. This study is the culmination of years of work and greatly enhances our understanding of the deposit. We have now thoroughly evaluated, optimized, and de-risked all major elements of the Project and have an excellent foundation on which to build shareholder value. International Tower Hill's estimated 13.6 million ounces, together with our favorable jurisdiction and proximity to infrastructure, offers our investors great leverage to the gold price,\" said Karl Hanneman, CEO.\nThe Company invites you to attend a conference call and webcast hosted by CEO Karl Hanneman to discuss the Company and this news release.\nConference Call & Webcast Details:\nDate: | November 5, 2021 at 12:00 pm ET |\nWebcast: | |\nNorth American callers: | 1-877-270-2148 |\nInternational callers: | 1-412-902-6510 |\nPre-Feasibility Study Overview\nThe Project configuration evaluated in the PFS is a conventional, owner-operated surface mine that will utilize large-scale mining equipment in a blast/load/haul operation. Mill feed would be processed in a 65,000 tons per day comminution circuit consisting of primary and secondary crushing, wet grinding in a single semi-autogenous (SAG) mill and single ball mill followed by a gravity gold circuit and a conventional carbon in leach (CIL) circuit.\nWhittle Enterprise Optimization\nPrior to beginning the PFS, the Company retained Whittle Engineering and BBA Engineering to collaborate on an enterprise optimization study (the \"Whittle and BBA Study\") to review various technologies and project configurations and to recommend the optimum configuration for the PFS. The Whittle and BBA Study reviewed secondary crushing with SAG and ball mill, tertiary crushing with ball mill, gravity/CIL at P80 of 90 micron to 250 micron, stand-alone and auxiliary heap leach configurations, gravity only gold recovery, gravity/flotation with pressure oxidation and CIL of flotation concentrate. These configurations were evaluated at various combinations of project ramp up strategy, annual throughput, primary, secondary, and tertiary grind size, as well as mining fleet size and stockpile management strategies. Tailings technologies reviewed included conventional tailings and pressure filtered tailings.\nThe Whittle and BBA Study determined that the gravity/CIL plant at P80 250 micron with conventional tailings provided the highest NPV, which is the configuration detailed in the PFS.\nPre-Feasibility Study Summary\nThe PFS was prepared by independent third-party consultants and provides information on the optimized Project with higher throughput, an updated resource estimate, and capital and operating cost estimates as compared to the project evaluated in the National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\") April 2017 Technical Report (the \"2017 Report\"). The final version of the NI 43-101 technical report containing the PFS will be filed on SEDAR within 45 days. As a result of the changes to the Project as evaluated in the PFS, including differences in the mineral resource estimation methodology and changes to the economic parameters applied to the geologic block model (gold price, recovery, CAPEX, and OPEX), all of which resulted in a change in the mineral resources, the Project as evaluated in the 2017 Report is no longer considered current and the 2017 Report should therefore not be relied upon by investors.\nThe Company cautions that the PFS is preliminary in nature, and is based on technical and economic assumptions which would be further refined and evaluated in a full feasibility study. The PFS is based on an updated Project mineral resource estimate effective as of August 20, 2021 using a different mineral resource model than what was used in the 2017 Report.\nThe following is a summary of the material aspects and assumptions of the PFS. Investors are urged to review the complete NI 43-101 report following its filing on SEDAR for complete details of the PFS.\nThe engineering design to estimate capital costs used in the PFS are within a -20%/+25% accuracy.\nProject Location\nThe Project is connected by an existing paved highway to the city of Fairbanks, 70 miles to the southwest in central Alaska. The Project is located in an active mining district that has been mined for gold since 1914. The State of Alaska land use plan designates mining as the primary surface land use for the area in which the Project is located. Employees would be bussed daily to the site from Fairbanks.\nInfrastructure\nThe Project would include a lined tailings management facility, an administration office/shop/warehouse complex, and would also include construction of a 50-mile 230kV electrical transmission line to the mine site from the existing grid power near Fairbanks, Alaska.\nEnvironmental and Community Relations\nTwelve continuous years of baseline environmental work continues to indicate that all aspects of the Project can be successfully and safely managed. The design of the tailings facility incorporates best practices including a lined rock fill structure with a lined tailings basin. The Project development team has considerable experience working with Alaska's large mine permitting process and has a proven and respected track record of developing mining projects safely and in an environmentally sound manner. The Project has already and will continue to provide local economic opportunities with local access to a highly skilled and available work force. The Company is also working to seek early input on the Project and to explore ways to maximize economic benefits to the local communities.\nSummary of Results of the 65,000 Tons Per Day PFS\nOPERATING METRICS | 2021 PFS | ||\nMill Throughput | 65,000 | tons/day | |\nHead Grade \u2013 Year 1-5(1) | 0.79 | g/tonne | |\nHead Grade \u2013 LOM(1) | 0.65 | g/tonne | |\nGold Recovery \u2013 LOM | 71.4 | % | |\nMine Life | 21 | years | |\nTotal Ounces Produced | 6,430,178 | Troy ounces | |\nAverage Annual Production \u2013 Year 1-5 | 388,600 | Troy ounces | |\nAverage Annual Production \u2013 LOM | 306,200 | Troy ounces | |\nTotal Ore Processed | 474 | Million tons | |\nTotal Waste(2) | 547 | Million tons | |\nAnnual Mining Rate | 52 | Million tons | |\nWaste Rock to Mill Ore (ton) Ratio \u2013 LOM during production | 0.98:1 | Waste to Ore | |\nWaste Rock to Mill Ore (ton) Ratio \u2013 LOM | 1.15:1 | Waste to Ore | |\nLow Grade Stockpile \u2013 Total Placed/Maximum Size | 105/88 | Million tons | |\n(1) Diluted grade | |||\n(2) Includes 84 million tons pre-production | |||\nFINANCIAL METRICS | 2021 PFS | US$ | |\nCAPEX \u2013 Initial | 1.93 | $Billion | |\nCAPEX \u2013 Sustaining | 658 | $Million | |\nReclamation & Closure | 322 | $Million | |\nOPEX \u2013 Mining | 2.05 | $/ton mined | |\nOPEX \u2013 Processing | 7.72 | $/ton ore | |\nOPEX \u2013 General &Administrative (G&A) | 1.35 | $/ton ore | |\nOPEX - Operating Cost \u2013 Year 1-5 | 887 | $/Ounce | |\nOPEX - Operating Cost \u2013 LOM | 1,068 | $/Ounce | |\nAll-In Sustaining Cost of Production \u2013 Year 1-5 | 1,038 | $/Ounce | |\nAll-In Sustaining Cost of Production \u2013 LOM | 1,171 | $/Ounce | |\nGold Price Sensitivity Analysis\nThe following table shows the average annual free cash flow and EBIDTA generated by the Project at various gold prices.\n(US$M) | FREE CASH FLOW | EBIDTA | ||\nGold Price | Average Annual | Average Annual | Average Annual | Average Annual |\n$1,500 | $159 | $108 | $229 | $142 |\n$1,680 PFS | $225 | $154 | $296 | $197 |\n$1,800 | $269 | $184 | $342 | $234 |\n$2,000 | $332 | $232 | $417 | $295 |\n$2,500 | $482 | $349 | $605 | $449 |\nThe following table shows the after-tax economics at various gold prices.\nGold Price ($/Oz) | AFTER TAX | AFTER TAX | IRR (%) | Payback (Years) |\n$1,500 | $202 | ($512) | 1.00% | 16.2 |\n$1,680 (PFS Base | $1,137 | $45 | 5.30% | 10.4 |\n$1,800 | $1,741 | $400 | 7.70% | 8.2 |\n$2,000 | $2,729 | $975 | 11.20% | 6.3 |\n$2,500 | $5,102 | $2,351 | 18.50% | 3.9 |\nCapital Costs\nKey capital expenditures for initial and sustaining capital requirements are identified in the following table.\nUS$ Million | ||\nDescription | Initial | Sustaining |\nProcess Facilities | $433 | |\nInfrastructure Facilities | 459 | $514 |\nPower Supply | 87 | |\nMine Equipment | 200 | 139 |\nMine Development | 230 | |\nOwners Costs | 296 | 5 |\nContingency | 220 | |\nTotal | $1,925 | $658 |\nRounding of some figures may lead to minor discrepancies in totals.\nAll-in Sustaining Costs\nThe table below highlights the all-in sustaining costs and the all-in cost over the life of the Project:\nYear 1-5 | LOM | |||||\nUS$/Ounce | US$ Million | US$/Ounce | US$ Million | |||\nOperating Costs | $887 | $1,724 | $1,068 | $6,870 | ||\nSustaining Capital Expenditures | 151 | 292 | 102 | 658 | ||\nAll-In Sustaining Costs(1) | $1,038 | $2,016 | $1,171 | $7,529 | ||\nCapital Expenditures (2) (3) | 0 | 0 | 299 | 1,925 | ||\nFunding of Reclamation Trust Fund (4) | 30 | 58 | 42 | 268 | ||\nAll-In Costs(1) | $1,068 | $2,075 | $1,512 | $9,722 | ||\nRounding of some figures may lead to minor discrepancies in totals. | ||||||\n(1) All-In Sustaining Costs and All-In-Costs are non-IFRS | (3) Excludes US$40 million of recoverable initial stores |\n(2) Includes initial capital expenditures only. | (4) Total US$322 million estimated costs. |\nAnnual Gold Production\nThe chart below highlights the anticipated production schedule.

These Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves formed the basis of the economic evaluation of the Project and are based on a gold price of US$1,680 per ounce. The economic assumptions and parameters used for the calculation of reserves are the same as those used for the PFS financial model. Note that tonnages presented are in the metric system.\nLivengood Gold Project Mineral Reserve Estimate\nClassification | Tonnes (Mt) | Au (g/tonne) | Contained Au |\nProven | 411.5 | 0.64 | 8,492 |\nProbable | 18.5 | 0.86 | 512 |\nTotal P & P | 430.1 | 0.65 | 9,004 |\n(1) Mineral Reserves are reported using the 2014 CIM Definition Standards and are estimated in accordance with 2019 CIM Best Practices Guidelines.\n(2) Mineral Reserves are estimated using a gold price of US$1,680 per ounce, and consider a 3% royalty, 1.80/oz for smelting, refining, and transportation costs, and a gold payable of 99.9%\n(3) Metallurgical recovery curves were developed for each rock type, with the Mineral Reserves having the following tonnage weighted averages; 83.3%, for Rocktype 4, 79.8% for Rocktype 5, 73.5% for Rocktype 6, 66.4% for Rocktype 7, 58.7% for Rocktype 8 and 57.1% for Rocktype 9, including 22% for massive stibnite mineralization.\n(4) As a result of the complex metallurgical recovery equations, it is difficult to determine specific cut-off grades. The following presents the lowest gold grades for each rocktype that are processed in the life of mine plan; 0.26 g/t for Rocktype 4, 0.28 g/t for Rocktype 5, 0.31 g/t for Rocktype 6, 0.31 g/t for Rocktype 7 and 0.42 g/t for Rocktype 8 and 0.42 g/t for Rocktype 9.\n(5) The strip ratio for the open pit is 1.2 to 1.\n(6) The Mineral Reserves are inclusive of mining dilution and ore loss.\n(7) The reference point for the Mineral Reserves is the primary crusher.\n(8) Totals may not add due to rounding.\n(9) The foregoing mineral reserves are based upon and are included within the current mineral resource estimate for the Project.\nProject Mineral Resources\nThe mineral resource estimates set forth in the PFS (\"2021 MRE\") have been prepared by Resource Development Associates Inc. (\"RDA\"). Compared to the mineral resource estimates in the 2017 Report, the 2021 MRE included spatial modelling of the occurrence of antimony throughout the deposit as well as modelling of the locations of massive stibnite veins within the deposit. These details add valuable contributions to the reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction of gold for the Project. Gold mineralization has been interpolated into 10 x 10 x 10-meter blocks using inverse distance cubed (ID3) estimation techniques, believed to more conservatively support future production schedules as compared to the 2017 Report, which was based on Multiple Indicator Kriging of 15 x 15 x 10-meter blocks parceled into 7.5 x 7.5 x 10-meter selective mining units.\nTable 1 Mineral Resource Estimate \u2013 Open Pit Constrained \u2013 Economic Parameters at Gold Selling Price of US$1,650 per Troy Ounce. Resources Estimated at Variable Au Cutoff Grades \u2013 as described in Table 2\n(Qualified Person: Scott Wilson CPG; Effective August 20, 2021)\nClassification | Tonnes | Au (g/t) | Contained |\nMeasured | 646.0 | 0.60 | 12,482 |\nIndicated | 58.5 | 0.61 | 1,142 |\nTotal M & I | 704.5 | 0.60 | 13,624 |\nInferred | 16.0 | 0.40 | 207 |\nMineral resources for the Project were determined based upon a combination of 776 reverse circulation and diamond drillholes comprising 147,658 assays of which 125,450 assays measured detectable Au mineralization. High grade Au outliers were capped prior to compositing. Assays were composited to nominal ten-meter lengths, yielding 20,806 individual samples which were used for the estimation of mineralization. Mineralization was determined using inverse distance cubed estimation techniques, adhering to geological constraints throughout the mineral deposit.\nIn order to define the quantities of Au with \"reasonable prospects for economic extraction\" by open pit methods, RDA determined pit constraining limits using the Lerchs-Grossman\u00a9 economic algorithm which constructs lists of related blocks that should or should not be mined. The final list defines a surface pit shell that has the highest possible total value, while honoring the required surface mine slope and economic parameters. Mineral resources were determined at a gold selling price of US$1,650.\nThe parameters listed in Table 2 define a realistic basis to estimate the mineral resources for the Project and are based on the extensive scientific, metallurgical and engineering based analyses that have been completed by Tower Hill Mines since 2006. Mineral resources for the Project have been limited to mineralized material that occurs within the pit shells and which could be scheduled to be processed based on the defined cut-off grades. All other material within the constraining pit, which was not classified according to CIM Definition Standards, was characterized as non-mineralized material.\nTable 2 Pit Constraining Parameters\nParameter | Unit | Rock | Rock 5 | Rock 6 | Rock 7 | Rock 8 | Rock 9 |\nMining Cost | US$/tonne | 1.76 | 1.74 | 1.74 | 1.68 | 1.76 | 1.76 |\nProcessing | US$/ | 9.27 | 9.15 | 9.17 | 9.50 | 9.71 | 9.71 |\nG & A | US$/process | 1.55 | 1.55 | 1.55 | 1.55 | 1.55 | 1.55 |\nAu Recovery | Avg %1 | 84 | 80 | 71 | 67 | 55 | 56 |\nRoyalty | % | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 |\nAu Selling | US$/oz | 1,650 | 1,650 | 1,650 | 1,650 | 1,650 | 1,650 |\nAu Cut-Off | g/tonne | 0.21 | 0.20 | 0.25 | 0.25 | 0.33 | 0.33 |\nOverall Slope | Degrees | 45 | 45 | 45 | 45 | 45 | 45 |\n1 Average % Au Recovery includes massive stibnite at 22% recovery\nGrade and Tonnage Sensitivity to Cutoff Grade\nMineral resources at Livengood are sensitive to the selection of the reporting cutoff grade. To illustrate this sensitivity, the block model quantities and grade estimates within the constraining pit are presented in Table 3 at linear increases in the cutoff grades for measured, indicated and inferred mineral resources at Livengood. The same results are presented graphically in Figure 1. Mineralization is constrained to the pit using the parameters in Table 2. The numbers presented in Table 3 should not be misconstrued with a mineral resource statement.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, included herein, including statements with respect to the mine plan, economic analysis (including capital expenditures, operating expenditures, all-in-sustaining costs and all-in costs) and production and design details described in the PFS; the potential to convert mineral resources to mineral reserves; additional optimization and exploration efforts and the results thereof; the ability of the Company to satisfy the derivative liability and the consequences of any failure to do so; the ability of the Company to potentially include refined and updated results in a subsequent full feasibility study; the ability of the Company to advance environmental baseline work in support of future permitting; the ability of the Company to advance the Livengood Project either as projected or at all; the potential for the Company to make a construction decision, whether when warranted by market conditions or at all; the potential for market conditions to be such that they warrant the making of a production decision; the potential development of any mine at the Livengood Project; business and financing plans and business trends are forward-looking statements. Information concerning mineral reserve/resource estimates and the economic analysis thereof contained in the PFS also may be deemed to be forward-looking statements in that it reflects a prediction of the mineralization that would be encountered, and the results of mining it, if a mineral deposit were developed and mined. Although the Company believes that such statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as: believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, postulate, proposed, planned, potential and similar expressions, or are those, which, by their nature, refer to future events. The Company cautions investors that any forward-looking statements by the Company are not guarantees of future results or performance, and that actual results may differ materially from those in forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, variations in the nature, quality and quantity of any mineral deposits that may be located, variations in the market price of any mineral products the Company may produce or plan to produce, the inability of the Company to obtain any necessary permits, consents or authorizations required for its activities, the inability of the Company to produce minerals from its properties successfully or profitably, to continue its projected growth, to raise the necessary capital (including, as required, to satisfy the derivative liability) or to be fully able to implement its business strategies, and other risks and uncertainties disclosed in the Company's Annual Information Form filed with certain securities commissions in Canada and the Company's annual report on Form 10-K filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), and other information released by the Company and filed with the appropriate regulatory agencies. All of the Company's Canadian public disclosure filings may be accessed via www.sedar.com and its United States public disclosure filings may be accessed via www.sec.gov, and readers are urged to review these materials, including the 2017 Report and the technical report to be filed with respect to the Company's Livengood property within 45 days hereof.\nNon-IFRS Measures\nThe Company has included certain non-IFRS measures in this news release, as discussed below. The Company believes that these measures, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, provides investors with an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the Company. These non-IFRS measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. These measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS, and therefore may not be comparable to other issuers.\nAll-In Sustaining Costs (\"AISC\") and AISC/oz\nAISC is a performance measure that reflects the expenditures that are required to produce an ounce of gold from current operations. While there is no standardized meaning of the measure across the industry, the Company's definition is derived from the definition, as set out by the World Gold Council in its guidance dated June 27, 2013 and November 16, 2018, respectively. The World Gold Council is a non-regulatory, non-profit organization established in 1987 whose members include global senior mining companies. The Company believes that this measure is useful to external users in assessing operating performance and the ability to generate free cash flow from operations. The Company defines AISC as the sum of total cash costs, sustaining capital (capital required to maintain current operations at existing production levels), capital lease repayments, exploration expenditures designed to increase resource confidence at producing mines, amortization of asset retirement costs and rehabilitation accretion related to current operations. AISC excludes general corporate and administrative costs incurred at the non-project level, capital expenditures for significant improvements at existing operations deemed to be expansionary in nature, exploration and evaluation related to resource growth, rehabilitation accretion not related to current operations, financing costs, debt repayments, and taxes. Total AISC is divided by gold ounces sold to arrive at a per ounce figure.\nAll-In Costs (\"AIC\") and All-In-Costs/oz\nThe Company defines AIC as the sum of AISC costs plus initial capital expenditures. Total AIC is divided by gold ounces sold to arrive at a per ounce figure.\nCautionary Note Regarding References to Resources and Reserves\nNational Instrument 43101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\") is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators which establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects. Unless otherwise indicated, all resource and reserve estimates contained in or incorporated by reference in this news release have been prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 and the guidelines set out in the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the \"CIM\") Standards on Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council on May 10, 2014 (the \"CIM Standards\") as they may be amended from time to time by the CIM.\nAccordingly, information in this press release providing descriptions of the Company's mineral deposits in accordance with NI 43-101 may not be comparable to similar information made public by other U.S. companies subject to the United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nPursuant to CIM Definition Standards, \"Inferred mineral resources\" are that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality are estimated on the basis of limited geological evidence and sampling. Such geological evidence is sufficient to imply but not verify geological and grade or quality continuity. An inferred mineral resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to an indicated mineral resource and must not be converted to a mineral reserve. However, it is reasonably expected that the majority of inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to indicated mineral resources with continued exploration. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource is economically or legally mineable. Disclosure of \"contained ounces\" in a resource is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute \"reserves\" by SEC standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures.\nEffective February 25, 2019, the SEC adopted new mining disclosure rules under subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"SEC Modernization Rules\"), with compliance required for the first fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2021. The SEC Modernization Rules replace the historical property disclosure requirements included in SEC Industry Guide 7. As a result of the adoption of the SEC Modernization Rules, the SEC now recognizes estimates of \"Measured Mineral Resources\", \"Indicated Mineral Resources\" and \"Inferred Mineral Resources\". In addition, the SEC has amended its definitions of \"Proven Mineral Reserves\" and \"Probable Mineral Reserves\" to be substantially similar to corresponding definitions under the CIM Definition Standards. While the SEC Modernization Rules are purported to be \"substantially similar\" to the CIM Definition Standards, readers are cautioned that there are differences between the SEC Modernization Rules and the CIM Definitions Standards. Accordingly, there is no assurance any mineral reserves or mineral resources that the Company may report as \"proven mineral reserves\", \"probable mineral reserves\", \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources\" under NI 43-101 would be the same had the Company prepared the reserve or resource estimates under the standards adopted under the SEC Modernization Rules.\nThis news release is not, and is not to be construed in any way as, an offer to buy or sell securities in the United States.\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/international-tower-hill-mines-announces-pre-feasibility-study-results-on-13-6-million-ounce-gold-resource-301417058.html\nSOURCE International Tower Hill Mines Ltd.",

This is more than a 300% increase from the 83.7 oz of Dore from the first pour announced on July 13, 2021. Reaching another milestone event with the changes that we continue to make on the Bonanza Leach System, we improve production as the project moves forward.\nThe leaching commenced at the Bonanza Harquahala Mine on June 3, 2021, when pH levels increased to allow for safe sustained leaching. Approximately 35,000 tons of rock have been placed on the leach pad with the entire area under leach. Carbon has been placed in all four carbon columns and is collecting gold & silver from solution. As we continue to increase the production of gold, the Bonanza Mining Company will continue to stack and load the pad with an additional 465,000 tons of Crushed Rock.\nAlan Brown, TMBXF President & CEO, commented, \u201cWe are excited and expect the numbers to continue to increase. The personnel at the mine continue to seek ways to improve production and identify better options for leaching and ultimately create more enhanced leaching characteristics. The price of gold remains stable and strong at the price $1,780/oz.\u201d\nThe Bonanza Mine property includes the Harquahala and Golden Eagle mines, located approximately eight miles south of Salome, Arizona. The project totals 2,656 acres and has significant potential for gold and silver production in multiple phases moving forward. The Bonanza Mine is located where the Prolific Walker Lane & the Sonoran Geosyncline overlap, with likely extensions of Carlin Trend and Mesquite-style mineralization, generating Arizona\u2019s biggest, richest gold deposits.\nAbout Tombstone Exploration Corporation\nTombstone Exploration Corporation is a gold, silver and copper exploration & mining company based in Phoenix, Arizona. The Company\u2019s goal is to maximize shareholder value through focused exploration, testing and development of high-quality mineral targets in the prolific mineral producing areas in the Southwest United States.

(British Columbia), Southern Empire's VP Exploration and a Qualified Person (\"QP\") within the context of Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101; Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (NI 43-101).\nAbout Southern Empire Resources Corp.\nSouthern Empire is focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of metals and minerals deposits in North America.\nIn northeastern Durango State, M\u00e9xico, Southern Empire has an option to acquire a 100-per-cent beneficial interest in the 1,750-hectare Pedro Gold Project where 2014 drilling by a subsidiary of Newmont Mining Corporation encountered epithermal gold mineralization within basal conglomerates of the Ahuichila Formation. At Pedro, permits are established for up to 25 drill holes with nine drill holes currently planned; please see Southern Empire's news release of July 27, 2021.\nIn the Cargo Muchacho mountains of Imperial County, California, Southern Empire owns 100 per cent of the historical gold-producing American Girl mine property and holds options to acquire a 100-per-cent interest in the adjacent 2,160-hectare (5,338-acre) Oro Cruz property located approximately 22.5 kilometres (14 miles) southeast of the operating Mesquite gold mine of Equinox Gold Corp.\nAt Oro Cruz, extensive historical drilling and large-scale open-pit and underground mining of the American Girl, Padre y Madre, Queen and Cross oxide gold deposits by the American Girl Mining Joint Venture (AGMJV; ultimately owned 53 per cent by MK Gold Company and 47 per cent by Hecla Mining Company) occurred between 1987 and 1996. During that time, gold was recovered by either heap leaching of lower-grade, or milling of higher-grade ores until AGMJV operations ceased in late 1996 because of declining gold prices leaving the Oro Cruz property with many gold exploration targets in addition to the historical inferred resource estimate, reported In 2011 by Lincoln Mining Corp., totalling 341,800 ounces gold based on 4,386,000 tonnes averaging 2.2 grams gold per tonne at a cut-off grade of 0.68 g/t Au (4,835,000 tons at 0.07 ounce gold per ton; Please refer to the Cautionary Notice Regarding the Oro Cruz Property Historical Resource Estimate below).\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors of Southern Empire Resources Corp.,\nDale Wallster, CEO and Director\nCautionary Notice on Forward-Looking Information\nInformation provided in this news release may contain forward-looking information or forward-looking statements that are based on assumptions as of the date of this news release. Such information or statements reflect management's current estimates, beliefs, intentions and expectations and are not guarantees of future performance. Southern Empire cautions that all forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and that actual performance may be affected by a number of material factors, many of which are beyond its respective control. Such factors include, among other things: risks and uncertainties relating to Southern Empire limited operating history, the need to comply with environmental and governmental regulations, results of exploration programs on its projects and those risks and uncertainties identified in its annual and interim financial statements and management discussion and analysis. Accordingly, actual and future events, conditions and results may differ materially from the estimates, beliefs, intentions and expectations expressed or implied in the forward-looking information. Except as required under applicable securities legislation, Southern Empire undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise forward-looking information\nCautionary Notice Regarding Historical Resource Estimate\nThe historical resource estimate outlined above is disclosed in a technical report dated April 29, 2011, prepared for Lincoln Mining Corp. by Tetra Tech, Inc. and filed on Canadian Securities Administrators' System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (SEDAR). This historical resource is termed an inferred mineral resource, which is a category set out in NI 43-101. It was based on historical reverse circulation and core drill hole sample, underground channel sample, and blasthole sample assay results and calculated using ordinary kriging to estimate gold grades in 10-foot-by-10-foot-by-five-foot blocks. Accordingly, Southern Empire considers this historical resource estimate reliable and relevant as it represents key targets for future exploration work. However, a QP has not done sufficient work to verify or classify this historical estimate as a current mineral resource and Southern Empire is not treating this historical estimate as current mineral resources.\nWork Programs During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nTiming of Southern Empire's exploration programs will be contingent on governmental regulations regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and the availability of exploration-related personnel, drill contractors, equipment, lodging, et cetera. Southern Empire will adhere to COVID-19 directives regarding safe working practices putting worker, community and national safety first and will proceed with exploration and development work programs only if potential COVID-19 risks can be effectively managed.\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nSOURCE Southern Empire Resources Corp.\nView original content to download multimedia: http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/November2021/03/c9340.html",

AngloGold Ashanti has recently announced that the company\u2019s Obuasi mine may not resume production in 2021 after an incident in May. IAMGOLD has cut production guidance and increased cost estimates for Cote project.\nTraders should also keep an eye on the latest developments in Treasury markets as yields keep moving higher from recent lows which may put additional pressure on gold and gold mining stocks.\nThe near-term direction of gold mining stocks will depend on whether traders are ready to \u201ccatch the falling knife\u201d and buy gold mining stocks near multi-week lows.

(\u201cKirkland Lake Gold\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSX:KL) (NYSE:KL) (ASX:KLA) today announced results from 197 underground and 58 surface holes of drilling as an update of exploration drilling carried out at Fosterville Gold Mine since the December 31, 2020 Mineral Resources and Reserve update released in February 2021. The release includes diamond drilling results from five key areas across the Fosterville property, including underground targets at Lower Phoenix, the Cygnet Fault System, with associated hangingwall splay structures, and the Curie and Herschel Fault structures at Robbins Hill (Figure 1). Of the 197 underground diamond drill holes, 109 tested the Lower Phoenix structure, with the remaining 88 holes related to drilling of the Cygnet Fault System and associated hangingwall structures. At Robbin\u2019s Hill, 58 new surface diamond drill holes targeted the Curie and Herschel Fault structures. All drilling results and collar information are presented in Tables 1 and 2.\nTony Makuch, President and CEO of Kirkland Lake Gold, commented: \u201cThe results being released today continue to support our view that substantial potential exists to discover new high-grade mineralized areas and extensions and to grow Mineral Reserves at Fosterville. Following completion of the new P3912 underground drill drift, we commenced an extensive underground drilling program down-plunge of the Swan Zone in Lower Phoenix and have already returned a number of high-grade intersections containing the same quartz with VG mineralization that accounts for the ultra-high grades found in Swan. While the down-plunge extension of Swan Zone is obviously a key target for future growth in Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources, we are also very encouraged by continued favorable results at Cygnet, a parallel structure near the Swan Zone. The results at Cygnet include new high-grade, VG-bearing intersections as well as the identification of new splay structures and opportunities for further growth of the Cygnet Fault System to the north.\n\u201cTurning to Robbin\u2019s Hill, drill results continue to confirm the size and scale of the target areas at what we expect to become our second mining operation feeding the Fosterville Mill. Along the Curie Fault, we have now intersected VG mineralization up to 1,000 m down-plunge from current Mineral Reserves and at elevations from surface similar to where we first detected VG in the Lower Phoenix and Harrier systems. With the progress achieved advancing the new Robbin\u2019s Hill Decline, we have now commenced underground drilling at Robbin\u2019s Hill to support future exploration of the Curie, Herschel and other Fault targets. Underground drilling from the new Decline will significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Robbin\u2019s Hill exploration programs. We currently have nine underground and eight surface diamond drills operating at Fosterville, with a total of 210,000 metres of drilling expected to be completed during 2021.\u201d\nLower Phoenix Infill and Extension Program\nDuring 2021, underground diamond drilling targeting areas down-plunge of the Swan Mineral Reserves has returned encouraging results, demonstrating continuity of mineralization within, and extensions of Inferred Mineral Resources, in the Lower Phoenix System (Figure 2).\nDrilling was undertaken from several underground drill platforms, including the Harrier link drive, P4040 drive, and the new P3912 drive following its completion in early June. A total of 109 Lower Phoenix diamond holes (31,106 m) has progressively tested the Swan/Lower Phoenix over 550m down-plunge length from the Swan Mineral Reserve. Significant recent results include two that are at the southern extremities of the Lower Phoenix Inferred Mineral Resources approximately 500 m down-plunge of current Mineral Reserves. Drill testing down-plunge of these intercepts is planned to assess the continuity and extents of these VG occurrences.\nRecent significant intercepts from drilling in Lower Phoenix include:\n-\n51.7 g/t(1) over 2.6 m (ETW 2.2 m), Including 215 g/t1) over 0.6 m (ETW 0.5 m) in hole UDH4051\n-\n9.6 g/t(1) over 6.4 m (ETW 4.9 m), Including 78.8 g/t(1) over 0.5 m (ETW 0.4 m) in hole UDH4048\n-\n10.8 g/t(1) over 4.8 m (ETW 3.7 m), Including 31.2 g/t(1) over 1.1 m (ETW 0.8 m) in hole UDH3954\n-\n10.0 g/t over 17.6 m (ETW 10.4 m) in hole UDH3980\n(1) Visible-gold drill intercept\nNew drilling outside of the existing Indicated Mineral Resources reaffirmed the continuity of the largely sulfide-hosted mineralization with 30 intercepts greater than 15 gram-metre (gram-metre = gold grade x estimated true width), of which 11 are greater than 30 gram-metre, and two are greater than 100 gram-metre. One of the 100 gram-metre intercepts includes the presence of VG (UDH4051 as detailed above), while the other is a sulfide-gold hosted intercept (UDH3980).\nInfill and extension drilling of the Lower Phoenix area is continuing from the Phoenix 3912 Drill Drive.\nCygnet and Hangingwall Splay Program\nContinued infill and extension drilling of 88 underground diamond drill holes (15,545m) into the Cygnet Mineral Resource and adjacent area has identified several new hangingwall structures. With recent geological interpretation the broader structure has been resolved into several faults, now called Cygnet, Cygnet Hangingwall, Dove, Pen, and Ptarmigan Faults (Figure 3). Of significance, the Pen and Ptarmigan Faults have similar strike trends, approximately 325\u00b0 Mine Grid, as the northern parts of the Swan Fault, and have returned significant VG in quartz intercepts (Figure 4).\nOngoing drilling in the area and to the north will test for additional hangingwall splay faults.\nKey Intercepts include:\n-\nPen Fault Splay\n49.4 g/t(1) over 4.1 m (ETW 3.4 m), including 589 g/t(1) over 0.3 m (ETW 0.2 m) in hole UDH3851\n153 g/t(1) over 0.5 m (ETW 0.5 m) in hole UDH4065\n-\nPtarmigan Fault Splay\n258 g/t(1) over 1.8 m (ETW 1.4 m), including 4,460 g/t(1) over 0.1 m (ETW 0.1 m) in hole UDH4018\n142 g/t(1) over 2.0 m (ETW 1.5 m) including 1,590 g/t(1) over 0.2 m (ETW 0.1 m) in hole UDH3924\nInfill drilling of the Cygnet Mineral Resource and Reserve area has encountered eight holes with VG in quartz mineralization, of which four have the potential to expand the adjacent Mineral Reserves (Figure 5). The other three intercepts have the potential to increase the Mineral Resources.\nKey Cygnet intercepts include:\n-\n24.1 g/t(1) over 7.3 m (ETW 5.6 m), including 328 g/t(1) over 0.4 m (ETW 0.3 m) in hole UDH3751\n-\n18.7 g/t(1) over 2.6 m (ETW 2.5 m) in hole UDH3752\n-\n27.5 g/t(1) over 6.0 m (ETW 4.3 m), including 166 g/t(1) over 0.4 m (ETW 0.3 m) in hole UDH3753\nRobbin\u2019s Hill Drilling Programs\nSince late 2020, up to five surface diamond drills have operated in the Robbin\u2019s Hill area, primarily targeting gold mineralization along the west-dipping Curie Fault, one of the controlling structures for mineralization at Robbins\u2019s Hill. The program of extension drilling comprised 58 surface diamond drill holes (58,125 m) testing the Curie Fault and adjacent structures. The drilling, down-plunge of the current Curie Mineral Reserve, has continued to encounter strong mineralization and VG at elevations similar to those where VG was first noted in the Lower Phoenix and Harrier Gold Systems.\nVG drill intercepts were previously reported for the Curie structure at depths of approximately 500 m in the Company\u2019s news release dated December 10, 2019, with intercepts of 11.7 g/t(1) over 8.8 m (ETW 7.2 m) in hole RDH321, and 24.5 g/t(1) over 3.7 m (ETW 3.4 m) in hole RHD334A. The new drilling has intersected VG at greater depths, with occurrences recorded between 950 to 1,150 metres below surface on the Curie structure in four holes (RDH413, RDH439C, RDH441 and RDH441A) and are detailed below. These intercepts, as well as other sulfide-hosted gold results, increase the down-plunge extent of Curie mineralization to greater than 1,000 metres from current Mineral Reserves (Figure 6).\nKey Curie intercepts include:\n-\n23.1 g/t(1) over 2.2 m (ETW 1.4 m), including 103 g/t(1) over 0.4 m (ETW 0.2 m) in hole RHD413\n-\n81.3 g/t(1) over 2.6 m (ETW 2.5 m), including 982 g/t(1) over 0.2 m (ETW 0.2 m) in hole RHD439C\n-\n28.0 g/t(1) over 1.5 m (ETW 1.1 m), including 103 g/t(1) over 0.2 m (ETW 0.2 m) in hole RHD441\n-\n19.7 g/t(1) over 3.8 m (ETW 3.4 m), including 158 g/t(1) over 0.4 m (ETW 0.4 m) in hole RHD441A\n-\n6.8 g/t over 7.7 m (ETW 5.7 m) in hole RHD440A\n-\n9.0 g/t over 2.9 m (ETW 2.7 m) in hole RHD409A\n(1) Visible-gold drill intercept\nThree surface drills continue to operate at Robbin\u2019s Hill and are focused on the down-plunge extension of the Curie Mineral Resource, and testing of other targets. Two underground diamond drills, located at approximately 10,500mN, have commenced operating from the new Robbin\u2019s Hill Exploration Decline. These drills are also targeting down-plunge extensions of the Curie mineralization.\nThe Herschel Fault, located hangingwall to the Curie Fault, was drill tested as part of the drilling that targeted Curie Fault mineralization at depth. Drill intercepts for the Herschel structure are mostly less than 500 m below surface. Currently, the most significant intercept contains VG in quartz and is 160 g/t over 4.4 m (ETW 3.8 m), including 1,160 g/t Au over 0.6 m (ETW 0.5 m), in hole RHD412.\nAdditional drilling into the Herschel Fault will be undertaken once the Robbin\u2019s Hill Decline has progressed further to the north (approximately 12,000mN).\nRobbin\u2019s Hill Underground Decline Development\nUnderground development of the Robbin\u2019s Hill Exploration Decline commenced in January 2020 and has progressed well, advancing a total of 5,932 m as of July 30, 2021. The mid-2020 arrival of a smart jumbo has provided increased development capacity since commencement. The development, since the Q1-2021 has been used an underground drill platform for exploration diamond drilling activities as the ramp progressed northwards.\nQualified Persons\nTroy Fuller, MAIG, Director of Exploration, Australia, is a \"qualified person\" as such term is defined in National Instrument 43-101 and has reviewed and approved the technical information and data included in this press release.\nFor further information regarding the Company\u2019s 2020 Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources estimates for the Fosterville Gold Mine, please refer to the Company\u2019s News Release dated February 25, 2021 and the Technical Report entitled \u201cUpdated NI 43-101 Technical Report Fosterville Gold Mine In the State of Victoria, Australia\u201d effective December 31, 2018, both available on the Company\u2019s website and on SEDAR.\nDrilling and Underground Sampling Assay QAQC\nKirkland Lake Gold has in place quality-control systems to ensure best practice in drilling, sampling and analysis of drill core. All surface diamond drill hole collars are accurately surveyed using Leica TS16 Total Station Trimble R10 GPS and underground holes using a Leica TS16 Total Station (Table 2). Down-hole deviations are measured by either electronic gyro or single-shot instruments.\nSampling consisted of diamond drill core that was either half core or full core sampled. Half core samples were cut longitudinally in half with a diamond saw; one-half of the drill core was sent to an independent laboratory for analysis and the other drill core half retained for reference. Sample pulps are returned from the assay laboratory for reference and future geological or metallurgical studies. Drill core sample intervals vary between 0.1 and 1.3m in length and were determined from logging of sulfide and VG to geological boundaries.\nFor assay QAQC purposes Certified Reference Material (CRM) and Blank samples are inserted into the sample stream at rates of approximately 1 in 25.\nSamples containing visible-gold or considered likely to contain visible-gold were separated from sulfide gold samples and dispatched separately for assaying. At the laboratory \u201cvisible-gold\u201d jobs were processed through a single pulverizer and material barren of gold (\u2018quartz wash\u2019) was crushed before and after each sample to minimize the potential for gold to contaminate successive samples.\nAssays are either based on 25-gram fire assay or screen fire assay with Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) finish. Mean grades are calculated using a variable lower grade cut-off (generally 2 g/t Au) and maximum 2 m internal dilution. No upper gold grade cut-off is applied to the data. However, during future Mineral Resource studies the requirement for assay top cutting will be assessed.\nThe samples were assayed at On Site Laboratory Services, an independent laboratory in Bendigo, Victoria. The facility is registered under ISO 9001:2015 (CERT-40147) and operates in accordance with ISO/IEC17025 (accreditation no. 20456) under National Association of Testing Authorities, Australia (NATA).\nAbout Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd.\nKirkland Lake Gold Ltd. is a senior gold producer operating in Canada and Australia that is targeting 1,300,000 \u2013 1,400,000 ounces of production in 2021. The production profile of the Company is anchored by three high-quality operations, including the Macassa Mine and Detour Lake Mine, both located in Northern Ontario, and the Fosterville Mine located in the state of Victoria, Australia.

All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this release are forward-looking statements that involve various risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to planned exploration programs, costs and expenditures, the potential for the discovery of additional high-grade mineralized zones at the Fosterville Gold Mine, including statements made with respect to the future growth potential at Lower Phoenix, the Cygnet Fault and Robbin\u2019s Hill, changes in Mineral Resource estimates, potential growth in Mineral Resources, conversion of Mineral Resources to proven and probable Mineral Reserves, the ability to extend mine life and other information that is based on forecasts of future operational or financial results, estimates of amounts not yet determinable and assumptions of management. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to future exploration potential, project economics, timing and scope of future exploration, anticipated costs and expenditures, changes in mineral resources and conversion of mineral resources to proven and probable reserves, and other information that is based on forecasts of future operational or financial results, estimates of amounts not yet determinable and assumptions of management.\nAny statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions, expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance (often, but not always, using words or phrases such as \u201cexpects\u201d or \u201cdoes not expect\u201d, \u201cis expected\u201d, \u201canticipates\u201d or \u201cdoes not anticipate\u201d, \u201cplans\u201d, \u201cestimates\u201d or \u201cintends\u201d, or stating that certain actions, events or results \u201cmay\u201d, \u201ccould\u201d, \u201cwould\u201d, \u201cmight\u201d or \u201cwill\u201d be taken, occur or be achieved) are not statements of historical fact and may be \u201cforward-looking statements.\u201d Forward-looking statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ from those reflected in the forward-looking statements. Exploration results that include geophysics, sampling, and drill results on wide spacings may not be indicative of the occurrence of a mineral deposit. Such results do not provide assurance that further work will establish sufficient grade, continuity, metallurgical characteristics and economic potential to be classed as a category of mineral resource. A mineral resource that is classified as \u201cinferred\u201d or \u201cindicated\u201d has a great amount of uncertainty as to its existence and economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that any or part of an \u201cindicated mineral resource\u201d or \u201cinferred mineral resource\u201d will ever be upgraded to a higher category of resource. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into proven and probable reserves. Among the key factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking information are the following: the future impacts of COVID 19 and any government response to COVID 19, the ability of the Company to continue operations at its mine sites in lieu of the pandemic, its ability to reduce the spread of COVID 19 through the implementation of various COVID 19 screening and health and safety protocols at site, future planned exploration activities, risks relating to first nations and Aboriginal heritage, currency exchange rates (such as the Canadian dollar and the Australia dollar versus the United States dollar), risks associated with labour and employment matters, changes in the financial markets, future gold price, changes in applicable laws and compliance with extensive government regulation.\nThere can be no assurance that forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate and actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company\u2019s expectations include, among others, risks related to international operations, risks related to obtaining the permits required to carry out planned exploration or development work, the actual results of current exploration activities, conclusions of economic evaluations and changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined as well as future prices of gold, as well as those factors discussed in the section entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in the Company\u2019s Annual Information Form, financial statements and related MD&A for the periods ended December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2021 and other disclosures of \u201cRisk Factors\u201d by the Company and its predecessors, which are filed with the securities regulatory authorities in certain provinces in Canada and available on SEDAR. Although the Company has attempted to identify key factors that could cause actual results to differ materially, there may be other factors that cause unanticipated and unintended results. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.\nCautionary Note to U.S. Investors - Mineral Reserve and Resource Estimates\nThis press release has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the securities laws in effect in Canada, which differ in certain material respects from the disclosure requirements of United States securities laws.

Each Warrant is exercisable to purchase one common share of the Company at a price of $0.12 per share for a period of three years from the date of issue (the \"Expiry Date\"), provided that, if after four months from the date of issue, the closing price of the common shares of the Company on any stock exchange or quotation system on which the common shares are then listed or quoted is equal to or greater than $0.20 for a period of ten (10) consecutive trading days at any time prior to the Expiry Time, the Company will have the right to accelerate the Expiry Time of the Warrants by giving notice to the holders of the Warrants by news release or other form of notice permitted by the certificate representing the Warrants that the Warrants will expire at 4:30 p.m. (Vancouver time) on a date that is not less than ten (10) days from the date notice is given.\nIn connection with the Private Placement, the company may pay finders' fees in cash or securities, or a combination of both, as permitted by the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange (the \"Exchange\"). All securities issued pursuant to the Private Placement will be subject to a four-month hold period. The Private Placement is subject to approval by the Exchange.\nCorporate Update and Amendment to the Kinsley Option Agreement\nThe Company also announces that it is in discussions with Liberty Gold Corp. (LGD) (\"LibertyGold\") to amend certain payment terms under the purchase option agreement (the \"Kinsley Option Agreement\") dated November 29, 2019, as amended, between the Company and Liberty Gold, subject to the Company completing the Private Placement. The amendments would provide combined payments of US$1,250,000 in cash and US$1,250,000 in common shares of the Company on June 2, 2021, and June 2, 2022, respectively, instead of US$2,500,000 in cash on June 2, 2021 and US$2,500,000 in common shares of the Company on June 2, 2022, respectively. The first of these common share payments would be subject to a voluntary one year hold period from the date of issuance and upon their issuance to Liberty Gold and the completion of the Private Placement, Liberty Gold will hold in excess of 10% of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company and become its largest shareholder. Liberty Gold will have the right to terminate the Kinsley Option Agreement if it provides written notice of default to the Company of failure to make the required payments under the Kinsley Option Agreement and the Company fails to make the necessary payment within 45 days from the date of receipt of such notice. If the Company and Liberty Gold proceed with the foregoing amendments to the Kinsley Option Agreement, the Company may be required to obtain a waiver of the right of first refusal from Nevada Sunrise Gold Corporation. For further information, refer to the Company's filings on www.SEDAR.com including the annual information form for the year ended June 30, 2020, filed on May 26, 2021. Amendments to the Kinsley Option Agreement are subject to Exchange approval.\nKinsley Geophysics Program\nThe Company has engaged Las Vegas Nevada-based KLM Geoscience to begin an expanded, property-wide IP/resistivity geophysical survey program expected to commence on September 18, 2021 (Figure 1).\nGeophysical surveys completed during 2020 at the WFZ and Shale Saddle target areas correlate with drill confirmed high gold mineralization. Expanded geophysical surveys for 2021 will target the Secret Spot target and under-explored Kinsley North frontier area. At Kinsley North soil geochemical surveys reveal broad arsenic in soil anomalies coincident with structures and the prospective Pogonip-Notch Peak contact (the same host horizon as Long Canyon1) and Dunderberg shale rocks at depth cut by late northwest trending structures that are important gold mineralization hosts within the Kinsley resource area.\nSubject to the Company completing the Private Placement, exploration drilling will commence following completion of geophysical surveys to build on new discoveries and expansion of resources.\nHighlights of the 2020 Kinsley Drilling include1:\nWestern Flank - West side resource expansion drilling yields\n10.22 g/t gold over 6.1 metres within a broader zone grading\n2.63 g/t Au (sulphide) over 38.10 metres in KMR20-017\nWestern Flank - Central yields second highest-grade Dunderberg shale intercept\n15.1 g/t Au (sulphide) over 7.6 metres, including 24.1 g/t Au (sulphide) over 4.6 metres lower zone,\n9.08 g/t Au (sulphide) over 6.1 metres upper zone in KMR20-026\nMain Pit North Oxide Target yields high-grade intercepts 75 m outside current pit shell\n9.83 g/t gold over 7.6 metres high grade shallow oxide\nSecret Spot Target surface oxide New Discovery multiple intercepts including\n1.77 g/t gold over 25.3 metres in new surface oxide discovery in KMD20-007B\n3.81 g/t gold over 11.6 metres; including 11.3 g/t gold over 2.9 metres in KMD20-006\nAbout New Placer Dome Gold Corp.\nNew Placer Dome Gold Corp. is a gold exploration company focused on acquiring and advancing gold projects in Nevada. New Placer Dome's flagship Kinsley Mountain Gold Project located 90 km south of the Long Canyon Mine (currently in production under the Newmont/Barrick Joint Venture, Nevada Gold Mines), hosts Carlin-style gold mineralization, previous run of mine heap leach production, and NI 43-101 indicated resources containing 418,000 ounces of gold grading 2.63 g/t Au (4.95 million tonnes) and inferred resources containing 117,000 ounces of gold averaging 1.51 g/t Au (2.44 million tonnes)2. The Bolo Project, located 90 km northeast of Tonopah, Nevada, is another core asset, similarly hosting Carlin-style gold mineralization. New Placer Dome also owns 100% of the Troy Canyon Project, located 120 km south of Ely, Nevada.

However, since then, the investment backdrop has become more nuanced. Asset allocation in H2 might prove to be more difficult.\nFiscal Policy Factors In\nThe reflation narrative reflected the success of the COVID-19 vaccination rollout, paired with monetary and fiscal largesse. This combination led strategists to predict a V-shaped recovery as the global economy hit the reset button. Inflation prints came in higher than central bank targets, but 72% of investors in the June Bank of America Global Fund Manager survey believed the repeated reassurances of policymakers that this inflation was \u201ctransitory.\u201d\nIn both June and July, U.S. CPI recorded 5.4% increases. In the eurozone, PPI rose a record 10.2% year-over-year. Monetarists would argue we are now seeing the lagged effects of unprecedented stimulus. In April 2020 alone, U.S. M3 (aka broad money) rose by 7.3%, a figure higher than any full year over the previous decade. S&P reports that government spending has increased by the equivalent of 13% of global GDP.\nFiscal policy has become a significant driver of aggregate demand. President Biden\u2019s $1.4 trillion of infrastructure spending and the European Union\u2019s Green Deal at $1 trillion are two examples. These initiatives require labor. But just as inflation has been dismissed as transitory, the tightness in labor markets in the U.S. and the UK are regarded as short-term and frictional.\nThe Role Of Labor\nHowever, labor has an increasingly loud political voice. Supply chain bottlenecks in the wake of COVID-19 also suggest that the inexorable rise of offshoring and globalization will slow. The Phillips curve, which measures the relationship between prices, wages, and output fell into disuse in the 2000s. But labor compensation as a share of U.S. GDP has begun to tick up.\nHAS THE \u201cDEATH\u201d OF THE PHILLIPS CURVE BEEN GREATLY EXAGGERATED?\nSource: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\nIf policymakers are wrong and inflation proves sticky, gold is likely to move up the asset allocation agenda during the remainder of 2021. The opportunity cost of owning (zero-yielding) gold vs. 10-year U.S. Treasuries has only been lower in the last decade at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic between February 2020 and 2021.\nIn August 2020, the price of gold rose to new records, heading above $2000 per ounce. Globally, one-quarter of all bonds still have a negative yield (German bunds out to 30-years) and only one-third have a yield higher than 1%. India was eclipsed by Germany as the second biggest retail market for gold in H1, but Indian investors are returning as COVID-19 slowly abates. Current active cases there are at their lowest level since March 2020.\nThe latest Commitments of Traders report from the CFTC shows short gold (and silver) positions are being cut. Improving sentiment and changing positioning look likely to provide short-term support for gold.\nSupply And Demand At A Tipping Point\nBetween 2001 and 2011, the price of gold surged from $225 per ounce to $1906 per ounce. This was accompanied by a record M&A ($38 billion in 2011) and a capital expenditure binge. Since then, capex has fallen by 70%. Gold exploration budgets hit $10.8 billion in 2012, but gold discoveries (206 million oz.) peaked six years earlier. Since 2006, there have only a handful of new mines with potential reserves greater than 6 million oz. that have come on stream.\nCost-cutting has forced miners to focus on brownfield sites, and existing reserves are rapidly being depleted. The Witwatersrand Basin in South Africa has produced approximately 40% of all the gold ever mined, but current production is around one-tenth of its peak in the 1970s. Reserves at many of the world\u2019s biggest mines \u2013 Mponeng in South Africa, Carlin Trend in the U.S., and the Super Pit in Australia \u2013 are in decline.\nMark Bristow, the CEO of Barrick Gold, the second-biggest miner, said in August that \u201cthe gold mining industry\u2019s chronic tendency to harvest the gold price instead of investing in the future has resulted in declining reserves and a shortage of high-quality development projects.\u201d\nPerhaps the biggest support of all for gold is likely to come from central banks. At the turn of the century, the U.S. dollar made up 73% of reserves in the IMF\u2019s COFER database. That has fallen to less than 60%. The share of the Chinese renminbi and the euro have grown modestly, but the strong capital preservation characteristics of gold enable reserve managers to sell their dollars while waiting to see if a true competitor to the U.S. dollar will emerge from the challenging pack.\nThe Bank of Thailand purchased 90 tons of gold in April and May, increasing its holdings by 60%. The central banks of Brazil and Hungary have also been active, and Russia added to its gold holdings in July for the first time since June 2020. Almost 80% of reserve managers plan to increase their gold holdings over the next year, according to a survey by the World Gold Council.\nThis long-term support for gold prices from central bank buyers could provide a floor above $1700, given that new supply is highly constrained. If inflation remains stuck above policy targets, asset allocators will be forced to reconsider the traditional role of gold as a hedge. That would help gold regain its luster and could move prices higher.",

Investors can expect a similar performance this year as well if the yellow metal keeps on trading strong.\nB2Gold has returned almost 400% in the last five years, including dividends, notably beating the TSX Composite Index.\nImportantly, the stock is trading considerably cheap right now, which gives it a runway in case gold prices continue to rise.\nCanadian Natural Resources\nCanadian energy titan Canadian Natural Resources (TSX:CNQ)(NYSE:CNQ) is my second pick for an inflationary environment. In a broader context, higher inflation makes things more expensive. So, companies that can pass on their rising costs to consumers benefit from rising inflation.\nLikewise, low-cost energy producer Canadian Natural Resources could be a smart pick in these markets. It is an integrated energy producer with a diversified product portfolio.\nThe company has a strong balance sheet relative to peers and displayed disciplined cost management amid the pandemic. That\u2019s why CNQ continued to raise shareholder dividends last year as well when peer energy companies suspended their payouts. CNQ stock yields nearly 5% at the moment, way higher than the industry average.\nNotably, consistently rising dividend payments in inflationary periods provide unique stability to portfolios.\nAlimentation Couche-Tard\nConvenience store operator Alimentation Couche-Tard (TSX:ATD.A)(TSX:ATD.B) is my third pick for long-term investors. It operates more than 9,200 stores in North America under banners like Circle K, Couche-Tard, Ingo, Holiday, etc.",

The improved second quarter result compared to the previous year was mainly due to the following items:\nHigher prices for all metals with realized silver and zinc prices up approximately 50%.\nSilver and lead production nearly doubled at Lucky Friday.\nGreens Creek and Lucky Friday generated $42.8 million more gross profit.\nRamp-up costs decreased by $3.8 million due primarily to Lucky Friday's return to full production starting in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nLower interest expense by $1.6 million due to reduced debt, as no amounts were drawn on our revolving credit facility during the second quarter of 2021.\nIncome and mining tax benefits of $4.8 million compared to an income tax provision of $0.6 million.\nThese improvements were partially offset by:\nLower gross profit at Nevada Operations from a $9.4 million non-cash adjustment of stockpiled inventory to market value.\nHigher costs at Casa Berardi driven by costs associated with higher volumes and higher maintenance-related activities.\nLoss on metal derivatives contracts of $17.3 million ($13.3 million, non-cash and unrealized) compared to a loss of $14.0 million ($13.4 million, non-cash and unrealized) from increases in zinc and lead prices.\nExploration and pre-development expense increased by $8.7 million due to increased exploration at Midas, San Sebastian, Greens Creek and Casa Berardi, and for drift development to the Hatter Graben area in Nevada.\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by $4.1 million due to our higher share price increasing the value of accrued incentive compensation and the issuance of certain shares occurring a quarter earlier than in 2020.\nAn unrealized loss on investments in other mining companies of $0.8 million compared to a gain of $6.4 million.\nCash provided by operating activities was $86.3 million, $48.8 million higher than in the second quarter of 2020, due mainly to the $25.2 million increase in gross profit and the positive net impact of working capital changes.\nCapital expenditures totaled $31.9 million, with $24.3 million spent at the operations compared to $13.7 million in the second quarter of 2020, with the increase primarily due to higher planned expenditures at Casa Berardi of $12.2 million for the period. Expenditures at Lucky Friday and Greens Creek were approximately $6.0 million each. Capital expenditures also included $7.5 million related to royalty repurchases at the Nevada Operations and Casa Berardi during the second quarter of 2021.\nMetals Prices\nThe average realized silver price in the second quarter was $27.14 per ounce, 47% higher than the $18.44 in the second quarter of 2020. The average realized gold price increased 5% to $1,825 per ounce.

Alaska\nThe Greens Creek Mine produced 2.6 million ounces of silver and 12,859 ounces of gold with the mill operating at an average of 2,362 tons per day (tpd) marking another quarter of consistently strong performance. The decrease in silver production compared to the second quarter of 2020 was due to planned lower grades resulting from mine sequencing. Compared to 2020, cost of sales decreased by $2.2 million and the per ounce silver cash cost and AISC decreased by $7.83 and $6.43, respectively, due to higher by-products credits resulting from higher by-product prices, lower treatment costs from favorable changes in smelter terms and lower production costs, driven partially by lower COVID-19 related costs.5,6\nThe Company's estimated 2021 silver production of 9.5 - 10.2 million ounces is unchanged and gold production increased from 40 - 43 thousand ounces to 43 - 45 thousand ounces. The estimate for 2021 cost of sales has been updated to $222 million. Estimated cash cost and AISC, each per silver ounce has been updated to ($1.00)-$1.00 and $3.25-$4.00, respectively, with lower costs due to anticipated higher by-product credits.5,6\nCasa Berardi Mine - Quebec\nAt the Casa Berardi Mine, 31,333 ounces of gold were produced compared to 30,756 ounces in the second quarter of 2020 due to higher mill throughput which was partially offset by lower grades. The mill operated at an average of 4,117 tpd, which was 33% higher than the prior year period. The increase in cost of sales was due to higher throughput, mill contractor costs related to maintenance and optimization activities, and underground maintenance costs resulting from repairs and replacements of major components for the production fleet. The increase in cash cost and AISC per gold ounce for the second quarter of 2021 compared to 2020 was the result of the higher cost of sales, with the increase in AISC also resulting from higher sustaining capital spending.\nIn the 160 pit, 1.4 million tons of overburden were removed during the quarter. Ore from that pit is expected to start being mined and processed in Q4 2021, concurrent with the processing of the last of the East Mine Crown Pillar pit ore.\nThe Company's estimated 2021 gold production has been increased from 125 - 128 thousand ounces to 128 - 132 thousand ounces. The estimate for 2021 cost of sales has been updated to $220 million. Estimated cash cost and AISC, each per gold ounce has been updated from $900-$975 and $1,185-$1,275 to $1,000-$1,125 and $1,200-$1,325, respectively.5,6\nLucky Friday Mine - Idaho\nAt the Lucky Friday Mine, 0.9 million ounces of silver were produced in the quarter, an increase of 95% compared to the second quarter of 2020, with the mine at full production. The mill operated at an average of 906 tpd. We continue to test and optimize new mining methods to better manage seismicity and potentially increase productivity.\nThe cost of sales for the second quarter was $27.9 million, and the cash cost per silver ounce was $8.07. AISC was $14.10 per silver ounce.5,6\nThe Company's estimated 2021 silver production of 3.4 - 3.8 million ounces is unchanged. The estimate for 2021 cost of sales has been updated to $103 million. Estimated cash cost and AISC, each per silver ounce, has been updated to $7.60-$8.50 and $14.25-$16.25, respectively.5,6\nNevada Operations\nAt the Nevada operations, 14,947 ounces of gold and 45,125 ounces of silver were produced from processing previously stockpiled ore, including oxide material processed at the Midas mill and a bulk sample of refractory material processed at a third-party roaster facility. Total cost of sales for the second quarter was $18.0 million which included a $9.4 million write-down in the value of stockpile inventory to net realizable value due to lower than anticipated grades. Cash cost and AISC per gold ounce were $1,369 and $1,386, respectively, in the second quarter of 2021.5,6 The increase over the prior year period was due primarily to costs related to the ore stockpile inventory that was mined in previous periods and processed in the current period.\nWith processing of the oxide material complete, the Fire Creek Mine and Midas mill were placed on care and maintenance during the quarter. In the second half of 2021, approximately 10,000 tons of refractory material is expected to be processed as a test at a third-party autoclave facility. The ounces from this third-party processing are anticipated to be recognized as production at that time. Those ounces and any remaining finished goods inventory are expected to be sold in the second half of 2021. Pre-development for the Hatter Graben area at Hollister and exploration at Midas are ongoing.\nEXPLORATION\nExploration expenses were $8.4 million for the second quarter, an increase of $6.4 million compared to the second quarter of 2020 primarily due to increased activity and focus on the Green Racer Sinter discovery at Midas and increased activity at Greens Creek, Casa Berardi, San Sebastian, Heva-Hosco and Kinskuch. Exploration guidance was increased to $40 million earlier in the quarter. An update of the exploration program will be provided later in the third quarter.\nPRE-DEVELOPMENT\nPre-development spending was $2.9 million for the quarter, compared to $0.6 million for the second quarter of 2020. The increase over the prior year period is principally due to development of the decline to allow drilling of the Hatter Graben, which commenced late in the first quarter of 2021. Exploration drilling is expected in the third quarter. Pre-development guidance was increased to $8.5 million earlier in the quarter.\nDIVIDENDS\nCommon\nOn August 4, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.01125 per share of common stock, consisting of $0.00375 per share for the minimum dividend component and $0.0075 per share for the silver-linked dividend component.

In addition to operating mines in Alaska, Idaho, and Quebec, Canada, the Company owns a number of exploration and pre-development projects in world-class silver and gold mining districts throughout North America.\nNOTES\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nNon-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meaning prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n(1) Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure calculated as cash provided by operating activities less additions to properties, plants and equipment.\n(2) Adjusted net income (loss) applicable to common stockholders is a non-GAAP measurement, a reconciliation of which to net income (loss) applicable to common stockholders, the most comparable GAAP measure, can be found at the end of the release. Adjusted net income (loss) is a measure used by management to evaluate the Company's operating performance but should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss) as defined by GAAP. They exclude certain impacts which are of a nature which we believe are not reflective of our underlying performance. Management believes that adjusted net income (loss) per common share provides investors with the ability to better evaluate our underlying operating performance.\n(3) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measurement, a reconciliation of which to net income (loss), the most comparable GAAP measure, can be found at the end of the release. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure used by management to evaluate the Company's operating performance but should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss), or cash provided by operating activities as those terms are defined by GAAP, and does not necessarily indicate whether cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs. In addition, the Company may use it when formulating performance goals and targets under its incentive program.\n(4) Net debt to adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measurement, a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA and net debt to the closest GAAP measurements of net income (loss) and debt can be found at the end of the release. It is an important measure for management to measure relative indebtedness and the ability to service the debt relative to its peers. It is calculated as total debt outstanding less total cash on hand divided by adjusted EBITDA.\n(5) Cash cost, after by-product credits, per silver or gold ounce is a non-GAAP measurement, a reconciliation of which to cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization (sometimes referred to as \"cost of sales\" in this release), can be found at the end of the release. It is an important operating statistic that management utilizes to measure each mine's operating performance. It also allows the benchmarking of performance of each mine versus those of our competitors. As a primary silver mining company, management also uses cash cost, after by-product credits, per silver ounce on an aggregate basis - aggregating the Greens Creek, Lucky Friday and San Sebastian mines - to compare performance with that of other primary silver mining companies. Gold, lead and zinc produced have been treated as by-product credits in calculating silver costs per ounce. With regard to Casa Berardi and Nevada Operations, management uses cash cost, after by-product credits, per gold ounce to compare its performance with other gold mines with a by-product credit recognized for the value of their silver production. Similarly, the statistic is useful in identifying acquisition and investment opportunities as it provides a common tool for measuring the financial performance of other mines with varying geologic, metallurgical and operating characteristics. In addition, the Company may use it when formulating performance goals and targets under its incentive program.\n(6) All in sustaining cost (AISC), after by-product credits, is a non-GAAP measurement, a reconciliation of which to cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization, the closest GAAP measurement, can be found in the end of the release. AISC, after by-product credits, includes cost of sales and other direct production costs, expenses for reclamation and exploration at the mine sites, corporate exploration related to sustaining operations, and all site sustaining capital costs. AISC, after by-product credits, is calculated net of depreciation, depletion, and amortization and by-product credits.\nCurrent GAAP measures used in the mining industry, such as cost of goods sold, do not capture all the expenditures incurred to discover, develop and sustain silver and gold production. Management believes that AISC is a non-GAAP measure that provides additional information to management, investors and analysts to help in the understanding of the economics of our operations and performance compared to other producers and in the investor's visibility by better defining the total costs associated with production. Similarly, the statistic is useful in identifying acquisition and investment opportunities as it provides a common tool for measuring the financial performance of other mines with varying geologic, metallurgical and operating characteristics. In addition, the Company may use it when formulating performance goals and targets under its incentive program.\nOther\n(7) Calculations for 2021 include silver, gold, lead and zinc production from Greens Creek, San Sebastian, Casa Berardi and Nevada Operations converted using Au $1,525/oz, Ag $17/oz, Zn $1.00/lb, and Pb $0.85/lb.\nNumbers may be rounded.\nCautionary Statements to Investors on Forward-Looking Statements\nThis release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by such sections and other applicable laws, including Canadian securities laws. When a forward-looking statement expresses or implies an expectation or belief as to future events or results, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis. However, such statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from future results expressed, projected or implied by the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements often address our expected future business and financial performance and financial condition and often contain words such as \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"will,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"estimate,\" \"should,\" \"expect,\" \"believe,\" \"project,\" \"target,\" \"indicative,\" \"preliminary,\" \"potential\" and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements in this news release may include, without limitation: (i) new mining methods being tested at Lucky Friday to better manage seismicity and potentially increase productivity; (ii) Green Creek's estimated 2021 silver production, gold production, cost of sales, cash cost, and AISC; (iii) Casa Berardi's estimated 2021 gold production, cost of sales, cash cost, and AISC; (iv) Ore from the 160 pit at Casa Berardi is expected to start being mines and processed in Q4 2001, concurrent with the processing of the last of the East Mine Crown Pillar pit ore; (v) Lucky Friday's estimated 2021 silver production, cost of sales, cash cost and AISC; (vi) expectation of the Company to process 10,000 tons of refractory ore from the Nevada operations at a third-party facility in the second half of the year with production and remaining finished goods inventory to be sold at that time; and (vii) Company-wide estimates of future production, sales, costs of sales, cash cost, after by-product credits, AISC, after by-product credits, as well as estimated spending on capital, exploration and pre-development for 2021. The material factors or assumptions used to develop such forward-looking statements or forward-looking information include that the prices assumed in the calculation of cash cost and ASIC will occur and the Company\u2019s plans for development and production will proceed as expected and will not require revision as a result of risks or uncertainties, whether known, unknown or unanticipated, to which the Company\u2019s operations are subject.\nEstimates or expectations of future events or results are based upon certain assumptions, which may prove to be incorrect, which could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements. Such assumptions, include, but are not limited to: (i) there being no significant change to current geotechnical, metallurgical, hydrological and other physical conditions; (ii) permitting, development, operations and expansion of the Company\u2019s projects being consistent with current expectations and mine plans; (iii) political/regulatory developments in any jurisdiction in which the Company operates being consistent with its current expectations; (iv) the exchange rate for the USD/CAD and USD/MXN, being approximately consistent with current levels; (v) certain price assumptions for gold, silver, lead and zinc; (vi) prices for key supplies being approximately consistent with current levels; (vii) the accuracy of our current mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates; (viii) the Company\u2019s plans for development and production will proceed as expected and will not require revision as a result of risks or uncertainties, whether known, unknown or unanticipated; (ix) counterparties performing their obligations under hedging instruments and put option contracts; (x) sufficient workforce is available and trained to perform assigned tasks; (xi) weather patterns and rain/snowfall within normal seasonal ranges so as not to impact operations; (xii) relations with interested parties, including Native Americans, remain productive; (xiii) economic terms can be reached with third-party mill operators who have capacity to process our ore; (xiv) maintaining availability of water rights; (xv) factors do not arise that reduce available cash balances; and (xvi) there being no material increases in our current requirements to post or maintain reclamation and performance bonds or collateral related thereto.\nIn addition, material risks that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (i) gold, silver and other metals price volatility; (ii) operating risks; (iii) currency fluctuations; (iv) increased production costs and variances in ore grade or recovery rates from those assumed in mining plans; (v) community relations; (vi) conflict resolution and outcome of projects or oppositions; (vii) litigation, political, regulatory, labor and environmental risks; (viii) exploration risks and results, including that mineral resources are not mineral reserves, they do not have demonstrated economic viability and there is no certainty that they can be upgraded to mineral reserves through continued exploration; (ix) the failure of counterparties to perform their obligations under hedging instruments; (x) we take a material impairment charge on our Nevada operations; (xi) we are unable to remain in compliance with all terms of the credit agreement in order to maintain continued access to the revolver, and (xii) we are unable to refinance the maturing senior notes. For a more detailed discussion of such risks and other factors, see the Company\u2019s 2020 Form 10-K, filed on February 18, 2021, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as well as the Company\u2019s other SEC filings. The Company does not undertake any obligation to release publicly revisions to any \"forward-looking statement,\" including, without limitation, outlook, to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this news release or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as may be required under applicable securities laws. Investors should not assume that any lack of update to a previously issued \"forward-looking statement\" constitutes a reaffirmation of that statement. Continued reliance on \"forward-looking statements\" is at investors\u2019 own risk.\nHECLA MINING COMPANY | ||||||||||||||||||||\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations | ||||||||||||||||||||\n(dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts -

A reconciliation of cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization (GAAP) to cash cost, after by-product credits can be found in the cash cost per ounce reconciliation section of this news release. Gold, lead and zinc produced have been treated as by-product credits in calculating silver costs per ounce. The primary metal produced at Casa Berardi and Nevada Operations is gold, with a by-product credit for the value of silver production.\nNon-GAAP Measures |\n(Unaudited) |\nReconciliation of Cost of Sales (GAAP) to Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits and Cash Cost, After By-product Credits (non-GAAP) and All-In Sustaining Cost, Before By-product Credits and All-In Sustaining Cost, After By-product Credits (non-GAAP)\nThe tables below present reconciliations between the most comparable GAAP measure of cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization to the non-GAAP measures of Cash Cost, Before By-product Credits, Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, AISC, Before By-product Credits and AISC, After By-product Credits for our operations at the Greens Creek, Lucky Friday, San Sebastian, Casa Berardi and Nevada Operations units for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2021 and 2020.\nCash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Ounce are measures developed by precious metals companies (including the Silver Institute and the World Gold Council) in an effort to provide a uniform standard for comparison purposes. There can be no assurance, however, that these non-GAAP measures as we report them are the same as those reported by other mining companies.\nCash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce is an important operating statistic that we utilize to measure each mine's operating performance. AISC, After By-product Credits, per Ounce is an important operating statistic that we utilize as a measures of our mines' net cash flow after costs for exploration, pre-development, reclamation, and sustaining capital. Current GAAP measures used in the mining industry, such as cost of goods sold, do not capture all the expenditures incurred to discover, develop and sustain silver and gold production. Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Ounce also allow us to benchmark the performance of each of our mines versus those of our competitors. As a silver and gold mining company, we also use these statistics on an aggregate basis - aggregating the Greens Creek, Lucky Friday and San Sebastian mines - to compare our performance with that of other silver mining companies, and aggregating Casa Berardi and Nevada Operations for comparison to other gold mining companies. Similarly, these statistics are useful in identifying acquisition and investment opportunities as they provide a common tool for measuring the financial performance of other mines with varying geologic, metallurgical and operating characteristics.\nCash Cost, Before By-product Credits and AISC, Before By-product Credits include all direct and indirect operating cash costs related directly to the physical activities of producing metals, including mining, processing and other plant costs, third-party refining expense, on-site general and administrative costs, royalties and mining production taxes. AISC, Before By-product Credits for each mine also includes on-site exploration, reclamation, and sustaining capital costs. AISC, Before By-product Credits for our consolidated silver properties also includes corporate costs for general and administrative expense, reclamation, exploration, and pre-development. By-product credits include revenues earned from all metals other than the primary metal produced at each unit. As depicted in the tables below, by-product credits comprise an essential element of our silver unit cost structure, distinguishing our silver operations due to the polymetallic nature of their orebodies. Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Ounce provide management and investors an indication of operating cash flow, after consideration of the average price, received from production. We also use these measurements for the comparative monitoring of performance of our mining operations period-to-period from a cash flow perspective.\nThe Casa Berardi, Nevada Operations and combined gold properties information below reports Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Gold Ounce for the production of gold, its primary product, and by-product revenues earned from silver, which is a by-product at Casa Berardi and Nevada Operations. Only costs and ounces produced relating to units with the same primary product are combined to represent Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Ounce. Thus, the gold produced at our Casa Berardi and Nevada Operations units is not included as a by-product credit when calculating Cash Cost, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce and AISC, After By-product Credits, per Silver Ounce for the total of Greens Creek, Lucky Friday and San Sebastian, our combined silver properties. Similarly, the silver produced at our other three units is not included as a by-product credit when calculating the gold metrics for Casa Berardi and Nevada Operations.\nIn thousands (except per ounce

Published in the United States by Currency, an imprint of Random House, a division of Penguin Random House LLC, New York.\nSixty Elements in Your Pocket\nSmartphones provide ample fodder for those interested in waste in all its permutations. The newest and best models are launched at press events that rival Hollywood movie premieres; they cost a bundle, and people ooh and ahh over the latest, or fastest, or biggest, or smallest version\u2014depending on what\u2019s fashionable at any given moment. Wait a few years, though, and you can\u2019t even give them away. They sit in drawers gathering dust.\nWhat does the life cycle of a smartphone look like? How does it go from hero to zero\u2014and how much of the process of creating these ubiquitous devices is lost to waste?\nLike humans, smartphones begin and end as dust. To build one of these modern marvels, we start with the elements from the periodic table. In the case of your phone, it requires a lot of them. Sixty, in fact\u2014which is more than can be found in your body.\nElements are substances that cannot be broken down into any simpler substance. Gold and carbon are just gold and carbon\u2014unlike, say, bronze, which is a mixture of copper and tin. There are 118 elements, of which 83 are both stable and non-radioactive.\nSome of these elements are the so-called rare earth elements, which have become essential to our modern world. Despite the name, however, rare earth elements aren\u2019t actually rare. In fact, they\u2019re quite common. They\u2019re hard to obtain because their deposits aren\u2019t concentrated and they\u2019re difficult to mine and refine.\nThe most commonly used ones aren\u2019t all that expensive, despite how difficult it is to extract them. An ounce of lanthanum or cerium or samarium will set you back less than a quarter. Even the more expensive, heavy rare earth elements are still affordable\u2014certainly compared to an element like plutonium (which, if you could even figure out a way to buy it, would cost you more than $100,000 an ounce).\nIn addition, the worldwide market for rare earths is rather small. The value of all the rare earth elements mined in a year is barely as much as the value of all of the copper mined in two weeks or the aluminum mined in a month.\nSo why are they such a big deal? Because they do very specific things in electronics and, for the most part, they have no substitutes. Think of baking a cake. It may call for three cups of flour and a tablespoon of baking powder. If you are short a tablespoon of flour, no big deal, but if you leave out the tablespoon of baking powder, well, you don\u2019t have a cake. Baking powder isn\u2019t expensive and it isn\u2019t rare, but it\u2019s essential to baking.\nRare earths have amazing powers. They make things glow brighter. They magnetize objects. They can be mixed with metals to make vastly stronger alloys. The kinds of products they enhance are critical; many are essential for modern living.\nAnd our smartphones need most of them.\nHowever, the process of mining and refining rare earths isn\u2019t easy and takes a long time. It\u2019s a nearly alchemical process involving acids, ovens, and proprietary processes. Imagine trying to extract a tablespoon of pepper that has been randomly spread through a pound of salt. That\u2019s the basic purity we\u2019re talking about with rare earth ore. And some of the processes take up to two years to run.\nIn addition to rare earths, a smartphone requires a number of other elements. By weight, the most common is aluminum. By value, it\u2019s gold. The rest of the elements all come together in their own idiosyncratic way from every corner and crevice of the planet.\nOf course, they all have to be mined, a process that undergirds much of our modern world. Every person in a modern industrial economy like the United States, every single day of their lives, requires on average 20 pounds of sand, 15 pounds of coal, 3 gallons of petroleum, 1 pound of iron ore, 1 pound of salt, and 0.5 pounds of phosphate (which is used mostly in the fertilizers that grow the food we eat).\nAnd that\u2019s nowhere near everything. According to the Minerals Education Coalition, in all, 100 pounds of ore must be extracted from the earth every day of every year for your entire life to support your modern lifestyle. And that\u2019s just in the United States.\nYet in the grand scheme of things, mining doesn\u2019t use much land, and what it does use can often be reclaimed. That\u2019s the good news. The bad news is that the amount of resources consumed doing all that mining, from water to fuel, is enormous, as is the resource consumption associated with all of the processing that must be done.\nHow much waste is there in mining? In a sense, it\u2019s all waste. In a world without waste, ingots of refined elements would be conveniently strewn about the surface of the earth in great abundance, ready to be picked up and used. But, of course, they aren\u2019t.\nYou can see part of the effective waste factor in their prices. Take gold, for instance. What do you think it would cost to buy a gold mine with 1 million ounces of proven gold reserves? First-order thinking might suggest that the value of that mine would be the price of gold\u2014about $1,400 an ounce\u2014times the number of ounces in that mine, so\u2026$1.4 billion.\nBut in reality, because gold is so difficult to mine, you could buy the mine for a mere $50 million. That\u2019s right\u2014gold mines are generally valued at $50 per ounce of gold in them.\nIf gold sells for $1,400 an ounce, purified, and the gold mine is only valued at $50 an ounce, then it\u2019s easy to see that the $1,350 difference isn\u2019t the value of the gold but the waste inherent in extracting and refining it.\nBut even that $50 an ounce is waste. The mine is worth $50 an ounce only because significant amounts of labor and risk went into determining that it was in fact a proven source of gold. In a world without waste we never would have had to expend the capital and take that risk to make the assessment. Not every hole gold miners dig has \u201cpay dirt\u201d in it.\nThe value of all the gold in a random 100-acre tract of land is essentially\u2026zero. Gold is, in fact, worthless, in the sense that the minuscule flecks of gold that may or may not be in your backyard aren\u2019t worth anything. You can\u2019t go to the bank and borrow money against the gold mining rights of your backyard.\nIn addition to the waste implicit in the price of the elements, there is the human toll as well. Many mines are inherently hazardous to both people and the environment. Child labor and even forced labor are used around the world. Can the human cost be eliminated or at least mitigated? Can\u2019t those who manufacture goods like our smartphones do something about these issues? Yes, but it\u2019s not as simple as that, since the supply chains that bring these elements together touch untold millions of people.\nImagine a small village in the developing world. It may have a mine that has no miners as employees. Instead, anyone can come to the mine, chip out ore, bring it to the surface, and be paid for its weight. That ore is sold by the truckload to an intermediary that sells it by the trainload to a refinery in a distant city that buys from scores of producers. The chemicals needed to refine the ore are likewise made in distant facilities that have their own supply chains across a dozen countries.\nThe elements produced from the ore are made into components which are then shipped to another facility where a different step in the manufacturing process occurs. Those unfinished goods are aggregated at a different place in perhaps a different part of the world to have another step in the manufacturing process performed on them.\nIf you are in the business of building millions upon millions of smartphones, the number of people and places involved dwarfs the imagination. You simply cannot effectively police every step of the process to make sure best practices are always used.\nWhat you can do, however, is require those you do business with directly to follow certain guidelines, and require that they require their suppliers to do the same, all the way down the supply chain. Abuses are inevitable because there is almost always money to be made in the abuse business. But responsible manufacturers do surprise inspections of their suppliers, who are required to do likewise to theirs.\nCould a smartphone be made that uses only ethically sourced materials built in a sustainable way? As it happens, Bas van Abel set out to do just that when he founded Fairphone. The goal was to make a phone with a long-lasting design, completely modular so that it can be easily repaired and upgraded, built under good working conditions out of materials that were sourced from sustainable and safe environments. Oh, and the phone needed to be easily recyclable.\nClearly, the idea had merit. Fairphone began as a crowdsourcing project and sold twenty-five thousand units before production even started. To date, the company has sold well over a hundred thousand phones and is even \u201cmining\u201d resources from old, discarded phones.\nTo its credit, Fairphone isn\u2019t just taking the easy path to building a \u201cfair\u201d phone. The easy path would be to deal only with well-regulated developed nations\u2014by, for instance, purchasing materials from Australian mines instead of those in the Congo, where conditions are much murkier. Instead, Fairphone goes into the areas that are the most challenging and works with producers to improve conditions.\nBut even this practice is far from perfect. Van Abel admits, \u201cThe problem with that is you work with mines where there might be child labor. You work with mines where the working conditions are still not super-duper.\u201d He warns, however, that a more heavy-handed approach would end up backfiring. \u201cIf you go into a policing mode and tell them all what to do, they\u2019ll just show you what you want to see.\u201d\nEven with the best of intentions, which van Abel clearly has, it\u2019s difficult to fully execute his vision.\nThe waste\u2014both in materials and human costs\u2014is significant just to collect the materials of our smartphones. To go into the waste involved in manufacturing would occupy an entire book, so in the interest of brevity, let\u2019s assume the new phone gets made and is delivered into the hands of an eager consumer.\nNow let\u2019s jump forward in time a few years. That fancy new smartphone we meticulously built has reached the end of its useful life, at least as far as the person who bought it is concerned. What happens to the phone then?\nSurely, given the enormous cost, difficulty, and waste involved in mining all of the elements used in the phone, the valuable material in the device can be quickly and efficiently recycled, right?\nNot quite.\nWhy aren\u2019t smartphones recycled as much as, say, aluminum cans? At first glance, phones would seem to be ready-made for recycling; they are little containers of all kinds of conveniently ordered precious metals, all in one package. Throwing one out in the trash seems the epitome of waste, akin to a cartoon fat cat lighting a cigar with a hundred-dollar bill.\nBut this is where the challenge lies. You\u2019ve probably heard the statistic that the value of all of the chemicals in the human body is something like $1.92. On a theoretical level, that makes sense to most; after all, we\u2019re made of relatively common stuff\u2014carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, calcium, et cetera. Our smartphones, on the other hand, contain aluminum, gold, lithium, and all sorts of other materials.\nBut here\u2019s the bad news\u2014the raw materials in your cellphone are worth even less than the raw materials in your body. Only about half as much, actually.\nLet\u2019s look at the gold in a phone, which makes up half of the scrap value of the whole device. Worldwide, the average yield of primary gold production (that is, gold that originates in a mine) is 1 gram of gold per ton of ore. A gram is the weight of a paperclip. One ton of ore is about the size of a mini-fridge, the kind you might see in a college dorm room.\nThe kind of phone you think about recycling\u2014say, an iPhone 6\u2014weighs about 5 ounces. That means there are about 6,400 iPhones in a ton. According to metallurgist David Michaud of 911Metallurgy Corp., an iPhone 6 has 0.014 grams of gold in it. So our ton of iPhones contains about 90 grams of gold. So far, so good. The density of gold in an iPhone compares very favorably to what we might find in nature\u201490 grams of gold in a ton of iPhones versus 1 gram of gold in a ton of ore.\nIt\u2019s safe to say that if a gold prospector down in a mine were to come across a vein of pure iPhone, it would be cause for great celebration. Alas, the mother lode of iPhones is rarely found in nature.\nThe 3 ounces of gold you get from your ton of iPhones is worth $4,200 at $1,400 an ounce. This works out to about 65\u00a2 a phone.\nHere\u2019s the catch: The problem with recycling iPhones is not dissimilar to the problem with mining rare earths\u2014they\u2019re distributed widely. Since melting down your iPhone at home isn\u2019t a current option, we\u2019d have to figure out a way to get that device to a smelter for less than 65\u00a2. You could hardly mail one for that much, let alone figure out a way to buy the unwanted iPhones.\nBut there\u2019s still hope, since there are other substances of value in the phone, such as copper and nickel. To get the amount of metals found in a 5-ounce iPhone from primary production would require about 2 pounds of each respective ore. At current prices, the nickel in the phone is worth about 3\u00a2, and the copper 5\u00a2. The iPhone 6 contains about 31 grams of aluminum as well. This metal is worth about $1,500 a ton, which makes the aluminum in the iPhone worth about a nickel. Beyond gold, copper, and nickel, as the saying goes, the juice simply isn\u2019t worth the squeeze. Other metals in the phone are used in such minute quantities that it\u2019s more efficient to mine high-grade ore than to extract from the low-grade \u201core\u201d of the phone.\nSo\u202665\u00a2 for the gold, and 13\u00a2 for the other metals. It\u2019s difficult to make the numbers work.\nApple, however, is a bit more optimistic. In 2017, Apple launched a war against waste, hoping to one day be able to make its products from 100 percent recycled materials rather than using any primary production metals, and going so far as to launch a pilot program to build robots that can disassemble iPhones and other devices. Spoiler alert: They\u2019re not very close to achieving this goal.\nThe vast majority of discarded devices are still operational. So instead of shredding and melting down the phones or disassembling them with robots, what about reusing them?\nFunctional recycling happens to a certain point already. As previously noted, an early adopter who buys a $1,000 smartphone every two years generally doesn\u2019t toss it in the trash when deciding to buy a new phone. That phone is probably still worth at least $100, an amount most people don\u2019t cavalierly ignore. There are a number of ways that phone finds itself in the hands of a new owner.\nBut several years after it has been reused, passed along, and gone through a second or third lifecycle, the phone\u2019s value is down even more, perhaps to just $5 or $10. At this point, it isn\u2019t worth the trouble of selling the phone (transaction costs are a form of waste), but it still has enough value for someone to feel bad about chucking it in the trash.\nThus, it\u2019s likely to end up in the landfill known as the hall closet, or the ubiquitous junk drawer. Credible estimates suggest there are more than two billion cellphones stored unused in people\u2019s homes.\nAt the very end of its life cycle, no matter what happens, the phone is essentially worthless. What happens?\nMarc Leff, president and cofounder of GRC Wireless, might enter the picture. His company buys all cellphones, regardless of condition. You ship it and they send you a check. They pay different prices for each phone, from a dime for an old flip phone up to $400 for the latest and greatest phones made.\nWe caught up with Leff and chatted with him about the ins and outs of his business, which he seems to regard as both a livelihood and a mission. The phones that arrive in large numbers every day are divided into two roughly equal groups. The first group is phones that still work and can be sold in secondary markets. As Leff tells us, the goal is to get five or six life cycles out of a phone across its useful life, which is fifteen years. In fifteen years, the finest and best smartphones of today will likely be worth nothing to anyone in the world. And this half of his business is the lucrative part.\nThe other half of the phones, the ones that Marc pays as little as a dime for, are largely a money-losing or break-even proposition. They are subdivided into two groups. The first are disassembled for parts, usually in less-developed countries. These are the phones old enough to not have much value themselves but which are still widely used somewhere. There is no supply chain for parts for these older phones, so the folks who disassemble them are providing a useful service and making a living doing it, ultimately reducing the waste that would occur with a phone that is perfectly fine except for, say, a broken pin on the charging port.\nThe final group, the old phones that are barely worth a dime, are sent off to smelters to have the \u201ceasy\u201d metals, such as gold and aluminum, stripped from them.\nEventually, no matter how many life cycles you get from a phone, someday it will be worthless. And when that happens, unless there is major technological change that allows for recycling at home, phones won\u2019t get recycled, since it isn\u2019t even worth the postage to send them to someone (except perhaps a container-load at a time).\nIt\u2019s a paradox. On its own, one phone is essentially worthless. But in a given year, the world makes 1.5 billion smartphones and, sooner or later, those phones will have to be dealt with. In aggregate, now we are talking 22 tons of gold, and proportional amounts of all the rest of the raw materials. And this is just one single category of device, and a small one at that. Add in all the computer screens, TVs, laptops, and printers, and by one estimate, as far as gold is concerned, 10 percent of all new production could be replaced by recycling.\nHow do we keep this waste from occurring? The problem may seem intractable, but what if there\u2019s an easy answer?\nThere\u2019s an economics concept called \u201cinternalizing externalities.\u201d This practice charges the external costs of an action to the person or entity inflicting them. For instance, if Company X pollutes a river, then the damage done to the environment should be assigned a value, and whatever that value is should be levied in the form of tax on that company. Doing so forces the company to take into account the total impact of its actions, not just the ones it pays for directly. This method of taxation is also arguably the only form of assessment that can improve upon the theoretical efficiency of a free market.\nIf we can determine that a cellphone in a landfill inflicts $10 in damage to the environment, then we can enact a deposit system. When you buy a phone, you pay an extra $10 for it, up front. When the useful life of that phone is up, whoever owns it has two choices: They can toss it into the landfill, inflicting $10 in damage, or they can turn it in and get the $10 deposit back. Several states do this with beverage bottles: You pay a dime extra when you buy the drink, and someone gets a dime for returning the empty bottle. That\u2019s the same idea here.\nIf the societal cost of a cellphone in a landfill were zero, then the whole system would be reasonably waste-free. If a phone costs $1,000 today and fifteen years later it\u2019s worth a dime, 99.99 percent of the value of the phone was consumed. In a perfect world, if you could magically wave a wand and separate the phone into its core elements, they\u2019re only worth a dollar. Even if our $1,000 phone ends up being worth $1 and we throw it away, then we\u2019ve still gotten virtually all of the value out of the phone.\nBut the societal cost of a cellphone in a landfill isn\u2019t zero. So what is it? We don\u2019t actually know, but we do know that smartphones are made of some pretty toxic stuff. There\u2019s arsenic in many of them, as well as lead and mercury. Less well known, but just about as toxic, are cadmium, chlorine, bromine, and lithium. The trend, however, is to use less of these substances. Apple touts in its iPhone X Environmental Report that the device features \u201carsenic-free display glass\u201d and is mercury-free, PVC-free, beryllium-free, and free of brominated flame retardants.\nIn a sense, losing sleep over smartphones going into landfills misses a much larger problem. The combined weight of every phone manufactured last year is about 250,000 tons, but the amount of electronic waste the world produces each year is about 50 million tons. That means that if you took every phone made this year and dumped them straight into a landfill, the resulting increase in the world\u2019s electronic waste would be a rounding error.\nThat 50 million tons of electronic waste works out to about 15 pounds a person. However, if you live in the developed world, you threw out more than twice that. You have to throw out a lot of phones to equal the weight of that microwave oven that got trashed. Your phone may have a tiny bit of lead in it, but that big TV sitting in your garage has at least 6 pounds of it.\nIn the United States, electronic waste accounts for just 2 percent of landfill volume, but that 2 percent accounts for 70 percent of all of the toxic substances in landfills. With recycling rates of electronic waste hovering around 20 percent, this is a problem that will only get worse.\nWill we ever reach a point where it makes sense to mine landfills for the gold in them? Perhaps. The best assumption we can make suggests there are about 2 grams of gold per ton of landfill detritus\u2014twice what typical primary production might yield. But the landfill ore is far more toxic than gold ore, so it may not make sense.\nFor those of you with a well-developed sense of the macabre, perhaps you\u2019re wondering about the ore content of cemeteries. If you were to mine the top 6 feet of a cemetery, the yield would be about 0.25 gram of gold per ton of dirt, given reasonable assumptions about what percentage of people are buried with their jewelry, medical devices, or gold teeth. Luckily for the dead, that is pretty low-quality ore.",

The dollar rose, adding further pressure to prices.\nPhiladelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said Wednesday it\u2019s appropriate \u201cto slowly, carefully move back\u201d on bond purchases at a suitable time.

Meanwhile, the Fed Board plans to begin gradually selling a portfolio of corporate debt purchased through an emergency lending facility launched last year, as Covid-19 was spreading panic through financial markets.\nBullion has stabilized near $1,900 an ounce in recent days amid growing demand for the haven asset, aided by signs of accelerating consumer prices and the risk of an uneven economic recovery. Traders will be watching Friday\u2019s U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for May for further clues on the strength of the labor market and whether growth will spur inflation that could prompt governments and central banks to reduce stimulus.\nInvestors are shifting their focus to inflation from potential tapering risks, Suki Cooper, a precious metals analyst at Standard Chartered Bank, said in a Bloomberg TV interview on Thursday. The Fed\u2019s view of inflation as transitory has helped lift gold prices higher, she added. BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink also said the potential for a spike in inflation may be underestimated.\nSpot gold declined 1.2% to $1,885.96 an ounce by 1:45 p.m. in London.

In the second quarter of 2021, Fekola's mill throughput was a quarterly record of 2.29 million tonnes, 16% above budget and 47% higher than the second quarter of 2020. The Masbate Mine in the Philippines also continued its strong operational performance with second quarter of 2021 gold production of 56,878 ounces, well above budget by 8% (4,390 ounces), as processed grade (8% above budget) and recoveries (10% above budget) both exceeded budget which more than offset lower than budgeted throughput (8% below budget). The Otjikoto Mine in Namibia performed well during the second quarter of 2021, producing 26,891 ounces of gold, well above budget by 7% (1,786 ounces), mainly due to higher than budgeted processed grade (5% above budget) as the grade of ore sourced from the medium grade stockpile was slightly higher than anticipated during the second quarter. As expected, compared to the second quarter of 2020, total gold production was lower by 12% (29,981 ounces) due to planned significant waste stripping campaigns at both the Fekola and Otjikoto mines, which were largely completed in the first half of 2021 (for Phase 5 and Phase 6 of the Fekola Pit, and Phase 3 of the Wolfshag and Otjikoto pits). Gold production is expected to significantly increase in the second half of 2021, when mining at Fekola reaches the higher-grade zones of the Fekola Pit and mining at Otjikoto reaches the higher-grade zone at the base of the Wolfshag Pit.\nFor the second quarter of 2021, total cash operating costs (including estimated attributable results for Calibre) were $664 per ounce produced ($675 per ounce sold) and consolidated cash operating costs from the Company's three operating mines were $649 per ounce produced ($661 per ounce sold). Consolidated cash operating costs were approximately in-line with budget in the second quarter of 2021, as above budgeted gold production largely offset higher than budgeted realized fuel prices and processing costs. As expected, consolidated cash operating costs were higher in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $385 per ounce produced ($377 per ounce sold) in the second quarter of 2020, mainly due to the planned lower gold production and higher period stripping activities (described above). Total AISC (including estimated attributable results for Calibre) for the second quarter of 2021 were $1,016 per ounce sold (Q2 2020 - $712 per ounce sold) and consolidated AISC from the Company's three operating mines were $1,011 per ounce sold (Q2 2020 - $714 per ounce sold). Consolidated AISC were $32 per ounce sold (3%) below budget in the second quarter of 2021, reflecting higher than budgeted gold ounces sold, higher than budgeted gains on settled fuel derivatives and lower than budgeted sustaining capital expenditures partially offset by higher than budgeted royalties resulting from a higher average gold price realized than budgeted. The lower sustaining capital expenditures were mainly a result of timing of expenditures and are expected to be incurred later in 2021.\nFor the first half of 2021, total gold production was 432,256 ounces (including 29,233 ounces of attributable production from Calibre), well above budget by 7% (28,811 ounces), and 15% (74,199 ounces) lower than the first half of 2020 (for the same reasons outlined above). Consolidated gold production from the Company's three operating mines was 403,023 ounces in the first half of 2021.\nFor the first half of 2021, total cash operating costs (including estimated attributable results for Calibre) were $636 per ounce produced ($628 per ounce sold) (first half of 2020 - $390 per ounce produced and $394 per ounce sold) and consolidated cash operating costs from the Company's three operating mines were $615 per ounce produced ($606 per ounce sold) (first half of 2020 - $376 per ounce produced and $380 per ounce sold). Consolidated cash operating costs were $25 per ounce produced (4%) below budget in the first half of 2021, mainly attributable to higher than budgeted gold production. Total AISC (including estimated attributable results for Calibre) for the first half of 2021 were $974 per ounce sold (first half of 2020 - $717 per ounce sold) and consolidated AISC from the Company's three operating mines were $965 per ounce sold (first half of 2020 - $705 per ounce sold). Consolidated AISC were $95 per ounce sold (9%) below budget in the first half of 2021, reflecting higher than budgeted gold ounces sold, higher than budgeted gains on settled fuel derivatives and lower than budgeted sustaining capital expenditures partially offset by higher than budgeted royalties resulting from a higher average gold price realized than budgeted. The lower sustaining capital expenditures were mainly a result of timing of expenditures and are expected to be incurred later in 2021.\nFor full-year 2021, the Company remains on track to meet or exceed the upper end of its total gold production forecast range of between 970,000 - 1,030,000 ounces (including 50,000 - 60,000 attributable ounces projected from Calibre) with total consolidated cash operating costs forecast to be between $500 - $540 per ounce and total consolidated AISC forecast to be between $870 - $910 per ounce. The Company's 2021 production guidance does not currently include the potential upside to increase Fekola's gold production in 2021 from the nearby Cardinal inferred resource area, where production is now expected to commence in the third quarter of 2021 and the higher than budgeted processing capacity realized to date at the expanded Fekola mill.\nFor full-year 2021, as budgeted, the Company's consolidated gold production from its three operating mines is expected to be significantly weighted to the second half of 2021 due to the planned higher waste stripping campaigns at both the Fekola and Otjikoto mines which were largely completed in the first half of 2021. For the second half of 2021, consolidated gold production is expected to significantly increase over the first half of 2021 to between 555,000 \u2013 585,000 ounces when mining reaches the higher grade portion of Phase 5 of the Fekola Pit and Phase 3 of the Wolfshag Pit. Based mainly on the weighting of production and timing of stripping, consolidated cash operating costs are expected to significantly improve to between $380 - $420 per ounce and consolidated AISC to between $745 - $785 per ounce during the second half of 2021.\nSecond Quarter and First Half of 2021 Financial Results\nFor the second quarter of 2021, consolidated gold revenue was $363 million on sales of 200,071 ounces at an average price of $1,814 per ounce, compared to $442 million on sales of 257,100 ounces at an average price of $1,719 per ounce in the second quarter of 2020. The decrease in gold revenue of 18% ($79 million) was 22% attributable to the decrease in gold ounces sold (mainly due to the lower gold production and timing of gold shipments), partially offset by a 4% impact from the increase in the average realized gold price.\nAs expected, cash flow used by operating activities was $8 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to cash flow generated of $238 million in the second quarter of 2020. The decrease was in-line with budget and was mainly due to lower revenues of $80 million, higher production costs of $35 million and higher working capital outflows in the second quarter of 2021 for value-added and other tax receivables and current income and other taxes payables. Current income tax payments in the second quarter of 2021 included approximately $140 million related to 2020 outstanding tax liability obligations (comprised mainly of Fekola outstanding 2020 tax liabilities of $75 million and Fekola 2020 priority dividend obligations of $46 million). Based on current assumptions, including a gold price of $1,800 per ounce for 2021, the Company is forecasting to make total cash income tax payments in 2021 of approximately $380 million (including the $140 million related to 2020 outstanding tax liability obligations discussed above).\nNet income for the second quarter of 2021 was $74 million compared to $138 million for the second quarter of 2020. Net income attributable to the shareholders of the Company was $68 million ($0.07 per share) compared to $124 million ($0.12 per share) for the second quarter of 2020. Adjusted net income attributable to the shareholders of the Company (see \"Non-IFRS Measures\") was $52 million ($0.05 per share) compared to adjusted net income of $112 million ($0.11 per share) for the second quarter of 2020.\nFor the first half of 2021, consolidated gold revenue was $725 million on sales of 402,401 ounces at an average price of $1,802 per ounce compared to $822 million on sales of 496,600 ounces at an average price of $1,656 per ounce in the first half of 2020. The decrease in gold revenue of 12% ($97 million) was 19% attributable to the decrease in gold ounces sold (mainly due to the lower gold production and timing of gold shipments), partially offset by a 7% impact from the increase in the average realized gold price.\nCash flow provided by operating activities was $138 million in the first half of 2021 compared to $454 million in the first half of 2020. The decrease was mainly due to lower revenues of $97 million, higher production costs of $55 million and higher working capital outflows in the first half of 2021 for value-added and other tax receivables and current income and other taxes payables (including current income tax payments in the first half of 2021 of approximately $140 million relating to 2020 outstanding tax liability obligations).\nFor the first half of 2021, net income was $173 million compared to $221 million for the first half of 2020. Net income attributable to the shareholders of the Company was $160 million ($0.15 per share) compared to $197 million ($0.19 per share) for the first half of 2020. Adjusted net income attributable to the shareholders of the Company was $149 million ($0.14 per share) compared to adjusted net income of $207 million ($0.20 per share) for the first half of 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nB2Gold continues to maintain a strong financial position and liquidity. At June 30, 2021, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $382 million (December 31, 2020 - $480 million) and working capital of $558 million (December 31, 2020 - $465 million). In addition, the Company's $600 million Revolving Credit Facility remains fully undrawn and available.\nDue to the Company's strong net positive cash position, strong operating results and the current higher gold price environment, B2Gold's quarterly dividend rate is expected to be maintained at $0.04 per common share (or an annualized rate of $0.16 per common share), one of the highest dividend yields in the gold sector.\nIn 2021, the Company expects to generate cashflows from operating activities of approximately $630 million, based on current assumptions including an average gold price of $1,800 per ounce. Approximately $500 million of this total is expected to be generated in the second half of 2021, when the Company starts mining from the higher-grade areas of the Fekola Pit and mining at Otjikoto reaches the higher-grade zone at the base of the Wolfshag Pit.\nOperations\nMine-by-mine gold production in the second quarter and first half of 2021 (including the Company's estimated 33% share of Calibre's production) was as follows:\nMine | Q2 2021 | First-Half | First-Half | Second-Half | Full-year |\nFekola | 113,611 | 238,699 | 220,000 - | 310,000 - | 530,000 - |\nMasbate | 56,878 | 114,391 | 100,000 - | 100,000 - | 200,000 - |\nOtjikoto | 26,891 | 49,933 | 45,000 - | 145,000 - | 190,000 - |\nB2Gold | 197,380 | 403,023 | 365,000 - | 555,000 - | 920,000 - |\nEquity interest | 14,232 | 29,233 | 25,000 - | 25,000 - | 50,000 - |\nTotal | 211,612 | 432,256 | 390,000 - | 580,000 - | 970,000 - |\n(1) | \"B2Gold Consolidated\" - gold production is presented on a 100% basis, as B2Gold fully consolidates the results of its Fekola, Masbate and Otjikoto mines in its consolidated financial statements (even though it does not own 100% of these operations). |\n(2) | \"Equity interest in Calibre\" - represents the Company's approximate 33% indirect share of the operations of Calibre's El Limon and La Libertad mines.

In the second quarter of 2021, Fekola's mill throughput was a quarterly record of 2.29 million tonnes, 16% above budget and 47% higher than the second quarter of 2020. The higher than budgeted mill throughput was due to favourable ore fragmentation and hardness, as well as optimization of the grinding circuit, partially offset by mill feed grade which was 10% below budget in the second quarter of 2021, as Fekola's low-grade stockpiles were used to provide additional unbudgeted mill feed required as a result of the higher than budgeted processed tonnes. As expected, compared to the second quarter of 2020, gold production was lower by 23% (33,813 ounces) as a result of the higher waste stripping and lower mined ore grades in the second quarter of 2021, as Phases 5 and 6 of the Fekola Pit were developed during the first half of 2021.\nFor the second quarter of 2021, mill feed grade was 1.65 grams per tonne (\"g/t\") compared to budget of 1.84 g/t and 3.11 g/t in the second quarter of 2020; mill throughput was 2.29 million tonnes compared to budget of 1.98 million tonnes and 1.56 million tonnes in the second quarter of 2020; and gold recovery averaged 93.2% compared to budget of 94.0% and 94.8% in the second quarter of 2020. Mined ore tonnage and grade continue to reconcile well with the Fekola resource model, and ore production is expected to significantly increase in the second half of 2021 when mining reaches the higher-grade zones of the Fekola Pit.\nThe Fekola mill has the potential to sustain an annualized throughput rate which is higher than the original assumed mill expansion throughput rate of 7.5 million tonnes per annum (\"Mtpa\"). Mill processing trials conducted in the fourth quarter of 2020 demonstrated the potential to optimize the grind-throughput capacity of the expanded facility and increase hard-rock throughput and support the addition of saprolite ore tonnage in excess of the hard-rock capacity. Based on the positive results noted to date through to the second quarter of 2021, Fekola's annualized throughput rate is now expected to average 8.3 Mtpa for 2021 and average approximately 8.5 Mtpa (over the long-term), based on an ore blend including fresh rock and saprolite. For 2021 budgeting purposes, the Company assumed a throughput rate of 7.75 Mtpa.\nProduction planning for the nearby Cardinal inferred resource area, located within 500 metres of the current Fekola resource pit, is currently underway (the initial Inferred Mineral Resource estimate for Cardinal is 640,000 ounces of gold in 13.0 million tonnes of ore at 1.54 g/t gold). Grade control drilling at Cardinal was completed in the second quarter of 2021, and a 10,000-tonne bulk sample was mined and processed. Results indicate that the Cardinal material can be processed at Fekola. An Environmental and Social Impact Assessment has been completed and submitted to the Malian authorities. The Company is in the process of updating the Fekola Mine Plan to include production from Cardinal which is expected to commence in the third quarter of 2021.\nFor the second quarter of 2021, Fekola's cash operating costs were $617 per ounce produced ($606 per ounce sold), above budget by $73 per ounce produced (13%), due to higher than budgeted processing costs (related to the unbudgeted mill throughput of low-grade stockpile material) and fuel prices, and increased operational waste (due to lower than budgeted strip ratios). In addition, camp and medical costs were also higher than budget as the Company continues to manage COVID-19 related risks and maintain safe operations. As expected, Fekola's cash operating costs were higher in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $300 per ounce produced ($271 per ounce sold) in the second quarter of 2020, mainly due to the planned lower gold production and higher period stripping activities (as discussed above). Fekola's AISC for the second quarter of 2021 were $854 per ounce sold (Q2 2020 - $562 per ounce sold), in-line with budget, as higher than budgeted realized gains on fuel derivatives, lower than budgeted sustaining capital expenditures (mainly due to lower than budgeted pre-stripping costs) and higher than budgeted gold ounces sold offset higher than budgeted cash operating costs as discussed above.\nFor the first half of 2021, the Fekola Mine produced 238,699 ounces of gold, well above budget by 5% (11,699 ounces), and 23% (72,736 ounces) lower than the first half of 2020 (for the reasons outlined above).\nFor the first half of 2021, Fekola's cash operating costs were $557 per ounce produced ($541 per gold ounce sold), in-line with budget and higher than $274 per ounce produced ($278 per ounce sold) in the first half of 2020 (for the reasons outlined above). Fekola's AISC for the first half of 2021 were $811 per ounce sold (first half of 2020 - $542 per ounce sold), well below budget by $61 per ounce sold (7%), as a result of higher than budgeted gold ounces sold, higher than budgeted realized gains on fuel derivatives, lower than budgeted sustaining capital expenditures (mainly due to lower than budgeted pre-stripping costs and mobile equipment rebuilds) and lower than budgeted community relations costs, partially offset by higher than budgeted royalties. The lower than budgeted sustaining capital expenditures are mainly a result of timing of expenditures and are expected to be incurred later in 2021.\nCapital expenditures in the second quarter of 2021 totaled $9 million, primarily consisting of $2 million for the solar plant, $2 million for pre-stripping, $1 million for mine infrastructure and $1 million for the development of Cardinal. Capital expenditures in the first half of 2021 totaled $26 million, primarily consisting of $8 million for the solar plant, $7 million for pre-stripping, $4 million for mine infrastructure and $2 million for the development of Cardinal.\nFor full-year 2021, the Fekola Mine remains on track to meet or exceed the upper end of its forecast production range of between 530,000 - 560,000 ounces of gold at cash operating costs of between $405 - $445 per ounce and AISC of between $745 - $785 per ounce. Additional mining from the Cardinal inferred resource area and the higher than budgeted processing capacity experienced to date at the Fekola mill (as discussed above) have the potential to increase Fekola's budgeted 2021 and longer-term gold production. No adjustment to Fekola's 2021 guidance range has currently been made while the Company continues to evaluate the potential upside impact of these factors for the balance of 2021.\nAs a result of the planned higher waste stripping completed and lower mined ore grades realized in the first half of 2021 (as Phase 5 and 6 of the Fekola Pit were being developed), production is expected to be significantly weighted to the second half of 2021 (when mining reaches the higher grade portion of Phase 5 of the Fekola Pit). For the second half of 2021, Fekola's gold production is expected to increase significantly to between 310,000 \u2013 330,000 ounces and cash operating costs are expected to significantly improve to between $315 - $355 per ounce and AISC to between $670 - $710 per ounce (based mainly on the weighting of the planned production and timing of higher waste stripping).\nFekola Solar Plant\nFollowing the temporary suspension of the solar plant construction activities in April 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions, and a fire in the solar storage yard in January 2021, construction of the Fekola solar plant is now complete. A small crew will remain on site until mid-August 2021 to ensure that all final commissioning tasks and warranty issues are properly executed. With the solar plant now 100% online, it is expected to reduce Fekola's HFO consumption by over 13 million litres per year and lower carbon dioxide emissions by an estimated 39,000 tonnes per year. Solar production to date indicates that the plant will exceed initial power production estimates.\nMenankoto Permit and Bantako North Permit\nThe Company, through its Malian subsidiary Menankoto SARL (\"Menankoto\"), is currently involved in a dispute with the Malian Government related to renewal of the Menankoto exploration permit (the \"Menankoto Permit\") which forms part of the Anaconda Area and is located 20 km north of the Fekola Mine licence area. The Company strongly believes that Menankoto is entitled to a one-year renewal of the Menankoto Permit under applicable law. After ongoing discussions with the Malian Government were not ultimately successful in resolving the situation, on June 24, 2021 the Company announced that it had formally commenced arbitration proceedings against the Republic of Mali. The arbitration has been commenced pursuant to the arbitration clause set out in the Menankoto mining convention (the \"Convention\") governed by the 2012 Malian Mining Code (\"2012 Mining Code\"), on the basis that the Republic of Mali breached its obligations under the Convention and under the 2012 Mining Code. Based on the terms of the Convention, the arbitration will be conducted by the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes in Paris, France. In addition to pursuing arbitration under the Convention, the Company may pursue, as required, all other available legal remedies.\nNotwithstanding the commencement of arbitration proceedings, the Company is committed to continuing its ongoing discussions with the Malian Government to resolve the issue. Since the Company commenced its investment in Mali, B2Gold has always enjoyed a positive and mutually beneficial relationship with the Government of Mali. Most recently, B2Gold partnered with the Government of Mali to assist the people of Mali facing challenges created by the COVID- 19 pandemic, as well as its impact on the mining sector. B2Gold continues to explore additional ways in which it might help the Government and local communities deal with the impact of the pandemic.\nThe operations at the Fekola Mine, which is situated on a separate mining license 20 kilometres from the Menankoto Permit and projected to produce 530,000 to 560,000 ounces of gold in 2021, continue normally and have not been impacted by the dispute relating to the Menankoto Permit. In addition, the Fekola Mine has not included the Mineral Resources from the Anaconda area (comprised of the Menankoto Permit and the Bantako North permit) in the current Fekola life of mine plan. The Bantako North permit area (wholly owned and in good standing) contains a significant portion of the Mamba deposit saprolite material and remains open. Preliminary planning by the Company has demonstrated that a pit situated on the Bantako North permit area could provide saprolite material for at least 1.5 to 2 years to feed the Fekola mill commencing in 2022 subject to obtaining all necessary permits and completion of a final mine plan. This additional feed to the Fekola mill would benefit all stakeholders, including the State of Mali, B2Gold's 20% partner at the Fekola Mine.\nThe Company has conducted extensive exploration on the Menankoto deposit part of the Anaconda Area over the past seven years, with a considerable investment to date of approximately $27 million. The Company had planned a 2021 exploration budget for the Menankoto deposit of $8.3 million, out of a total Mali exploration budget of $26.4 million. B2Gold is one of the largest Canadian investors in Mali and the Fekola Mine is a flagship investment in the country's mining sector.\nMasbate Gold Mine - the Philippines\nThe Masbate Mine in the Philippines also continued its strong operational performance with second quarter of 2021 gold production of 56,878 ounces, well above budget by 8% (4,390 ounces), as processed grade (8% above budget) and recoveries (10% above budget) both exceeded budget which more than offset lower than budgeted throughput (8% below budget). Continuing the positive trend set in the first quarter of 2021, Masbate's mill recoveries continued to outperform the recovery model. To improve Masbate's gold recovery (and production) forecasts, a series of unbudgeted metallurgical test campaigns were performed in the second quarter of 2021, temporarily reducing Masbate's throughput for the quarter. Processed grade was above budget, as ore mined from both the Main Vein and Montana pits in the second quarter produced higher tonnage and grade compared to the reserve model. In addition, the metallurgical test campaigns completed also contributed to the higher than budgeted processed grade in the quarter (as one test campaign involved high grade ore from the Main Vein Pit which was originally budgeted to have been blended through the course of the full year). Gold production in the second quarter of 2021 was higher by 17% (8,224 ounces), compared to the second quarter of 2020, mainly due to higher mined ore grades, as a result of mining through higher-grade zones of the Main Vein and Montana pits in the second quarter of 2021.\nFor the second quarter of 2021, mill feed grade was 1.17 g/t compared to budget of 1.08 g/t and 0.94 g/t in the second quarter of 2020; mill throughput was 1.86 million tonnes compared to budget of 2.02 million tonnes and 1.99 million tonnes in the second quarter of 2020; and gold recovery averaged 81.5% compared to budget of 74.3% and 81.0% in the second quarter of 2020.\nFor the second quarter of 2021, Masbate's cash operating costs were $616 per ounce produced ($673 per ounce sold), well below budget by $83 per ounce produced (12%), mainly attributable to higher than budgeted gold production, and comparable with the second quarter of 2020. Masbate's AISC for the second quarter of 2021 were $899 per ounce sold, well below budget by $89 per ounce sold (9%), reflecting lower than budgeted cash operating costs, higher than budgeted gold ounces sold, higher than budgeted realized gains on fuel derivatives and lower than budgeted sustaining capital expenditures (mainly due to the timing of pre-stripping and mining-related capital expenditures). The lower than budgeted sustaining capital expenditures were mainly a result of timing of expenditures and are expected to be incurred later in 2021. Compared to the second quarter of 2020, Masbate's AISC were significantly lower by $161 per ounce sold (15%), mainly attributable to higher gold production.\nFor the first half of 2021, the Masbate Mine produced 114,391 ounces of gold, well above budget by 11% (11,242 ounces), and 22% (20,865 ounces) higher than the first half of 2020 (mainly due to higher mined ore grades and higher recoveries as outlined above).\nFor the first half of 2021, Masbate's cash operating costs were $612 per ounce produced ($627 per ounce sold), well below both budget by $82 per ounce produced (12%) and the first half of 2020 by $52 per ounce produced (8%). Masbate's AISC for the first half of 2021 were $860 per ounce sold, significantly below both budget by $140 per ounce sold (14%) and the first half of 2020 by $121 per ounce sold (12%).\nCapital expenditures in the second quarter of 2021 totaled $7 million, primarily consisting of $2 million for mobile equipment acquisition costs and rebuilds, $2 million for tailings storage facility projects and $1 million for pre-stripping. Capital expenditures in the first half of 2021 totaled $13 million, primarily consisting of $4 million for mobile equipment acquisition costs and rebuilds, $4 million for tailings storage facility projects and $2 million for pre-stripping.\nFor full-year 2021, the Masbate Mine remains on track to produce between 200,000 - 210,000 ounces of gold at cash operating costs of between $650 - $690 per ounce and AISC of between $955 - $995 per ounce. Masbate's gold production is scheduled to be relatively consistent throughout each of the remaining quarters of 2021.\nOtjikoto Gold Mine - Namibia\nThe Otjikoto Mine in Namibia performed well during the second quarter of 2021, producing 26,891 ounces of gold, well above budget by 7% (1,786 ounces), mainly due to higher than budgeted processed grade (5% above budget) as the grade of ore sourced from the medium grade stockpile was slightly higher than anticipated during the second quarter. As expected, compared to the second quarter of 2020, gold production was significantly lower by 38% (16,605 ounces), as processed ore was primarily sourced from existing stockpiles while significant waste stripping operations continue at both the Wolfshag and Otjikoto pits. Mined ore tonnage and grade continue to reconcile well with Otjikoto's resource model, and ore production is forecast to significantly increase in the second half of 2021 when mining reaches the higher-grade zone at the base of the Wolfshag Pit.\nFor the second quarter of 2021, mill feed grade was 0.99 g/t compared to budget of 0.94 g/t and 1.58 g/t in the second quarter of 2020; mill throughput was 0.86 million tonnes compared to budget of 0.85 million tonnes and 0.87 million tonnes in the second quarter of 2020; and gold recovery averaged 97.8% compared to budget of 97.6% and 98.6% in the second quarter of 2020.\nFor the second quarter of 2021, Otjikoto's cash operating costs were $854 per ounce produced ($885 per ounce sold), well below budget by $81 per ounce produced (9%), mainly attributable to higher than budgeted gold production and capitalized pre-stripping costs, offsetting higher than budgeted realized fuel prices and a stronger than budgeted Namibian dollar. As expected, Otjikoto's cash operating costs were higher in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $421 per ounce produced ($418 per ounce sold) in the second quarter of 2020, mainly as a result of the planned lower gold production (as discussed above). Otjikoto's AISC for the second quarter of 2021were $1,613 per ounce sold (Q2 2020 - $757 per ounce sold), above budget by $67 per ounce sold (4%), mainly due to higher than budgeted sustaining capital expenditures (due to higher than budgeted pre-stripping).\nFor the first half of 2021, the Otjikoto Mine produced 49,933 ounces of gold, well above budget by 9% (4,137 ounces), and 41% (35,312 ounces) lower than the first half of 2020 (for the reasons outlined above).\nFor the first half of 2021, Otjikoto's cash operating costs were $893 per ounce produced ($853 per gold ounce sold), well below budget by $69 per ounce produced (7%) and higher than the first half of 2020 of $431 per ounce produced ($417 per ounce sold) (for the reasons outlined above). Otjikoto's AISC for the first half of 2021 were $1,542 per ounce sold (first half of 2020 - $801 per ounce sold), well below budget by $82 per ounce sold (5%), as a result of the lower than budgeted cash operating costs and higher than budgeted gold ounces sold, partially offset by higher than budgeted sustaining capital costs (due to higher than budgeted pre-stripping and equipment rebuilds). The higher than budgeted pre-stripping costs of $5 million for the first half of 2021 are expected to be a permanent variance.\nCapital expenditures for the second quarter of 2021 totaled $21 million, primarily consisting of $12 million for pre-stripping in the Otjikoto Phase 3 and Wolfshag Phase 3 pits, $2 million for mobile equipment rebuilds and replacements, $5 million for Wolfshag underground development and $1 million for the national power grid connection line. Capital expenditures for the first half of 2021 totaled $40 million, primarily consisting of $23 million for pre-stripping in the Otjikoto Phase 3 and Wolfshag Phase 3 pits, $5 million for mobile equipment rebuilds and replacements, $10 million for Wolfshag underground development and $2 million for the national power grid connection line.\nDevelopment of the Wolfshag underground mine continues to progress on schedule. Development of the primary underground ramp commenced and continued through the first half of 2021 following the completion of the development of the portal in the fourth quarter of 2020, with stope ore production expected to commence in early 2022, in-line with original estimates. The initial underground Mineral Reserve estimate for the down-plunge extension of the Wolfshag orebody included 210,000 ounces of gold in 1.2 million tonnes of ore at 5.57 g/t gold.\nFor full-year 2021, the Otjikoto Mine remains on track to produce between 190,000 - 200,000 ounces of gold, as high-grade ore is scheduled to be sourced from Phase 3 of the Wolfshag Pit in the second half of 2021. Otjikoto's cash operating costs are forecast to be between $480 - $520 per ounce and AISC to be between $830 - $870 per ounce.\nApproximately 70% of the gold produced in 2021 is expected to be mined from Phase 3 of the Wolfshag Pit, with material ore production starting early in the third quarter of 2021 following the waste stripping campaign. As a result of the timing of this high-grade ore mining, Otjikoto's gold production is expected to increase significantly in the second half of 2021 to between 145,000 \u2013 150,000 ounces. Based mainly on the weighting of the planned production and timing of higher waste stripping, Otjikoto's cash operating costs are expected to significantly improve to between $330 - $370 per ounce and AISC to between $580 - $620 per ounce during the second half of 2021.\nOn average, Otjikoto's higher 2021 gold production level of between 190,000 \u2013 200,000 ounces is expected to continue through to 2024, with production from Wolfshag underground expected to commence in early 2022 to supplement ore from the Otjikoto Pit as well as existing medium and low-grade stockpiles for approximately three years based on current estimates.\n2021 Development\nGramalote Project (B2Gold \u2013 50%/AngloGold Ashanti Limited \u2013 50%) - Colombia\nThe Gramalote Project, owned 50% B2Gold/50% AngloGold Ashanti Limited (\"AngloGold\") is located in central Colombia, northeast of Medellin, in the Province of Antioquia.\nFollowing a review of Gramalote's feasibility study work to date, B2Gold believes that there is strong potential to improve the economics of the project (economic highlights were previously released on May 4, 2021 based on the feasibility study work to date), which could be developed by revisiting the original Gramalote Project design parameters included in the existing mining permit (as applied in the Gramalote Preliminary Economic Assessment in January 2020 and historical AngloGold studies) and further optimizing project design. Review of the updated Gramalote Ridge Mineral Resource also shows that further value can be created through additional drilling of the Inferred portions of the Mineral Resource area, both within and adjacent to the designed pit, with at least 25,000 metres of drilling planned and progressing in 2021 and a mineral resource update expected in early 2022. In addition, drilling is being carried out in the Trinidad deposit and drilling is planned in the Monjas West zone later in 2021.\nThe Gramalote Project team is advancing work on different project optimization opportunities to potentially reduce capital and operating costs, as well as improve operability and sustainability of the Project. Those activities include road optimization and layout, pit design and phasing, blast design optimization, river deviation changes, improved infrastructure layout, and further optimization of plant design. As noted, optimization efforts also include continuing exploration drilling at the Gramalote deposit with additional drilling and the Trinidad deposit and Monjas West zone, continuing to implement the Resettlement Action Plan, advancing the purchase of key properties required for project development, entering into a development agreement with a power company to commence studies to bring power to the Gramalote mill site, continuing the process of formalization and removal of artisanal miners to outside of the industrial area, and completing environmental and social studies necessary to support any potential permit modifications that are identified as part of the optimization process.\nAs the evaluation of the different optimization opportunities advances, B2Gold is reviewing what changes in the design could require minor and major permit amendments of the approved Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA). The supporting environmental and social studies continue to move forward as planned. B2Gold expects that any minor or major permit amendments required could potentially impact the development timeline and delivery of the final feasibility study for the Gramalote Project which is now expected in the second quarter of 2022. Completion of the feasibility study has been pushed out from the first quarter to the second quarter of 2022 as a result of an increase in planned drilling and the impact of ongoing COVID-19 restrictions. B2Gold and AngloGold recently agreed to a revised 2021 feasibility study budget (subject to final Joint Venture committee approval) of $69 million and are reviewing an additional budget of $17 million for the first quarter of 2022 to complete the final feasibility study and updated Mineral Resource estimate. The revised 2021 budget represents an increase of $17 million (Company's share $8.5 million) over the initial announced 2021 Gramalote Project budget of $52 million. If the final economics of the feasibility study are positive and B2Gold and AngloGold make the decision to develop Gramalote as an open-pit gold mine (decision date expected mid-2022), B2Gold would utilize its proven internal mine construction team to build the mine and mill facilities and operate the mine on behalf of the Gramalote Project.\nThe Gramalote Project continues advancing the resettlement programs, the coexistence and formalization programs for artisanal miners, the removal of miners to outside of the industrial area, continues to work with government and local communities on social programs, advances the purchase of key properties required for project development and is closing a development agreement with a power company to commence studies to bring power to the Gramalote mill site. The Gramalote Project continues to benefit from strong federal and local government support as well as continuing support from local communities.\nKiaka Development Project - Burkina Faso\nThe Company continues to review optimization opportunities for the Kiaka Project in Burkina Faso. Several areas which have the potential to reduce capital costs are being evaluated, including a simplified recovery process, alternative methods of tailing disposal, mine fleet alternatives, reduction in project infrastructure and the use of more local contractors. The Company anticipates that this work will be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2021. The Company remains committed to finding the best means of maximizing the value of the Kiaka Project for its shareholders. The 2021 budget for the Kiaka Project is $5.4 million.\nSummary and Outlook\nThe Company is pleased with its second quarter and first half of 2021 production results. Based on a strong first half of 2021 and above budget gold production, the Company remains on track to meet or exceed the upper end of its total gold production forecast range for 2021 of between 970,000 and 1,030,000 ounces (including 50,000 and 60,000 attributable ounces projected from Calibre) with total consolidated cash operating costs of between $500 and $540 per ounce and total consolidated all-in sustaining costs of between $870 and $910 per ounce.\nDue to the Company's strong net positive cash position, strong operating results and the current higher gold price environment, B2Gold's quarterly dividend rate is expected to be maintained at $0.04 per common share (or an annualized rate of $0.16 per common share), one of the highest dividend yields in the gold sector.\nThe Company also continues to advance its pipeline of development projects. Work continues on the Gramalote Project and based on a review of the feasibility study work to date, B2Gold believes that there is strong potential for a more robust project and has recently agreed a revised 2021 budget (subject to final Joint Venture committee approval) with its 50% joint venture partner, AngloGold, to advance the scope of planned feasibility study work. This includes revisiting the original Gramalote Project design parameters included in the existing mining permit, further optimizing project design and additional drilling of the inferred portion of the Gramalote Mineral Resource and further drilling of the Monjas West and Trinidad zones. Completion of the Gramalote feasibility study has been pushed out from the first quarter to the second quarter of 2022 as a result of an increase in planned drilling and the impact of ongoing COVID-19 restrictions. The Company continues to look at optimization opportunities for the Kiaka Project in Burkina Faso. The Company now expects that this work will be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2021. The Company remains committed to finding the best means of maximizing the value of the Kiaka Project for its shareholders.\nFollowing a very successful year for exploration in 2020, B2Gold is conducting an aggressive exploration campaign in 2021 with a budget of approximately $66 million (excluding the Gramalote Project). Exploration is focused predominantly in Mali, other operating mine sites in Namibia and the Philippines and grassroots exploration programs around the world. Many years of target generation and pursuing opportunities in prospective gold regions have culminated in the Company allocating a record $25 million in 2021 to high quality targets for its grassroots exploration programs, including several new regions.\nNotwithstanding the commencement of arbitration proceedings in Mali with respect to the renewal of the Menankoto Exploration Permit, the Company is committed to continuing its ongoing discussions with the Malian Government to resolve the issue. Since the Company commenced its investment in Mali, B2Gold has always enjoyed a positive and mutually beneficial relationship with the Government of Mali. Most recently, B2Gold partnered with the Government of Mali to assist the people of Mali facing challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as its impact on the mining sector. B2Gold continues to explore additional ways in which it might help the Government and local communities to deal with the impact of the pandemic. We believe that continued exploration success in Mali has the potential to deliver significant production upside in both the near term and over the longer term.\nThe operations at the Fekola Mine, which is situated on a separate mining license 20 kilometres from the Menankoto Permit and projected to produce 530,000 to 560,000 ounces of gold in 2021, continue normally and have not been impacted by the dispute relating to the Menankoto Permit. In addition, the Fekola Mine has not included the Mineral Resources from the Anaconda area (comprised of the Menankoto Permit and the Bantako North permit) in the current Fekola life of mine plan. The Bantako North permit area (wholly owned and in good standing) contains a significant portion of the Mamba deposit saprolite material and remains open). Preliminary planning by the Company has demonstrated that a pit situated on the Bantako North permit area could provide saprolite material for at least 1.5 to 2 years to feed the Fekola mill commencing in 2022 subject to obtaining all necessary permits and completion of a final mine plan. This additional feed to the Fekola mill would benefit all stakeholders, including the State of Mali, B2Gold's 20% partner at the Fekola Mine.\nThe Company's ongoing strategy is to continue to maximize profitable production from its mines, further advance its pipeline of development and exploration projects, evaluate acquisition opportunities and continue to return capital to our shareholders with a substantial dividend.\nSecond Quarter 2021 Financial Results - Conference Call Details\nB2Gold executives will host a conference call to discuss the results on Thursday, August 5, 2021, at 10:00 am PDT/1:00 pm EDT.
