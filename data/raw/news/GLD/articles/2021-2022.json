This release does not constitute an offer for sale of securities in the United States.\nQualified Person\nThe scientific and technical information contained in this news release has been prepared, reviewed and approved by David Tupper, P.Geo. (British Columbia), Southern Empire's VP Exploration and a Qualified Person (\"QP\") within the context of the Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101; Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (NI 43-101).\nAbout Southern Empire Resources Corp.\nSouthern Empire is focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of metals and minerals deposits in North America.\nIn northeastern Durango State, M\u00e9xico, Southern Empire has an option to acquire a 100-per-cent beneficial interest in the 1,750-hectare Pedro Gold Project where 2014 drilling by a subsidiary of Newmont Mining Corporation encountered epithermal gold mineralization within basal conglomerates of the Ahuichila Formation. At Pedro, permits are established for up to 25 drill holes with nine drill holes currently planned; please see Southern Empire's news release of July 27, 2021.\nIn the Cargo Muchacho mountains of Imperial County, California, Southern Empire owns 100 per cent of the historical gold-producing American Girl mine property and holds options to acquire a 100-per-cent interest in the adjacent 2,160-hectare (5,338-acre) Oro Cruz property located approximately 22.5 kilometres (14 miles) southeast of the operating Mesquite gold mine of Equinox Gold Corp.\nAt Oro Cruz, extensive historical drilling and large-scale open-pit and underground mining of the American Girl, Padre y Madre, Queen and Cross oxide gold deposits by the American Girl Mining Joint Venture (AGMJV; ultimately owned 53 per cent by MK Gold Company and 47 per cent by Hecla Mining Company) occurred between 1987 and 1996. During that time, gold was recovered by either heap leaching of lower-grade, or milling of higher-grade ores until AGMJV operations ceased in late 1996 because of declining gold prices leaving the Oro Cruz property with many gold exploration targets in addition to the historical inferred resource estimate, reported In 2011 by Lincoln Mining Corp., totalling 341,800 ounces gold based on 4,386,000 tonnes averaging 2.2 grams gold per tonne at a cut-off grade of 0.68 g/t Au (4,835,000 tons at 0.07 ounce gold per ton; Please refer to the Cautionary Notice Regarding the Oro Cruz Property Historical Resource Estimate below).\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors of Southern Empire Resources Corp.,\nDale Wallster, CEO and Director\nCautionary Notice on Forward-Looking Information\nInformation provided in this news release may contain forward-looking information or forward-looking statements that are based on assumptions as of the date of this news release. Such information or statements reflect management's current estimates, beliefs, intentions and expectations and are not guarantees of future performance. Southern Empire cautions that all forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and that actual performance may be affected by a number of material factors, many of which are beyond its respective control. Such factors include, among other things: risks and uncertainties relating to Southern Empire limited operating history, the need to comply with environmental and governmental regulations, results of exploration programs on its projects and those risks and uncertainties identified in its annual and interim financial statements and management discussion and analysis. Accordingly, actual and future events, conditions and results may differ materially from the estimates, beliefs, intentions and expectations expressed or implied in the forward-looking information. Except as required under applicable securities legislation, Southern Empire undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise forward-looking information\nCautionary Notice Regarding Historical Resource Estimate\nThe historical resource estimate outlined above is disclosed in a technical report dated April 29, 2011, prepared for Lincoln Mining Corp. by Tetra Tech, Inc. and filed on Canadian Securities Administrators' System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (SEDAR). It is termed an inferred mineral resource, which is a category set out in NI 43-101. It was based on historical reverse circulation and core drill hole sample, underground channel sample, and blasthole sample assay results and calculated using ordinary kriging to estimate gold grades in 10-foot-by-10-foot-by-five-foot blocks. Accordingly, Southern Empire considers this historical estimate reliable as well as relevant as it represents key targets for future exploration work. However, a QP has not done sufficient work to verify or classify the historical estimate as a current mineral resource and Southern Empire is not treating this historical estimate as current mineral resources.\nWork Programs During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nTiming of Southern Empire's exploration programs will be contingent on governmental regulations regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and the availability of exploration-related personnel, drill contractors, equipment, lodging, et cetera. Southern Empire will adhere to COVID-19 directives regarding safe working practices putting worker, community and national safety first and will proceed with exploration and development work programs only if potential COVID-19 risks can be effectively managed.\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nSOURCE Southern Empire Resources Corp.\nView original content to download multimedia: http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/December2021/02/c6556.html",

The Preview SW Property and portions of the Preview-North properties are located within the Mineral Exploration Zone of Lac La Ronge Provincial Park.\nThe addition of the Preview SW Property is synergistic with MAS Gold's deposits, significantly expanding MAS Gold's mineral asset base in the La Ronge Gold Belt.\nThe Preview SW Property's gold deposit hosts historical resources, at a 0.50 gram/tonne gold (g/t Au) cut-off grade (Technical Report, Simpson 2016 1):\nAn historical Indicated Mineral Resource containing 158,300 ounces of gold (2.61 million tonnes grading 1.89 g/t Au); and\nAn historical Inferred Mineral Resource containing 270,800 ounces of gold (5.70 million tonnes grading 1.48 g/t Au).\nUpon the closing of the Proposed Transaction Comstock will have the right to appoint one director for a minimum of two years. Comstock will also provide additional funding in the amount of $200,000, to be spent in Q1 2022 in conjunction with input from MAS Gold, exploring its Preview SW Property prior to closing of the Proposed Transaction. A definitive agreement will be signed prior to January 15th,2022 and closing is anticipated in March, 2022 after both companies' AGM and shareholder vote anticipated to take place in late February, 2022.\nJim Engdahl, MAS Gold's President and CEO remarked, \"We are very excited with the friendly acquisition of the Preview SW Property's gold deposit located within 10 kilometres of MAS Gold's North Lake gold deposit, the recently acquired former Contact Lake gold mine and Point gold deposit. Upon completion of the Proposed Transaction this high-quality asset combined with MAS Gold's mineral portfolio, which includes the recently updated North Lake and Greywacke North mineral resources announced December 6, 2021 and December 9, 2021, respectively, MAS Gold will become one of Saskatchewan's biggest gold developers.\"\nJim added, \"Under the terms of the Proposed Transaction Steven Goldman, the President and CEO of Comstock will join the MAS Gold. We look forward to working with him.\"\nMr. Goldman, President commented, \"On behalf of Comstock, I believe the Proposed Transaction will be highly advantageous and synergistic for both Comstock's and MAS Gold's shareholders. We are delighted to have the opportunity to pass Comstock's Preview SW gold project to MAS Gold where we believe the combination of gold resources, MAS Gold's experienced management team, and technical mining talent, will quickly accelerate the creation of a significant gold deposit in the La Ronge Gold Belt. Ultimately we believe that the Proposed Transaction will help create significant shareholder value in the years to come for both Comstock's and MAS Gold's shareholders.\"\nFor the purposes of this News Release and MAS Gold, the 2016 Simpson Technical Report is treated as historical. A Qualified Person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as a current mineral resource and MAS gold is not treating this historical estimate as current mineral resources.\nMAS Gold and Comstock consider the Preview SW historical mineral resource estimate to be relevant and reliable. The Preview SW estimate was constrained by 3D wireframes representing zones of high shear intensity and grade continuity. The drill database comprised 162 core holes totaling 26,250 m drilled between 1985 and 2013. Drill hole data was composited on 1 metre intervals and composites were capped at 50 g/t Au. Final gold grades were estimated using the inverse distance method to the 3rd power (ID3). Bulk density values were assigned to blocks according to lithology based on specific gravity field measurements. A block model was created in Gemcom-Surpac Vision\u00a9 software using a block size 5 x 5 x 5 metres. Mineral resources amenable to open pit mining methods were constrained using a Lerchs-Grossmann optimized pit. Assumptions include US$1,300/oz Au, 90% Au recovery, US$2.50/tonne mining cost, US$15.50/tonne process, and G&A cost. No allowances have been made for mining losses and dilution. Pit slope angle of 45\u00b0.\nThe Preview SW estimate was classified using the definitions set out in CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (2010), which was superseded by CIM (2014). Similarly, the Preview SW estimate predates CIM Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines (2019). To verify the historical estimate as a current mineral resource a Qualified Person would need to prepare an updated mineral resource estimate and NI 43-101 technical report with respect to the Preview SW Property that incorporates additional drilling completed since the since 2013, which includes 24 holes totaling 4,700 metres targeting the Preview North zone and Preview SW during 2017 and 2018 (7 holes totalling 1,850 m at the Preview SW).\nQualifying Statements and Mineral Resources\nThe contained gold ounces are in situ. No assurance can be given that the estimated quantities will be produced. All figures have been rounded to reflect accuracy and to comply with securities regulatory requirements. Summations within the tables may not agree due to rounding.\nMineral Resources, which are not Mineral Reserves, do not have demonstrated economic viability. The estimate of Mineral Resources may be materially affected by gold price, environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political, marketing or other relevant issues.\nThe following Technical Reports are available on SEDAR:\n1. | 43-101 Technical Report, Preview SW Gold Project, La Ronge, Saskatchewan, prepared for Comstock Metals Ltd. by Ronald G.

In the belt, MAS Gold operates four properties including the Preview-North, Greywacke Lake, Elizabeth Lake and Henry Lake Properties that extend along segments totaling roughly 60 kilometres of the geologically prospective La Ronge, Kisseynew and Glennie Domains that make up the La Ronge Gold Belt (see Figure 1).\nMAS Gold's holdings include the North Lake, Greywacke North, Bakos (Contact Lake) and Point gold deposits and the historically defined Elizabeth Lake copper-gold volcanic-hosted massive sulphide deposit within four properties totalling 34,703.4 hectares (85,753.8 acres).\nThe North Lake deposit located at the Preview-North Property is estimated to contain an Inferred Mineral Resource of 18,100,000 t grading 0.85 g/t Au, hence 494,000 contained ounces of gold. The Technical Report about the updated Mineral Resource estimate will be filed in January, 2022 (see MAS Gold news release dated December 9, 2021).\nThe Greywacke North deposit, which hosts multiple known stratabound, high-grade gold-bearing zones, has an updated, combined openpit and underground Indicated Mineral Resource of 645,000 t averaging 4.90 g/t Au for 101,000 insitu ounces of gold (600,000 t at 4.89 g/t Au, and 45,000t at 5.03 g/t Au, respectively), plus a combined openpit and underground Inferred Mineral Resource of 410,000 t averaging 4.12 g/t Au for 55,000 insitu ounces of gold (35,000 t at 1.97 g/t Au, and 375,000 t at 4.33 g/t Au, respectively). The Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources were estimated using openpit and underground cut-off grades of 0.65 g/t Au and 1.75 g/t Au, respectively. The Technical Report about the updated Mineral Resource estimate will be filed in January, 2022 (see MAS Gold news release dated December 6, 2021).\nThe Bakos deposit, located on the former Contact Lake Mine holding, was first identified by Saskatchewan Mining Development Corporation (SMDC; later Cameco Corporation) exploration field crews in 1984. Operations were conducted from December 1994 until closure in December 1998. Historical production and recovery values for the entire operation included 188,185 ounces gold produced from 1,006,673 tonnes processed with a head grade of 6.16 g/t Au at a recovery rate o 95% (Leniuk, G., B.

Any cash payments on Josemaria Resources Shares traded on Nasdaq Stockholm will be paid in Swedish kronor in accordance with Euroclear Sweden principles.\nLundin Mining and Josemaria Resources will host a joint conference call and webcast at 8:00 am ET, 14:00 CET on Monday, December 20, 2021 to discuss the Transaction. Call details are outlined at the end of this news release.\nAcquisition Highlights and Strategic Rationale\nAligned with Lundin Mining's Strategic Goals \u2013 Acquisition of the world-class Josemaria project delivers large-scale copper-gold growth. Delivering on the Company's stated strategy, Josemaria complements the existing portfolio of high-quality, long-life base metals mines and adds a strong third pillar to its South American copper business.\nMaterially Increases Lundin Mining Copper Production and Scale \u2013 Once in production, Josemaria is expected to produce on average over 130,000 tonnes of copper, nearly 225,000 oz of gold and 1.0 million oz of silver annually over a 19-year mine life1. This growth would increase the Company's copper production by nearly 50%, and gold production over 140%, compared to guidance for 2022. Josemaria is a top-10 open pit copper asset in the Americas with an estimated 6.7 billion lb of copper, 7.0 million oz of gold and 30.7 million oz of silver in Mineral Reserves2.\nClear Path to Development \u2013 Josemaria Resources has been advancing the feasibility-stage project through environmental approvals with the Province of San Juan and has been negotiating commercial and fiscal terms with the San Juan and Federal authorities. Josemaria Resources anticipates these will be finalized in 2022 and has outlined a project timeline of approximately five years to commercial production. The Lundin family has a 30-year track record of successfully developing mutually beneficial relationships in San Juan and Catamarca provinces of Argentina.\nRobust Project Economics \u2013 The November 2020 Josemaria Technical Report estimates robust after-tax NPV, IRR and a short payback period using conservative-to-spot metal prices. With cash costs forecast to be in the 2nd quartile globally, Josemaria is positioned to generate meaningful cash flow throughout the metal price cycle.\nRemoves Project Financing Constraints \u2013 Within Lundin Mining, capital financing risks to the project timeline and Josemaria Resources shareholders are significantly reduced. The project capital and development timeline offer many funding options under Lundin Mining's stewardship making advancement of permitting and construction the primary focus. The Company expects to continue to generate significant free cash flow at current metal prices, has significant debt capacity supported by the existing portfolio of assets and can proceed while also advancing organic growth opportunities at existing operations.\nAsset and Geographic Diversification \u2013 Josemaria adds meaningful-scale copper-gold production growth to Lundin Mining's portfolio, providing further geographic diversification while maintaining a favourable copper-dominant commodity mix.\nContinued Balance Sheet Strength and Attractive Direct Returns \u2013 The Transaction cash consideration will be financed with existing liquidity, which as at September 30, 2021, included cash and cash equivalents of nearly US$430 million and approximately US$780 million available for drawdown on the Company's credit facility. The Company expects to maintain its direct return of capital to shareholders under its dividend framework throughout the development of the Josemaria project.\nUpside Exploration Potential \u2013 Lundin Mining believes there is significant potential to further increase value over the longer-term leveraging its copper-focused exploration expertise. Exploration potential in a highly prospective and emerging district, combined with the large Mineral Resource base, position Josemaria as the center of gravity for future development and expansion.\nPeter Rockandel, President and CEO commented, \"The acquisition of the Josemaria project complements Lundin Mining's existing portfolio of high-quality mines and highlights our focus on disciplined copper-focused growth to create long-term shareholder value. Josemaria is a world-class copper-gold project that has many characteristics which makes it the ideal project, at the right time, for Lundin Mining to advance in the next phase of our growth. Building on our strengthened technical expertise, leveraging our financial strength, and drawing on Josemaria Resources' in-country knowledge, we believe this opportunity will create meaningful value for all stakeholders. The addition of Josemaria will elevate Lundin Mining's position to a major base metals producer with high-quality, low-cost copper exposure.\"\nJosemaria Copper-Gold Project Overview\nUnless otherwise noted, all information (including scientific and technical information) relating to the Josemaria Copper-Gold Project contained in this news release has been derived from or is based on the Josemaria Technical Report. Further details with respect to the Josemaria project are available in the Josemaria Technical Report prepared for Josemaria Resources and filed under Josemaria Resources' SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com. See \"Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource Estimates\" of this news release for information on preparation of Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resource estimates as defined by NI 43-101.\nLocated entirely within the San Juan Province of Argentina, the Josemaria project is expected to produce an average of 166,000 tonnes of copper, 331,000 oz of gold and 1.2 million oz of silver per year for the first three years. Over a 19-year mine life defined by the current Mineral Reserve estimate, average annual production is forecast to be 131,000 t of copper, 224,000 oz of gold and 1.0 million oz of silver at an average total cash cost of US$1.55/lb of copper equivalent.\nA feasibility study was completed on the project in November 2020, key operational findings of which are presented in the table at the end of this section. Upon completion of the Transaction, Lundin Mining plans to further review and undertake additional study work on the project development timeline, capital expenditure estimates, and economic estimates.\nThe project has been advancing through environmental approvals, and commercial and fiscal terms with federal and provincial authorities. The Environment and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) for the project was submitted in the first quarter of 2021. Josemaria Resources anticipates the ESIA and commercial and fiscal terms to be finalized in 2022, outlining a project timeline of approximately five years to commercial production.\nThe Josemaria deposit is classified as a porphyry copper-gold system. The deposit area measures approximately 1,500 m north-south by approximately 1,000 m east-west and 600 to 700 m vertically from surface, within a larger alteration footprint of up to 4 km north-south by 2 km east-west. The deposit remains open to the south, beneath a thickening cover of post mineral volcanic rocks and also at depth.\nThe project site has ready access to water, grid power, transportation and logistical infrastructure within San Juan Province, which are to be further developed within the project scope.\nProject Highlights:\nMining \u2013 Josemaria is to be developed as a large-scale open-pit with a low strip ratio of 0.98 over the 19-year mine life. Electrically powered hydraulic shovels are envisaged in combination with ultra-class 360-tonne haul trucks.\nProcessing \u2013 Mineral processing is to consist of a conventional crush, grind and flotation flowsheet producing a gold-rich copper concentrate. The concentrator is designed to treat sulphide ores at an average capacity of approximately 152,000 tpd, varying by ore type and characteristics over the life-of-mine.\nCopper Concentrate \u2013 Conventional sulphide flotation is to produce copper concentrate with significant gold by-product credit. The copper concentrate grade is expected to average approximately 27% copper, 14.2 g/t gold and 71.7 g/t silver over the life of the operation.\nOperating costs \u2013 Life-of-mine total cash cost is estimated to average US$1.55/lb of copper equivalent (co-product basis). Low overall operating costs can be attributed to the low strip ratio and lower cost of power and labour than many other established mining jurisdictions.\nMineral Reserves \u2013 Mineral Reserves are estimated by Josemaria Resources to be 1,012 Mt at an average grade of 0.30% copper, 0.22 g/t gold and 0.94 g/t silver, containing approximately 6.7 billion lb of copper, 7.0 million oz of gold and 30.7 million oz of silver estimated using a copper price of US$3.00/lb, gold price of US$1,500/oz and silver price of US$18.00/oz silver. The current Mineral Reserves support a 19-year operational life at the envisaged processing rate of an average of approximately 152,000 tpd.\nJosemaria November 2020 Feasibility Study Operational Highlights\nAverage Process Capacity | 152,000 tonnes/day | |\nMine Life | 19 years | |\nLife-of-Mine Mill Feed | 1,012 million tonnes | |\nLife-of-Mine Diluted Grades | 0.30% copper, 0.22 g/t gold, 0.94 g/t silver | |\nLife-of-Mine Strip Ratio (Waste:Ore) | 0.98:1 | |\nLife-of-Mine Average Process Recovery | 85.2% copper, 62.6% gold, 72.0% silver | |\nAverage Annual Payable Metal Production | First 3 Years | Life-of-Mine |\n166,000 tonnes copper | 131,000 tonnes copper | |\n331,000 oz gold | 224,000 oz gold | |\n1,248,000 oz silver | 1,048,000 oz silver | |\nTotal Cash Cost (co-product) | US$1.55/lb copper equivalent | |\nMetal Prices | US$3.00/lb copper, US$1,500/oz gold, US$18.00/oz silver |\nTransaction Overview\nThe Transaction will be effected by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement under the Canada Business Corporations Act and will require approval by (i) 66\u2154% of the votes cast by Josemaria Resources shareholders and (ii) 66\u2154% of the votes cast by Josemaria Resources security holders (comprised of shareholders and optionholders).\nUnder the terms of the Transaction, Josemaria Resources shareholders may elect to receive in exchange for each Josemaria Resources common share, 0.1487 of a Lundin Mining Share or C$1.60 cash or any combination thereof issuable to all Josemaria Resources shareholders. The Consideration will be subject to a total maximum cash consideration of approximately C$183 million and a total maximum share consideration of approximately 39.7 million Lundin Mining Shares, equating to 30% of the Transaction Consideration payable in cash and 70% of the transaction consideration payable in Lundin Mining Shares, respectively. In the event that the aggregate amount of the cash consideration or share consideration elected by all Josemaria Resources shareholders exceeds the respective limits, the Consideration will be pro-rated and Josemaria Resources shareholders will receive the other form of Consideration for the balance of their Josemaria Resources Shares.\nAny cash payments on Josemaria Resources Shares traded on Nasdaq Stockholm will be paid in Swedish kronor in accordance with Euroclear Sweden principles.\nThe Arrangement Agreement has been unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of each of Lundin Mining and Josemaria Resources, excluding (i) in the case of Lundin Mining, Messrs.

African governments desperate to recoup lost revenue are looking to Dubai to help stop the trade.\nInterviews with government officials across Africa reveal smuggling operations that span at least nine countries and involve tons of gold spirited over borders. That\u2019s a cause for international concern because the funds from contraband minerals dealing in Africa fuel conflict, finance criminal and terrorist networks, undermine democracy and facilitate money laundering, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.\nWhile it\u2019s impossible to say precisely how much is lost to smugglers each year, United Nations trade data for 2020 show a discrepancy of at least $4 billion between the United Arab Emirates\u2019 declared gold imports from Africa and what African countries say they exported to the UAE.\nThe UN and NGOs have long questioned the apparent role of one of the Emirates \u2014 Dubai \u2014 in facilitating the trade by closing its eyes to imports from dubious sources. The UAE strenuously denies any involvement in illegal practices. But as global scrutiny over corporate governance intensifies, the extent of the smuggling now under way poses increasingly uncomfortable questions for Dubai and its reputation as a gold trading hub.\nAllegations that it\u2019s not doing enough to stamp out questionable flows of the precious metal have led to public slanging matches with London, home to the world\u2019s largest gold market, and with Switzerland, the top refiner. Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo discussed concerns about gold smuggling with Emirati officials during a visit to Dubai and Abu Dhabi in mid-November, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified because they\u2019re not permitted to speak publicly about it.\nThat same week, the head of Dubai\u2019s commodities exchange, Ahmed bin Sulayem, answered the accusations head on.\n\u201cI want to address the elephant in the room: namely, the consistent and unsubstantiated attacks launched on Dubai by other trading centers and institutions,\u201d he said at a conference in the Emirates. They are, he said, \u201clies.\u201d\nAfrican governments are adding to the pressure. Besides Sudan, authorities in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zimbabwe, Mali, Ghana, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic and Niger complain that tons of gold leaks across their borders each year, and they allege most of it heads to Dubai.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge loss,\u201d Nigerian Mines Minister Olamilekan Adegbite said in an interview in his office in Abuja, the capital, where glass cabinets display rock samples that illustrate the nation\u2019s mining potential, so far largely untapped.\nThe bulk of Africa\u2019s illegally mined gold is channeled to Dubai through refineries in countries like Uganda and Rwanda, or is flown there directly in hand luggage, often with false papers, according to government and industry officials, UN experts and civil rights groups. Once there, it can be further melted down to obscure the source before being turned into jewelry, electronics or gold bars, they say.\n\u201cMost European countries will ask you for your certificates of export from the country of origin,\u201d said Adegbite. \u201cIf you do not have that, the gold is confiscated and returned back to source.\u201d\nOn paper, the UAE requires the same. \u201cBut, you see,\u201d Adegbite added, \u201cin Dubai they look the other way.\u201d\nThe UAE\u2019s foreign trade ministry declined to answer questions on gold from Africa. Bin Sulayem said in an interview that a global ban on gold hand-carried on airlines \u2014 a traditional means of smuggling \u2014 would fix the problem. \u201cWe have a better track record than any of the major cities,\u201d he said. \u201cThe main complaint we\u2019re getting is \u2018you\u2019re too tough.\u2019\u201d\nGold smuggling is an age-old practice, but it became all the more rewarding as the price of bullion soared to a record $2,075 an ounce in August 2020. The illicit trade has since taken off like never before in Africa and authorities there have made scant headway in reining it in, an analysis of publicly available data from governments and other sources show.\nSudan\u2019s Finance Ministry, for example, estimates that 80% of gold production goes unregistered. Rwanda is set to ship $732 million worth of the metal this year, more than two-and-a-half times the value of its 2019 exports, according to International Monetary Fund figures. That\u2019s despite Rwanda barely mining any gold of its own, prompting accusations from the government in neighboring Congo that the precious metal originates from its territory.\nRwanda is working to become a regional mineral processing hub, which accounts for its increased exports, Rwanda Mines, Petroleum and Gas Board said in a statement. It has invested in new facilities which \u201csource raw materials from local and regional operators in compliance with legal and regulatory requirements,\u201d the board said.\nReports from the UN and other sources point to 95% of production from east and central Africa ending up in Dubai. That\u2019s a potential problem because much of the region is designated by the OECD as a conflict or high-risk area, meaning companies are required to show that imported gold is responsibly sourced. The European Union brought in legislation this year aligning it with U.S. efforts to stem the trade. However, enforcement is notoriously difficult.\nUganda, one of Africa\u2019s main refiners of informal, or artisanal gold, more than doubled its exports this financial year to some $2.25 billion, central bank statistics show. Again, the UAE was by far the top destination, according to UN trade data. The UN has accused Uganda and Rwanda of trading in gold smuggled from neighboring eastern Congo, a region mired in conflict.\nIn an unprecedented move, the London Bullion Market Association, which regulates the world\u2019s biggest gold market, last year threatened to bar its accredited refineries from sourcing metal from countries that didn\u2019t meet its responsible sourcing standards. While it didn\u2019t name any state, Bin Sulayem issued a rebuke on behalf of Dubai, accusing the association of trying to undermine the UAE\u2019s gold market.\nThe UAE signed up to LBMA\u2019s recommendations and \u201chas long been cooperative with all international regulations and best practices including anti-money laundering efforts and unethical sourcing of gold,\u201d minister of state for foreign trade, Thani Al Zeyoudi, said in a statement to Bloomberg News. \u201cThe UAE is committed to embedding the very highest international gold standards.\u201d\nMore than 12 months later, the LBMA has yet to follow through on its threat. Sakhila Mirza, its general counsel, said the association is still assessing what the UAE has done to combat smuggling. The LMBA does see the need for urgency, but has to act within the rules, and \u201cdisengaging is the last step,\u201d Mirza said in an interview.\nDubai\u2019s long association with the gold trade is evident in its main market in the oldest part of the city, where scores of shops with elaborate window displays of glittering necklaces, bodices and sunglasses line a pedestrian walkway. Trading operations are conducted in an adjacent rabbit-warren of a building, where men run between small offices, some with reinforced security doors.\nSeveral traders who spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared repercussions said they risked having their supply cut off by Emirati refineries if they asked too many questions about where it came from. Still, controls have been tightened to tackle money laundering, with customers who spend more than $15,000 required to submit their identity documents and source of funds.\nDuring his visit last month, the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Adeyemo noted that stronger enforcement efforts targeting illicit finance could give the UAE a competitive advantage in the region, according to the two people with knowledge of the talks. The Treasury Department declined to comment through a spokesperson for the Office of Foreign Assets Control, who asked not to be named due to the sensitive nature of sanctions policy.\nThani Al Zeyoudi told reporters last month that Dubai will introduce a publicly accessible system for monitoring imports and exports of gold, and the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre\u2019s \u201cGood Delivery Standard,\u201d will be rolled out nationwide \u2014 if only on a voluntary basis. All gold refineries in the UAE will be required to conduct audits that prove bullion deliveries are responsibly sourced, starting in February, the Economy Ministry said in a statement in December.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to be a real hub when it comes to gold trading,\u201d Thani Al Zeyoudi said. \u201cSo we welcome the world, we welcome anyone who wants to do trade and we want to make sure that we adhere to the international standards through the delivery standards.\u201d\nIn October, Switzerland\u2019s State Secretariat for Economic Affairs instructed Swiss refineries to take steps to identify the true country of origin for all gold emanating from the UAE, saying that was necessary to ensure they weren\u2019t being sent illicit supplies. Bin Sulayem again took to LinkedIn to say the Emirates enforced the OECD\u2019s guidelines on sourcing minerals and accused the Swiss authorities of hypocrisy.\nMichael Bartlett-Vanderpuye, the chairman of M&C Group Global, which mines and sources gold from Ghana that\u2019s mainly sold to clients in the UAE, described the clashes with London and Switzerland as \u201can international gold power play\u201d with each center protecting its turf.\n\u201cI always found it very difficult to believe that people are actually able to bring gold to the UAE without the documentation,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I look at the system at the airport, I find it near to impossible.\u201d\nSwiss refiner Metalor Technologies SA remains skeptical.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t think everything coming from Dubai is illegal, but we have doubts about the legitimacy of some of the integrity of the supply chain,\u201d Jose Camino, Metalor\u2019s group general counsel, said in an interview. \u201cWe are happy to pass it by.\u201d\nDubai\u2019s supporters claim African customs data aren\u2019t reliable and even the UN can\u2019t accurately measure illicit trade flows. Behind closed doors, UAE officials point the finger at their counterparts in Africa and forgers who obscure the gold\u2019s origins by issuing documents that are impossible to distinguish from the real thing.\nThat\u2019s little comfort to the authorities in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a vast central African country that\u2019s struggling to rebuild after more than two decades of conflict. It has some of the world\u2019s richest reserves, including Kibali in the northeast of the country \u2014 Africa\u2019s biggest gold mine \u2014 yet, perversely, the DRC is one of the biggest losers of the illicit gold trade.\nAn army of small-scale miners operate below the government\u2019s radar, but data show the informal industry generated just $2.4 million in official gold exports last year. Statistics from the UN and IMF suggest the fruits of their labor slipped across the border instead: Uganda and Rwanda shipped bullion worth $1.8 billion and $648 million respectively in 2020, despite having little gold of their own.\n\u201cIt\u2019s ours,\u201d Congolese Finance Minister Nicolas Kazadi said in an interview at his office in the capital, Kinshasa. \u201cIt\u2019s gold from Congo.\u201d\nUnder U.S. law, gold from Congo and its neighbors is considered a \u201cconflict mineral,\u201d meaning companies publicly traded in the U.S. are required to report to the Securities Exchange Commission if they might be using gold mined in conflict areas \u2014 but there\u2019s no sanction for doing so. A June report by UN experts found that much of the illegal gold trade in Congo is overseen by armed groups or soldiers, who traffic it across the borders or fly it directly to Dubai using forged documents to obscure its origin.\nRelated Story: From Minerals to Beer, Congo Finance Minister Hunts for Cash\nSasha Lezhnev, policy consultant for Washington-based anti-corruption group The Sentry, said that refiners trading in conflict gold aren\u2019t being held publicly accountable by the UAE. \u201cDubai is the linchpin for change in the gold trade in east and central Africa,\u201d he said.\nSmuggling is also troubling the government in Nigeria, where most minerals are extracted by at least 100,000 informal miners whose operations are difficult to regulate and tax. Formal gold production totaled just 1,288 kilograms last year, almost all of which went to Dubai, according to Nigerian government data.\nEfforts are being made to formalize the industry. Fatima Shinkafi is head of the Presidential Artisanal Gold Mining Initiative, which has registered 10,000 informal miners and is developing a supply chain whereby their output will be sent to LBMA-certified refineries in Europe, processed and transferred to the central bank to boost Nigeria\u2019s foreign reserves.\nAdegbite, the mines minister, wants to work with the UAE to combat smuggling, and says he even proposed to his government that it split the proceeds \u201c50-50\u201d with the Emirati authorities of any undeclared Nigerian gold recovered. The UAE Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation didn\u2019t respond to emailed requests for comment on the minister\u2019s proposal.\nIn Sudan, more than 2 million small-scale miners produce some 80% of the nation\u2019s gold. They are paid about a quarter less for what they extract than it would fetch on international markets and are charged a $64 tax on each ounce of output, which encourages some to bypass official trading channels.\nSome of Sudan\u2019s internal trade happens in a dank six-story building in downtown Khartoum, the capital, where men melt rough nuggets into bars and dealers can be seen exiting the premises carrying piles of cash wrapped in cling film. Illicitly traded gold is flown to Dubai through the porous international airport or trafficked into neighboring Egypt, Ethiopia and Chad, according to industry experts.\nPolitical upheaval has frustrated efforts to ensure Sudan\u2019s people benefit from its mineral endowment. Dictator Omar al-Bashir was toppled in a popular uprising in 2019, then a transitional government was overthrown in an Oct. 25 coup as the military reasserted itself.\nThe security forces have set up road blocks between mining areas and Khartoum to combat smuggling. But controls remain woefully inadequate, according to Dafalla Idriss, the deputy chair of a panel in River Nile state set up to freeze assets plundered by the al-Bashir regime.\n\u201cThere is corruption inside all government institutions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe gold that leaves the country is getting past everyone.\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nStop With the Covid Excuses, Already\u2014Customers Have Caught On\nHow to \u2018See\u2019 Time: The Secret to Peak Entrepreneur Productivity\nThe Super League Debacle Forced Manchester United\u2019s American Owners to Listen to Fans\nBright Horizons Is Betting Kids Will Return to the Office, Even If Parents Stay Home\n\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.",

The Company is awaiting results from the remaining drillholes, PAU21004 and PAU21005.\nThis current drill program represents phase one (\u201cPhase I\u201d) of a two phase 1,500 m maiden drill program (the \u201cProgram\u201d) that will be completed early summer 2022. Phase I drilling of the program was completed at the end of November, and in agreement with the local reindeer husbandry, Phase II will commence once the reindeer have left the area.\nDH PAU 21003 targeted a gold-in-bedrock anomaly of 1.43 g/t Au, previously identified at Paub\u00e4cken\u2019s Aida target in fall 2021, as a result of a base of till/top of bedrock (\u201cBoT/ToB\u201d) drilling and sampling program (Figures 1 and 2). This target was \u201cblind\u201d in the sense that all bedrock in the area is covered by a veneer of glacial till, and there is no bedrock exposure in the target area. The 22.5m intercept within DH PAU21003 is hosted by a strongly sheared amphibolite with intense biotite and calc-silicate alteration. The entire thickness of the amphibolite intersection was mineralized, which suggests there is additional exploration potential in other similar amphibolite units and structural targets. The Company is highly encouraged by the 53.9 gram-meter (grade thickness)1 intercept in DH21003 and plans to utilize these early exploration results to refine additional targets for Phase II of the drill program.\nZones of anomalous gold were also intersected in DH PAU21002, which was drilled approximately 450 meters to the southeast of DH PAU21003. This includes a sample with 0.55 g/t Au and numerous samples in the 0.1-0.5 g/t Au range. While not as enriched as the zone of mineralization intercepted in PAU21003, the mineralized intervals in PAU21002 also showed intense biotite and calc-silicate alteration as well as narrow amphibolite zones.

The Gold Line Belt is host to several significant gold deposits, including the nearby Barsele project (operated as a joint venture between Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. and Barsele Minerals Corp) as well as the Svartliden mine and F\u00e4boliden development project (operated by Dragon Mining Ltd). The Paub\u00e4cken Project is strategically positioned between Barsele and F\u00e4boliden, and a few hundred meters north east of the Svartliden mine and features a regional shear zone with multiple untested gold anomalies.\nSampling:\nSamples were collected in accordance with industry standard best practices. Samples were collected by Arctic Drilling AS and submitted for preparation at the MSALABS in Storuman, Sweden. Accredited control samples (blanks and accredited standards) are inserted into the sample intervals regularly. Drill core is sawed with a semi-automatic core saw, then core samples are crushed to a 70% pass 2mm, split (1000g), and pulverized to 85% passing 75\u00b5m (SAW-100 and PRP-920, respectively). Pulps are analyzed at the MSALABS in Langley, BC, Canada with a four-acid digestion and ICP-MS/AES finish (IMS-230) as well with a 30g Fire Assay and ICP-AES finish for gold analysis (FAS-114). A gravimetric determination for samples above 10g/t Au is used (FAS-415).\nComments on Nearby Mines and Deposits\nThe nearby mines and deposits discussed in this news release provide context for Company\u2019s Paub\u00e4cken Project, which occurs in a similar geologic setting, but this is not necessarily indicative that the Project hosts similar styles, grades and tonnages of mineralization.\nQualified Person:\nThe technical information in this news release has been prepared in accordance with the Canadian regulatory requirements set out in National Instrument 43-101 and reviewed and approved by Michael Dufresne, M.Sc., P.Geol., P.Geo., a Qualified Person.\nAbout Gold Line Resources Ltd.\nGold Line Resources is focused on acquiring mineral properties with exceptional exploration potential in the most prolific gold-producing regions of Fennoscandia, and further delineating the historic.

Here\u2019s What That Means for You\nPutin Satisfied With Biden Call, Sets Stage for Security Talks\nUnder new guidelines issued by the central bank, the so-called conversion rate will be set using foreign-exchange buying rates announced six times a day instead of once a day. The rate is used to measure the lira\u2019s level against major currencies at the opening date of new accounts.\nA similar change also applies to deposits whose returns are linked to the price of gold, another instrument that aims to encourage citizens to convert to liras from gold-based deposits. The end-of-maturity rate will be based on the buying rate at 11 a.m. local time.\nErdogan urged citizens to convert foreign currencies to liras on Friday, also calling on those keeping gold at homes to put their savings in the banking system. \u201cInterest is the reason and inflation is the result,\u201d he said in Istanbul, adding that those who think the opposite is true are acting with \u201cthe capitalist logic of the West.\u201d Islamic teachings provide a \u201cweapon\u201d against those who attack Turkey through exchange rates, he said.\nThe president unveiled an emergency plan on Dec. 20 to curb the lira\u2019s unprecedented depreciation and protect investors against swings in the currency. One measure guarantees that returns on lira-denominated deposits wouldn\u2019t fall short of bank interest rates, in an effort to end current spot demand for foreign exchange.\nHow Erdogan\u2019s Plan to Halt the Lira\u2019s Fall Is Meant to Work\nThe lira recovered some of its losses in December after Erdogan introduced the mechanism. However, the currency remains about 31% weaker than it was on Sept. 23, when the central bank started cutting interest rates. It remains the worst performer among emerging-market currencies against the dollar this year, with a slump of around 43%.\n\u201cIf parts of the system are continuously amended, people may opt to wait for a more advantageous change,\u201d said Ozlem Derici Sengul, founding partner of Istanbul-based Spinn Consulting. \u201cWe\u2019re going through a serious lira liquidity crunch and the only way to boost the lira base is this mechanism. Unless it works quickly, loan rates will not decline.\u201d\nSpeaking in a TV interview on Dec. 29, Treasury and Finance Minister Nureddin Nebati said the amount citizens deposited under the new system reached 59.8 billion liras (about $4.5 billion).\nThe lira weakened 0.8% to 13.2598 per dollar at 2:35 p.m. on Friday, its fifth day of decline. The currency depreciated 44% in 2021, the worst performer among emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.\n(Updates with Erdogan\u2019s comments in fourth, prices in final paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nWhat Really Happens When Workers Are Given a Flexible Hybrid Schedule?\nHow to \u2018See\u2019 Time: The Secret to Peak Entrepreneur Productivity\nStop With the Covid Excuses, Already\u2014Customers Have Caught On\nThe Super League Debacle Forced Manchester United\u2019s American Owners to Listen to Fans\n\u00a92021 Bloomberg L.P.",

Please see Southern Empire's news release of July 27, 2021, for further details.\nIn the Cargo Muchacho mountains of Imperial County, California, Southern Empire owns 100 percent of the historical gold-producing American Girl mine property and holds options to acquire a 100 percent interest in the adjacent 2,160-hectare (5,338-acre) Oro Cruz property located approximately 22.5 kilometres (14 miles) southeast of the operating Mesquite gold mine of Equinox Gold Corp.\nAt Oro Cruz, extensive historical drilling and large-scale open-pit and underground mining of the American Girl, Padre y Madre, Queen, and Cross oxide gold deposits by the American Girl Mining Joint Venture (AGMJV; ultimately owned 53 percent by MK Gold Company and 47 percent by Hecla Mining Company) occurred between 1987 and 1996. During that time, gold was recovered by either heap leaching of lower-grade, or milling of higher-grade ores until AGMJV operations ceased in late 1996 because of declining gold prices leaving the Oro Cruz property with many gold exploration targets in addition to the historical inferred resource estimate, reported In 2011 by Lincoln Mining Corp., totaling 341,800 ounces gold based on 4,386,000 tonnes averaging 2.2 grams gold per tonne (g/t Au) at a cut-off grade of 0.68 g/t Au (4,835,000 tons at 0.07 ounce gold per ton; Please refer to the Cautionary Notice Regarding the Oro Cruz Property Historical Resource Estimate below).\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors of Southern Empire Resources Corp.,\nDale Wallster, CEO and Director\nFor further information on Southern Empire please visit: www.smp.gold and SEDAR or contact: Lubica Keighery, (778) 889-5476, lubica@smp.gold .\nCautionary Notice on Forward-Looking Information\nInformation provided in this news release may contain forward-looking information or forward-looking statements that are based on assumptions as of the date of this news release. Such information or statements reflect management's current estimates, beliefs, intentions, and expectations and are not guarantees of future performance. Southern Empire cautions that all forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and that actual performance may be affected by many material factors, many of which are beyond its respective control. Such factors include, among other things: risks and uncertainties relating to Southern Empire's limited operating history, the need to comply with environmental and governmental regulations, results of exploration programs on its projects, and those risks and uncertainties identified in its annual and interim financial statements and management discussion and analysis. Accordingly, actual and future events, conditions, and results may differ materially from the estimates, beliefs, intentions, and expectations expressed or implied in the forward-looking information. Except as required under applicable securities legislation, Southern Empire undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise forward-looking information.\nCautionary Notice Regarding Historical Resource Estimate\nThe Oro Cruz Project historical resource estimate outlined above is disclosed in a technical report dated April 29, 2011, prepared for Lincoln Mining Corp. by Tetra Tech, Inc. and filed on Canadian Securities Administrators' System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (SEDAR). It is termed an inferred mineral resource, which is a category set out in NI 43-101. It was based on historical reverse circulation and core drill hole sample, underground channel sample, and blasthole sample assay results and calculated using ordinary kriging to estimate gold grades in 10-foot-by-10-foot-by-five-foot blocks. Accordingly, Southern Empire considers this historical estimate reliable as well as relevant as it represents key targets for future exploration work. However, a QP has not done sufficient work to verify or classify the historical estimate as a current mineral resource and Southern Empire is not treating this historical estimate as current mineral resources.\nWork Programs During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe timing of Southern Empire's exploration programs will be contingent on governmental regulations regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and also the availability of exploration-related personnel, drill contractors, equipment, lodging, et cetera. Southern Empire will adhere to COVID-19 directives regarding safe working practices putting worker, community and national safety first and will proceed with exploration and development work programs only if potential COVID-19 risks can be effectively managed.\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the Exchange) accept responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nSOURCE Southern Empire Resources Corp.\nView original content to download multimedia: http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/January2022/18/c2193.html",

A price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 7.6 times for 2022 sits well below the widely-regarded bargain benchmark of 10 times. Its dividend yield meanwhile comes in at a meaty 4.2%.\nWhy the oil price rally could end\nI have serious reservations about investing in BP however. Energy prices are soaring today but fresh trouble in the battle against Covid-19 could send them tumbling again.\nLet\u2019s not forget the public health crisis is far from finished. Rocketing global inflation and China\u2019s teetering real estate sector are additional threats to the economic recovery that could pull prices lower again.\nOn top of this, energy values could suffer a sharp turnaround if producers continue to hurriedly raise output. The number of US rigs in operation has risen in four of the last five weeks, according to Baker Hughes.\nIn fact the number of working oil and gas rigs last week rose at their fastest pace since April. It\u2019s possible that oil prices could start reflecting speculation that declining stockpiles might begin to build strongly again.\nThe green revolution\nAs a long-term investor, I prefer to think about what a company\u2019s share price will be doing in several years time. Unfortunately, in the case of BP, I think the spectre of massive oversupply looms dominates its outlook for the next 10 years.\nMassive fossil fuel investment in recent years looks set to yield fruit sooner rather than later too. In the US, for example, the Energy Information Administration has tipped annual production to hit record highs of 12.4m barrels a day in 2023.\nHuge spending by other major oil producers like Canada, Brazil and Norway also threatens to drown the market with excess oil.\nIn another worrying development, soaring investment in green technologies threatens to sink crude demand as the decade progresses. People are shunning gas-guzzling cars and buying electric vehicles at a jaw-dropping rate. At the same time, demand for renewable energy is rising sharply as concerns over the climate crisis worsen.\nBP is taking steps to improve its own green credentials to address this long-term threat. This week, for instance, it signed a deal with Oman to explore building multiple gigawatts of electricity from wind, solar and green hydrogen projects by 2030. But BP\u2019s exposure to low-carbon energy remains meagre and it has a long way (and a lot of money to spend) to catch up.\nA better FTSE 100 stock to buy?\nI believe Tesco (LSE: TSCO) could prove a better FTSE 100 share to buy than BP. Okay, its heyday of the early 2000s might be over, a time when \u00a31 of every \u00a38 spent in the UK found its way into the company\u2019s tills.\nBut the business still sits at the top of the country\u2019s grocery industry, has the clout and, thanks to its long-running Clubcard reward scheme, a large and loyal customer base to fall back on.\nI also like Tesco because of the strength of its online offering. It has the best delivery operation in the business and vast investment here since the beginning of the pandemic has boosted its strength.\nThis puts Tesco in great shape to exploit the fast-growing online grocery segment. Analysts at IGD think this segment could be worth \u00a326.9bn by 2026, up \u00a34.7bn from last year\u2019s levels.\nRising competition\nThat said, Tesco also faces significant problems of its own. Supply chain problems for example threaten to remain a long-term problem as post-Brexit customs changes come into effect. A smaller pool of workers to draw on due to tightening immigration rules also threatens to drive up costs and cause disruption.\nMy main fear for Tesco however, comes as its competitors expand rapidly to grab its customers. All of its established rivals including Sainsbury\u2019s and Morrisons now operate sophisticated online operations of their own. US retail giant Amazon has also dipped its toe in the water in the UK, and German discounter Aldi now operates a \u2018click and collect\u2019 service of its own.\nThe danger posed by Aldi and its German counterpart Lidl are particularly concerning to me. Their rapid store rollouts come at a time when value is becoming increasingly important to British consumers.\nIGD expects discounts to be the fastest-growing part of the grocery market in the years ahead. They think it\u2019ll be worth \u00a334.4bn by 2026, up \u00a36.6bn from 2021. News that inflation in the UK has hit 30-year highs could hasten the flow from Tesco to these low-cost retailers too.\nShould I buy Tesco shares?\nJust like BP, Tesco\u2019s share price also seems to offer excellent value on paper. The retailer trades on a forward price-to-earnings growth (PEG) ratio of 0.2, comfortably below the watermark of 1 that suggests a stock could be undervalued. However, this low valuation reflects the colossal (and growing) long-term threats to Tesco\u2019s profits.\nThere are plenty of other cheap UK and US for me to choose from today. So I won\u2019t be taking a risk by buying Tesco or BP.\nThe post Tesco vs BP: which cheap FTSE 100 share should I buy right now? appeared first on The Motley Fool UK.\nMore reading\nJohn Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.

Shares of bank stocks including Bank of America Corp, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo added over 1% each ahead of a U.S. inflation reading due this week.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.06% to end at 35,462.78 points. The S&P 500 gained 0.84% to 4,521.52.\nThe Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.28% to 14,194.46.\nA jump in U.S. Treasury yields lifted bank stocks on Wall Street. Shares of Bank of America Corp BAC.N, JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N and Wells Fargo WFC.N all gained over 1%.\nEurope's benchmark STOXX 600 finished flat with tech stocks among the weakest performers, pressured by rising bond yields. Oil and gas stocks sank 1.8%, tracking a drop in crude prices. FTSE-listed BP fell over 2% even after reporting a $12.8 billion annual profit. [.EU]\nThe MSCI world equity index rose 0.52%.\n\"Earnings season has been top of mind for market participants for the past few weeks. Results have been, on balance, better than estimates,\" Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York, said in a note.\n\"As we wrap up the earnings season this week, investors focus will likely shift from the micro corporate earnings to the macro like the Federal Reserve, particularly pertaining to the pace of interest-rate rises and how to manage the balance sheet,\" Hogan added, pointing to expectations for as many as five Fed rate hikes.\nLAGARDE COMMENTS\nThe euro weakened for a second straight day, pressured by comments on Monday from ECB President Christine Lagarde that there was currently no need for major tightening.\nCurrency and bond market traders are focused on which central banks will hike interest rates fastest and furthest this year following the rapid rise in global inflation.\nThe euro was down 0.21 percent, at $1.1418 by 4:25 p.m. EST (2125 GMT).\nThe dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, gained 0.198 points or 0.21 percent, to 95.597.\nThe yen rose 0.34 percent, at $115.5100.\nThe benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit its highest since November 2019 on Tuesday, ahead of a key inflation reading this week and expectations that the Fed will start tightening.

The company\u2019s travel-related offerings cover hotel rooms, airline tickets, rental cars, vacation packages, cruises, \u201cthings to do\u201d at customer destinations and travel insurance.\nThe company has agreements with hotels, airlines companies, cruise ships, transport companies and vacation providers, which enable it to accept bookings on their behalf. Information on these offerings and customer reviews are available on the company\u2019s owned or operated websites, thus helping customers take informed decisions.\nServices in the U.S. are provided through the Booking Holdings.com website. The company employs two marketing strategies in the U.S.\u2014\u201cprice-disclosed\u201d and \u201cname your own price\u201d or \u201copaque\u201d.\nInternational revenues are generated through Booking.com and Agoda. Booking.com is older and therefore, has more patrons. Agoda is an Asian company acquired in 2007. Booking Holdings\u2019s investment in Chinese travel company Ctrip facilitates the use of each other\u2019s inventories in China and the U.S.\nInternational results are comprised of revenues from rentalcars.com and Kayak. While rentalcars.com allows it to take rental car reservations, Kayak enables comparative shopping of Booking Holdings inventories. The acquisition of OpenTable that has allowed it to expand into restaurant reservations space, also contributes to the international revenues.\nBooking Holdings distributes its services through merchant (31.2% of 2020 total revenues) and agency channels (63.5% of 2020 revenues). It also generates around 5.3% of 2020 revenues through advertisements on its websites, classified as the Advertising & Other category.\nThe agency model is more lucrative for the company. It generates revenues from travel-related transactions which include travel reservation commissions, GDS reservation booking fees and certain travel insurance fees.\nMerchant model revenues are also derived from travel-related transactions which include ancillary fees, credit card processing rebates, customer processing fees along with the ones included in agency model.\nAdvertising & Other revenues are generated from KAYAK and Open Table.",

Here\u2019s why I\u2019d buy them today.\nReady to shine\nI think Serabi Gold (LSE: SRB) is a great defensive share to own as insurance for when times go bad. History shows that on average a bear market happens every seven years or so. So there\u2019s a pretty good chance that having exposure to gold \u2014 an asset which tends to rise strongly when economic conditions become tough \u2014 will pay off big time.\nMy main concern with owning Serabi shares is the possibility that central banks might raise rates more sharply than expected. Such a scenario would curb inflation, a natural driver for precious metal prices. On Thursday, US Federal Reserve official James Bullard said he\u2019d like to see the central bank raise interest rates by a further 1% between now and July. This could be seriously damaging for precious metal values.\nHowever, from a long-term perspective I still think Serabi Gold\u2019s an attractive share to own. Forget for a moment its role as an insurance policy for investors. I\u2019m looking beyond the possibility that gold prices could march higher if inflationary pressure keeps increasing.\nI\u2019m encouraged by the significant improvement of grades at Serabi\u2019s Palito gold mine and the promising results from recent exploration work there. And I\u2019m excited as the business prepares to start constructing its Coringa asset later this year. Serabi hopes to eventually produce 100,000 ounces of the yellow metal each year (the Brazilian miner produced 33,848 ounces in 2021).\nAt current prices of 54.5p per share Serabi trades on a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 4.7 times. I think this is far too cheap given the company\u2019s impressive production performance of late and its bright growth prospects. City analysts think earnings will rise 4% in 2022 before shooting 29% higher next year.\nAnother dirt-cheap penny stock I\u2019d buy\nI believe DP Eurasia (LSE: DPEU) is another bargain penny stock worth serious attention today. Forecasters think earnings here will rise around 500% in 2022 and by a further 50% next year. This leaves the takeaway giant trading on a forward price-to-earnings growth (PEG) ratio of 0.1 at its current price of 81p. A reminder that any reading below 1 suggests a stock could be undervalued.\nI like DP Eurasia for various reasons. The online food delivery market is expected to continue rising strongly in the post-pandemic era. Growth is tipped to be especially strong in emerging markets where personal wealth levels are rising, too. Indeed, sales at DP Eurasia \u2014 which operates in Turkey, Russia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia \u2014 soared 51.5% in 2021.\nI\u2019m also a big fan of DP Eurasia because its products are especially popular with the public. As the master franchisee of the Domino\u2019s Pizza brand in all four of its markets, it commands a considerable brand power advantage over its rivals. It\u2019s true that the business operates in a highly-competitive arena. And consequently it will have to work tirelessly to grow profits. But I still think it could significantly bolster my wealth in the years ahead.\nThe post 2 cheap penny stocks that could significantly grow my wealth! appeared first on The Motley Fool UK.\nMore reading\nRoyston Wild has no position in any of the shares mentioned.

Recent drilling targeted up-dip and down dip extensions to the resource area along with a number of holes directed at initial testing of a sub-parallel structure located approximately 200 metres east of the main structure.\nAdditional RC drilling on the principal structure, which hosts a portion of the existing pit-constrained resource, tested 500 metres of strike length (18 holes drilled - SWRC143 to SWRC148, SWRC156 to SWRC166, and SWRC169). Hole SWRC164 intersected a shallow gold mineralized structure within the oxidized portion of the deposit grading 1.98 g/t Au over 25.0 m from 3 m, and a second zone of 0.58 g/t Au over 22.0 m from 48 m in the sulphides (hole ended in mineralization). Hole SWRC165, drilled on the same section as SWRC164, intersected mineralization down dip returning 1.31 g/t Au over 18 m from 73 m, including 8.28 g/t Au over 2 m from 83 m.\nHole SWRC160, collared 250 metres north of SWRC164, tested the down dip extension of the Sewum structure and intersected 2.14 g/t Au over 18.0 m from 123 m, including 3.01 g/t Au over 4.0 m from 124 m and 2.87 g/t Au over 7.0 m from 129 m (sulphide zone). Additional drilling included hole SWRC144 which intersected 1.72 g/t Au over 13 m from 81 m (sulphide zone) and SWRC143 which intersected 1.49 g/t Au over 14 m from 5 m (oxide zone).\nStrong results were also encountered in first pass drilling that was completed on an undrilled target at Sewum, sub-parallel structures defined by gold-in-soil and trench anomalies located approximately 200 metres east of the main Sewum structure (10 holes drilled - SWRC149 to SWRC155, SWRC167, SWRC168, and SWRC170). Hole SWRC152 intersected 5.84 g/t Au over 6.0 m from 2 m, including 26.82 g/t Au over 1.0 m from 2 m (oxide zone). Hole SWRC151, drilled on the same section as SWRC152, tested the down dip extension and intersected two gold mineralized structures grading 1.10 g/t Au over 10.0 m from 29 m in the oxides and 0.67 g/t Au over 20.0 m from 72 m including 1.23 g/t Au over 5.0 m from 79 m in the sulphides. Hole SWRC168, drilled on the adjacent section south of SWRC151/152 located 200 metres south, intersected a series of gold mineralized zones including 0.48 g/t Au over 4.0 m from 4 m in the oxides, 0.85 g/t Au over 12.0 m from 35 m in the oxide-sulphide transition, and two zones in the sulphides grading 0.70 g/t Au over 13.0 m from 72 m and 0.49 g/t Au over 9.0 m from 91 m. Hole SWRC155, drilled on the adjacent section north of SWRC151/152 located 200 metres north, intersected a series of gold mineralized zones with 0.51 g/t Au over 1.0 m from 49 m, 0.41 g/t Au over 9.0 m from 111 m, and 0.43 g/t Au over 2.0 m from 124 m (sulphide zone). These new sub-parallel structures have now been tested for over 400 metres of strike length and are open to both the north and south, representing a new area for potential resource growth at Sewum.\nDrilling at Eradi\nDiamond drilling was completed on the Eradi Gold Target following up on positive drilling and trenching completed prior to 2020. Eradi is an earlier stage target at Enchi with no defined mineral resource. 14 DD holes totalling 2,189.5 m (ERDD011 to ERDD023) tested approximately 1.2 kilometres of strike length, with all holes intersecting gold mineralization. Hole ERDD020, completed on the northern portion of the zone, intersected multiple gold mineralized zones within the oxides including a wide zone with high-grade core structures which returned 0.89 g/t Au over 47.8 m from 41.2 m, including 6.44 g/t Au over 2.5 m from 41.2 m and 2.14 g/t Au over 5.8 m from 54.2 m. Hole ERDD020 also encountered additional near surface structures including 0.31 g/t Au over 1.0 m from 10 m and 0.43 g/t Au over 4.5 m from 15.2 m.\nHole ERDD015, collared one kilometre south of ERDD020 on the southern portion of the zone, intersected a series of gold mineralized structures including 0.87 g/t Au over 4.6 m from 9.7 m and 0.61 g/t Au over 7.1 m from 65.8 m, and 0.93 g/t Au over 2.2 m from 105.6 m in the oxides.\nWork completed at Eradi prior to 2020 included trenching and drilling, with prior trenching returning 1.67 g/t Au over 36.9 m and 10 wide spaced shallow drill holes intersecting gold mineralized intervals of 0.60 g/t Au over 27.0 m from 25 m including 1.30 g/t Au over 10.0 m from 42 m, 1.15 g/t Au over 10.0 m from 58 m, 0.60 g/t Au over 17.0 m from 5 m, and 1.02 g/t Au over 10.0 m from 22 m.\nEnchi Gold Project Mineral Resource Estimate\nThe Enchi Gold Project hosts a pit constrained Inferred Mineral Resource of 70.4 million tonnes grading 0.62 g/t Au containing 1.41 million ounces gold (see Newcore news release dated June 8, 2021). Mineral resource estimation practices are in accordance with CIM Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Best Practice Guidelines (November 29, 2019) and follow CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (May 10, 2014), that are incorporated by reference into National Instrument 43-101 (\"NI 43-101\"). The Mineral Resource Estimate was prepared by independent qualified person Todd McCracken, P. Geo. of BBA E&C Inc. The technical report, titled \"Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Enchi Gold Project, Enchi, Ghana\" has an effective date of June 8, 2021, and is available under the Company\u2019s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.\n2020 - 2021 Enchi Drilling Program\nA 90,000 metre discovery and resource expansion drilling program is underway at Enchi (anticipated completion in Q2 2022). The program includes both RC and diamond drilling and includes the first deeper drilling on the Project. This drill program includes testing extensions of the existing resource areas while also testing a number of high priority exploration targets outside of the Inferred Mineral Resource. Drilling is focused on step out extensions and exploration drilling at the Sewum, Boin, Nyam and Kwakyekrom Deposits. Additional drilling is also focused on previously drilled zones that are outside of the resource area (Kojina Hill and Eradi), along with first pass drilling to test a series of kilometre-scale gold-in-soil anomalous zones with no prior drilling (Nkwanta, Sewum South and other anomalies). All zones represent high priority targets based on geological, geochemical and geophysical surface work and previous trenching and drilling.\nSewum Gold Zone\nThe Sewum Gold Deposit is the largest of the four deposits which comprise the pit constrained Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate at Enchi, with Sewum hosting approximately 51% of the currently defined resource (41.0 million tonnes grading 0.55 g/t Au containing 725,200 ounces). Sewum is located 15 kilometres south of the town of Enchi, with nearby roads and power and further access provided by a series of drill roads. Sewum is outlined on surface by a six-kilometre-long and one-to-two-kilometre-wide gold in soil anomaly. An airborne geophysical anomaly coincident with the Sewum Deposit defines a series of sub parallel and intersecting structures. Approximately 50% of the gold-in-soil anomaly is untested by drilling. As part of the current drill program results have been received and released for a total of 85 holes representing 15,420 metres at Sewum.\nEradi Gold Target\nThe Eradi Gold Zone is the northernmost drill tested target at Enchi, with no currently defined Mineral Resource Estimate. Eradi is located 25 kilometres northeast of the town of Enchi, with nearby roads and power and further access provided by a series of drill roads. Eradi is outlined on surface by a four-kilometre-long and one-kilometre-wide gold in soil anomaly. An airborne geophysical anomaly coincident with the Eradi Gold Target defines a series of sub parallel and intersecting structures. Approximately 60% of the gold-in-soil anomaly is untested by drilling. As part of the current drill program a total of 14 holes totalling 2,189.5 metres have been completed at Eradi.\nDrill Hole Locations\nTable 2 - Enchi Gold Project Drill Hole Location Details\n| Hole ID | UTM East | UTM North | Elevation | Azimuth \u00b0 | Dip \u00b0 | Length (m) | |\n| SWRC143 | 520505 | 626275 | 122 | 120 | -55 | 50 | |\n| SWRC144 | 520501 | 626343 | 118 | 120 | -60 | 120 | |\n| SWRC145 | 520569 | 626355 | 113 | 120 | -55 | 70 | |\n| SWRC146 | 520550 | 626367 | 120 | 120 | -55 | 100 | |\n| SWRC147 | 520615 | 626387 | 108 | 120 | -55 | 40 | |\n| SWRC148 | 520576 | 626411 | 105 | 120 | -65 | 110 | |\n| SWRC149 | 520996 | 626322 | 98 | 120 | -50 | 100 | |\n| SWRC150 | 520893 | 626162 | 97 | 120 | -50 | 102 | |\n| SWRC151 | 520775 | 626215 | 130 | 120 | -50 | 102 | |\n| SWRC152 | 520831 | 626189 | 189 | 120 | -50 | 100 | |\n| SWRC153 | 520845 | 626392 | 110 | 120 | -50 | 108 | |\n| SWRC154 | 520779 | 626420 | 117 | 120 | -50 | 114 | |\n| SWRC155 | 520915 | 626351 | 94 | 120 | -50 | 130 | |\n| SWRC156 | 520654 | 626422 | 98 | 120 | -55 | 50 | |\n| SWRC157 | 520589 | 626463 | 89 | 120 | -55 | 120 | |\n| SWRC158 | 520623 | 626437 | 87 | 120 | -55 | 100 | |\n| SWRC159 | 520522 | 626383 | 113 | 120 | -55 | 140 | |\n| SWRC160 | 520491 | 626397 | 117 | 120 | -55 | 160 | |\n| SWRC161 | 520491 | 626397 | 117 | 120 | -60 | 40 | |\n| SWRC162 | 520393 | 626096 | 96 | 120 | -60 | 50 | |\n| SWRC163 | 520381 | 626103 | 97 | 120 | -60 | 70 | |\n| SWRC164 | 520402 | 626147 | 92 | 120 | -60 | 70 | |\n| SWRC165 | 520374 | 626160 | 92 | 120 | -60 | 100 | |\n| SWRC166 | 520355 | 626174 | 93 | 120 | -55 | 140 | |\n| SWRC167 | 520717 | 626011 | 95 | 120 | -50 | 100 | |\n| SWRC168 | 520655 | 626046 | 101 | 120 | -50 | 100 | |\n| SWRC169 | 520441 | 626176 | 107 | 120 | -55 | 85 | |\n| SWRC170 | 520633 | 626060 | 101 | 120 | -55 | 130 | |\n| ERDD011 | 539579 | 650489 | 165 | 130 | -60 | 179.2 | |\n| ERDD012 | 539818 | 650767 | 211 | 130 | -60 | 79.7 | |\n| ERDD012A | 539823 | 650758 | 212 | 130 | -60 | 260.2 | |\n| ERDD013 | 539765 | 650539 | 161 | 130 | -60 | 81.1 | |\n| ERDD014 | 539860 | 650741 | 216 | 130 | -60 | 182.2 | |\n| ERDD015 | 539729 | 650573 | 163 | 130 | -60 | 158.2 | |\n| ERDD016 | 539878 | 650616 | 197 | 130 | -60 | 102.2 | |\n| ERDD017 | 539848 | 650644 | 203 | 130 | -60 | 102.0 | |\n| ERDD018 | 540021 | 650784 | 193 | 130 | -60 | 152.2 | |\n| ERDD019 | 540284 | 651078 | 127 | 130 | -60 | 173.1 | |\n| ERDD020 | 540466 | 651192 | 178 | 130 | -60 | 158.2 | |\n| ERDD021 | 540551 | 651237 | 186 | 130 | -60 | 224.0 | |\n| ERDD022 | 540356 | 651175 | 159 | 130 | -60 | 185.2 | |\n| ERDD023 | 540304 | 651188 | 113 | 130 | -60 | 152.0 |\nCOVID-19 Protocols\nNewcore\u2019s first priority is the health and safety of all employees, contractors, and local communities.

(\u201cK92\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSX: KNT; OTCQX: KNTNF) is pleased to announce results from the first two surface holes at Kora South and Judd South and from the property-wide airborne geophysics program at the Kainantu gold mine in Papua New Guinea. This is the first time that drilling at Kora South and Judd South had been undertaken from surface by either K92 or prior operators. The results for the latest surface diamond drill holes completed are summarized in Table 1 below.\nKora South and Judd South Drilling Results\nStep-out drilling at both Kora South and Judd South delivered strong results with multiple high-grade and solid thickness intersections in addition to record thickness with the discovery of dilatant zones at both Judd South and Kora South.\nAt Judd South, the results are highlighted by hole KUDD0001, the southernmost step-out hole to date, stepping out 150 metres to the south from the nearest historical surface drill hole. KUDD0001 recorded multiple intersections including 15.25 m at 15.87 g/t AuEq or 13.23 g/t Au, 15 g/t Ag and 1.53% Cu (9.93 m estimated thickness) from the J1 Vein and strong grades from the J2 Vein that recorded 2.90 m at 8.52 g/t AuEq or 5.41 g/t Au, 16 g/t Ag and 1.81% Cu (1.89 m estimated thickness). The hole was terminated early due to loss of hole from drilling before it could reach Kora South.\nImportantly, KUDD0001 discovered for the first time a dilatant zone within the Judd / Judd South vein system, representing the longest intersection to date recorded at Kainantu at 66.55 m at 5.02 g/t AuEq or 3.65 g/t Au, 9 g/t Ag and 0.78% Cu (43.26 m estimated thickness). The dilatant zone is punctuated by higher grades from the J1, J2 and potentially the J3 veins, with continuous gold and copper mineralization between the various veins. Geotechnical conditions observed in the core were also competent and analogous to that of Judd underground.\nAt Kora South, drill hole KUDD0002, the southernmost step-out to date along the Kora-Kora South vein system, stepping out 75 m to the south from the nearest drill hole, recorded solid thickness and high grades from multiple veins including 6.20 m at 17.26 g/t AuEq or 1.62 g/t Au, 151 g/t Ag and 8.56% Cu (4.04 m estimated thickness) from K2 Vein; 0.93 m at 36.39 g/t AuEq or 0.06 g/t Au, 93 g/t Ag and 21.88% Cu (0.60 m estimated thickness) from the K1 Vein; 5.00 m at 7.99 g/t AuEq or 4.67 g/t Au, 47 g/t Ag and 1.70% Cu (3.25 m estimated thickness) from the K3 Vein. A notable feature of the K1 and K2 vein intersections is the very high copper grades, with ~1 metre assay composites up to 21.88% Cu over 0.93 m in K1 and up to 20.40% Cu over 1.04 m in K2, driven by massive copper sulphide veins punctuating the broader vein intersection. Encouragingly the K3 vein recorded one of its thickest intersections to date, despite the hole bottoming while still in K3 mineralization.\nNotably, at Kora South, KUDD0002 intersected a dilatant zone, similar to Judd South, intersecting 35.90 m at 5.98 g/t AuEq or 1.42 g/t Au, 47 g/t Ag and 2.48% Cu (23.34 m estimated thickness), a record in terms of thickness for the Kora-Kora South vein system. The dilatant zone is punctuated by higher grades from the K2 and K3 veins with continuous gold and copper mineralization between the veins. While early days, these dilatant zones represent a potential step-change in terms of the tonnage and metal endowment per vertical metre at Kora South and Judd South. As our drill and surface sampling programs progress its impact will be better understood.\nDrilling results also intersected a previously unknown vein, located approximately 75 m to the east of Judd, recording 3.45 m at 10.36 g/t AuEq or 10.09 g/t Au, 20 g/t Ag and 0.01% Cu (2.24 m estimated thickness). This was the first time drilling had been conducted this far east of Judd and modifications to the drill program to test this vein are underway.\nOther drill results include KUDD0002 recording 0.9 m at 15.43 g/t AuEq or 14.32 g/t Au, 39 g/t Ag and 0.39% (0.59 m estimated thickness) from J1 Vein; and 1.3 m at 16.63 g/t AuEq or 16.60 g/t Au and 0.01% Cu (0.84 m estimated thickness) from J2 Vein, located approximately 80 m north of KUDD0001.\nAdvanced Airborne MobileMT Geophysics Results\nIn November 2021, for the first time in over 10 years, airborne geophysics over the entire ~860 km2 property was flown. The program engaged Expert Geophysics Limited (EGL) to conduct the helicopter-borne MobileMT electromagnetic and magnetic survey. MobileMT is the latest generation of airborne AFMAG technologies, designed in 2017 by the inventor of the ZTEM system. MobileMT measurement frequency range is 25 Hz \u2013 30,000 Hz, while ZTEM range is 25 Hz \u2013 720 Hz, thus delivering a much greater depth range of investigation. Electromagnetic and magnetic data was collected along east-west survey lines, nominally spaced at 200m, and north-south tie lines nominally spaced at 2,000 m.\nThe results from the MobileMT geophysics delivered excellent correlation between known mineral deposits and conductive bodies. In particular, the results demonstrate a potential extensive untested strike length to Kora / Kora South and Judd / Judd South vein systems, beyond the A1 porphyry for several kilometres to the southeast. The results also show a possible confluence of the vein systems between Kora / Kora South and Judd / Judd South with the north-northeast Maniape and Arakompa vein systems, representing a highly prospective target.\nIn addition to the vein targets, known mineralized porphyries were highlighted by geophysics, including A1, Blue Lake, Tankaunan and Timpa.\nCore Photos and Figures\nLong sections of Kora South and Judd South, showing the location of the latest drill holes reported, are provided in figures 1 and 2, respectively. A cross section of KUDD0001 and KUDD0002 are shown in figures 3 and 4, respectively. A core photograph of the K2 Vein from hole KUDD0002 featuring massive copper sulphide mineralization is shown in figure 5 and closeup core samples from KUDD0001 and KUDD0002 are shown in figure 6. A map from the airborne geophysics program proximal to the Kainantu underground mine is shown in figure 7, and a long section illustrating the Highly Conductive Zone from geophysics is in figure 8.\nChris Muller, K92 Vice President Exploration, stated, \u201cDrilling beyond the boundaries of the Mining Lease on Exploration Lease EL470 has confirmed our interpretation that the high-grade Kora and Judd vein systems persist well to the south. The mineralized Kora and Judd trend, implied by newly acquired sub-surface conductivity data from geophysics, will be tested with an expanded drilling campaign during 2022.\u201d\nJohn Lewins, K92 Chief Executive Officer and Director, added, \u201cWhile this may be one of the smallest batches of drill holes we have released, we believe it is one of the most impactful. Since K92 acquired Kainantu in 2015, there has been a great belief in the potential to the South, as we get closer to the A1 porphyry which is interpreted to be the main heat source for the vein systems.\nAs Chris Muller highlighted earlier, mineralization remains intense at both Kora South and Judd South, with solid thickness and high grades. Judd South has been highlighted by 15.25 m at 15.87 g/t AuEq in the J1 Vein from KUDD0001 stepping out ~150 metres to the South from the nearest historical drill hole, and Kora South has been highlighted by 6.20 m at 17.26 g/t AuEq from K2 Vein and 0.93 m at 36.39 g/t AuEq from the K1 Vein both from KUDD0002 stepping out ~75 metres to the South from the nearest drill hole. K1 and K2 also delivered very high copper grades, both punctuated with ~1-2 metre veins of massive copper sulphides grading approximately 20% Cu.\nThe discovery of dilatant zones at both Judd South and Kora South has significant potential in terms of overall endowment and throughput potential, recording 66.55 m at 5.02 g/t AuEq at Judd South and 35.90 m at 5.98 g/t AuEq at Kora South. While it is still early days, we are very pleased that we made the decision to significantly oversize the twin incline that is currently being developed. Based on engineering review, modifications can be made to the conveying system to handle throughputs exceeding 5 million tonnes per annum.\nThe drill results have also highlighted the potential for multiple productive veins beyond K1, K2 and J1. Results at J2 and K3 delivered solid grades and thicknesses and hole KUDD0001 intersected a previously unknown vein approximately 75 m east of Judd South recording 3.45 m at 10.36 g/t AuEq. Prior K92 and historical drilling had not drilled this far east of Judd / Judd South and plans are underway to test this potential vein system.\nThe results from the advanced geophysics program has underscored the significant near-mine and regional exploration potential at Kainantu, including the potential for vein mineralization continuing for kilometers from Kora South and Judd South. We strongly believe we are just scratching the surface in both our vein and porphyry exploration programs.\u201d\nTable 1 - Significant Intercepts from Kora South and Judd South Diamond Drilling\n|

metres to generally 1 metre. The drill core is sawn half core cut along a reference line, with the remainder of the core returned to the core tray. Core samples are then placed in numbered calico and plastic bags, with a numbered sample ticket for dispatch to the assay laboratory. Samples are separately assayed for gold, copper and silver. K92\u2019s procedure includes the insertion standards, blanks and duplicates. Gold assays are by the fire assay method. Copper and silver assays are by three-acid-digestion method (nitric, perchloric & hydrochloric mix).\nK92 maintains an industry-standard analytical quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) and data verification program to monitor laboratory performance and ensure high quality assays. Results from this program confirm reliability of the assay results. All sampling and analytical work for the mine exploration program is performed by Intertek Testing Services (PNG) LTD, an independent accredited laboratory that is located on site. External check assays for QA/QC purposes are performed at SGS Australia Pty Ltd in Townsville, Queensland, Australia.\nK92 Vice President Exploration, Mr. Chris Muller, PGeo, and Andrew Kohler, PGeo, Mine Geology Manager and Mine Exploration Manager for K92, both Qualified Persons under the meaning of National Instrument 43-101 \u2013 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, have reviewed and are responsible for the technical content of this news release. In addition to the analytical QA/QC program outlined above, data verification also includes significant time onsite reviewing drill core, soil and outcrop sampling, artisanal workings, as well as discussing work programs and results with geology personnel and external consultants.\nAbout K92\nK92 Mining Inc. is engaged in the production of gold, copper and silver from the Kora and Judd deposits at the Kainantu Gold Mine in the Eastern Highlands province of Papua New Guinea, as well as exploration and development of mineral deposits in the immediate vicinity of the mine. The Company declared commercial production from Kainantu in February 2018 and is in a strong financial position.\nThe Company commenced an expansion of the mine based on an updated Preliminary Economic Assessment on the property which was published in January 2019 and updated in July 2020.

The Lamaque Project is comprised of three separate but contiguous properties: Lamaque South (containing the Upper Triangle zones, Lower Triangle zones, and the deposits of Parallel and Ormaque), Sigma-Lamaque and Aumaque (see Figures 1 and 2). The Upper Triangle zones within Lamaque South are currently being mined with access by surface ramp. The Study includes an update to the current operation, updated economics on the Upper Triangle zones (zones C1 through C5), as well as preliminary economic assessments on the inferred resources in the Lower Triangle zones (zones C6 through C10) and the Ormaque deposit.\nKey Highlights\n-\nBase case economics using a gold price assumption of $1,500 per ounce:\n-\nUpper Triangle Reserves NPV5%1 of $459 million\n-\nLower Triangle Inferred Resource NPV5% of $162 million and IRR2,3 of 33%\n-\nOrmaque Inferred Resources NPV5% of $197 million and IRR 39%2,4\n-\n-\nUpside economics using spot gold price assumption of $1,900 per ounce:\n-\nUpper Triangle Reserves NPV5% of $673 million\n-\nLower Triangle Inferred Resource NPV5% of $295 million and IRR of 48%\n-\nOrmaque Inferred Resources NPV5% of $285 million and IRR 45%\n-\n-\nKey growth opportunities: High-grade inferred resources (Lower Triangle zones and Ormaque deposit) provide potential for significant production increases and opportunities for resource expansion. Based on successful conversion of inferred resources at Lower Triangle and Ormaque, mining would commence in these areas in 2026. With multiple concurrent centers of production, this represents a de-risked approach to extending the production profile at Lamaque.\n-\nIncreased gold production to over 190,000 ounces per year based on the Upper Triangle reserves; and sustaining over 180,000 ounces per year with production from Lower Triangle Inferred and Ormaque inferred resources.\n-\nExtended mine life with ~5.5 years of production from Upper Triangle reserves, and potential for an additional ~8.5 years of mine life from Lower Triangle and Ormaque inferred resources.\n-\nWell-positioned in the prolific Abitibi Greenstone Belt: In 2021, Eldorado expanded its land position by over 500% with the acquisition of QMX Gold (referred to as the Bourlamaque property), which is in close proximity to the Lamaque Project.\n-\nReadily equipped: Robust surface infrastructure is already in place at the Triangle mine. To support current operations and continue mining the Upper Triangle Reserves, additional infrastructure is required on the Sigma tailings, and the mine dewatering systems.\n-\nPermitting advancing and in compliance: The Lamaque Project is fully permitted under Federal and Provincial regulations. The project is in compliance regarding environmental quality and is regularly assessed by Provincial authorities in accordance with the Environmental Quality Act (\u201cEQA\u201d) of Quebec. Discussions with Provincial Ministries about making changes to the existing permits have commenced with Provincial Ministries and are expected to be a normal course.\n-\nStrong collaboration and support from the Val-d\u2019Or communities and a transparent and predictable regulatory environment makes Quebec a world-class mining jurisdiction.\n1 After-tax net present value at a discount rate of 5%. 2 After-tax internal rate of return. 3 NPV and IRR for Lower Triangle is calculated on the differential after-tax cash flow between the Lower Triangle + Upper Triangle (B) and the standalone Upper Triangle case (A). 4 NPV and IRR for Ormaque is calculated on the differential after-tax cash flow between the Ormaque + Lower Triangle + Upper Triangle (C) and (B).\n\u201cThe Lamaque Project has been an outstanding acquisition for Eldorado Gold,\u201d said George Burns, Eldorado\u2019s President and CEO. \u201cWe acquired the asset for approximately $360 million in 2017, published a PFS in 2018, and reached commercial production 12-months later. Since then, we have demonstrated a track record of success by replacing reserves year-over-year and exceeding peak production levels beyond the 2018 Pre-Feasibility Study. Additionally, we have more than doubled the inferred resource base since the acquisition. The results of the Technical Study showcase the growing value of Lamaque and the significant upside potential from the Lower Triangle zones and Ormaque deposit.\u201d\n\u201cWith the Triangle-Sigma decline project now complete, we are focused on an exploration drift and resource conversion at Ormaque,\u201d adds Burns. \u201cOur 2022 exploration strategy is also focused on resource expansion at Ormaque and in the Upper and Lower Triangle zones and testing new targets within our expanded license area to support continued growth at Lamaque. Furthermore, our strategic positioning in the Abitibi region gives us additional exposure to the potential upside in the resource-rich area. We have a safe, successful track record of project execution and project delivery, which is a testament to our team. We are fortunate to have a dedicated and experienced workforce whose commitment to project delivery has been unwavering. Our strategic position in the region and our strong, collaborative local relationships will allow us to continue to drive sustainable, long-term benefits for the community in Val-d\u2019Or, and continue to deliver value for our shareholders.\u201d\nTechnical Study Highlights1\nAs outlined in the table below, results from the Technical Study present the mining of three separate zones:\n-\nFeasibility-level update to the current operation centered on the Mineral Reserves in the Upper Triangle zones and Parallel deposit;\n-\nPreliminary economic assessment (\u201cPEA\u201d) of Inferred Resources from the Lower Triangle zones; and\n-\nPEA of Inferred Resources from the Ormaque deposit.\n| 2022 Technical Study | |||\n| Reserves Case | Preliminary Economic Assessments1 | ||\n| Upper Triangle | Lower Triangle Inferred Resources Case | Ormaque Inferred Resources Case | |\n| Production | |||\n| Life of Mine (LOM) | ~5.5 years | ~4.5 years potential LOM extension | ~3.5 years |\n| Average Annual Gold Production over LOM (oz) | 187,000 | 180,000 | 181,000 |\n| Average Annual Mill Feed (ktpa) | 825 | 846 | 872 |\n| Incremental | Incremental | ||\n| Average Gold Grade (g/t) | 7.3 | 6.4 | 6.9 |\n| Recovery (%) | 96.5 | 95.0 | 96.5 |\n| Operating Costs3 | Incremental | Incremental | |\n| Annual Average Cost ($M) | 111.9 | 113.3 | 122.6 |\n| Average cost ($/tonne ore) | 136 | 129 | 143 |\n| Average cost ($/oz Au) | 597 | 656 | 670 |\n| Capital Costs | Incremental | Incremental | |\n| Growth Capital ($M) | 70 | 86 | 20 |\n| Sustaining Capital ($M) | 230 | 239 | 88 |\n| Total Capital ($M) | 300 | 325 | 108 |\n| Economic Analysis | Incremental | Incremental | |\n| NPV @ 5% discount rate ($M) | 459 | 162 | 197 |\n| IRR (%) | n.a.2 | 33 | 39 |\n| Gold price assumption ($/oz) | 1,500 | 1,500 | 1,500 |\n1 The Inferred Resources Cases are PEAs. As the PEAs supporting the Ormaque Inferred Resources and the Lower Triangle Inferred Resources consider the potential economic viability of developing the separate satellite deposit that comprises the Ormaque Inferred Resources and the separate zones that comprise the Lower Triangle Inferred Resources in conjunction with the main zones of the Upper Triangle Reserves development project, these PEAs will not impact the results of the economic/financial assessment of the Upper Triangle Reserves.\n2 The project\u2019s cashflow remains positive in each year, as such there is no calculated internal rate of return or payback period. Capital expenditures are part of ongoing operational development and are funded by ongoing gold sales and there are no external funding requirements.\n3 These measures are non-IFRS measures. See the section \u2018Non-IFRS Measures\u2019 at the end of this press release and in Eldorado\u2019s December 31, 2020 MD&A for explanations and discussion of these non-IFRS measures.\nThe PEAs of Inferred Resources from the Lower Triangle zones and the Ormaque deposit are distinct from and do not affect the feasibility-level update to the current operations on the Mineral Reserves in the Upper Triangle zones and Parallel deposit.\nReview of Operations\nEldorado owns the Lamaque Project in Quebec, Canada through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Eldorado Gold Qu\u00e9bec. The deposits at Lamaque are currently, and will continue to be, mined by underground methods. In 2022, over 815,000 tonnes of ore at an average gold grade of 6.75 grams per tonne are expected to be mined and processed from the Upper Triangle zones. 2022 cash operating costs per ounce1 of $620 to $670 reflect increased mining and processing costs due to higher throughput and cost inflation.\n1 Cash operating costs per ounce is a non-IFRS measure. Certain additional disclosures for non-IFRS measures have been incorporated by reference and additional detail can be found at the end of this press release and in the section \u2018Non-IFRS Measures\u2019 of Eldorado\u2019s December 31, 2020 MD&A.\nProperty Description\nThe Lamaque Project is situated near the city of Val-d\u2019Or in the province of Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, approximately 550 km northwest of Montr\u00e9al. Val-d\u2019Or has been a highly active mining area for a century, with significant mineral deposits found throughout the region. Gold has been produced from the historic Sigma and Lamaque mines starting in the early 1930s. More recently, Eldorado acquired the Lamaque Project through the purchase of Integra Gold Corp in 2017. Eldorado achieved commercial production on March 31, 2019, from ore mined at the Upper Triangle zones and processed at the refurbished Sigma mill.\nSince the acquisition of Integra Gold Corp. by Eldorado in 2017, significant exploration activities have been conducted at both Upper Triangle and Lower Triangle zones as well as other deposits and targets including Plug #4, Parallel, Aumaque, South Gabbro, Lamaque Deep, Vein #6, P5 Gap, Sigma East Extension and Sector Nord. In January 2020, Eldorado announced the discovery of the Ormaque deposit. Eldorado continues to explore the Lamaque property and adjacent Bourlamaque property extensively.\nFigure 1: Location of the Lamaque Project with respect to the City of Val-d\u2019Or is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/cbd0be36-99ca-41d3-867f-f91cc20f8f74\nFigure 2: Long-section of the Lamaque Project is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/2e4c57ef-bac8-48b2-95e2-397af96acd15\nReview of Economic Analysis1\nThe Upper Triangle Reserves NPV5% of $459 million, based on $1,500 per ounce gold, has increased significantly over the 2018 Pre-Feasibility Study (\u201cPFS\u201d). The Upper Triangle Reserves feasibility-level economic analysis includes Reserves from the Parallel deposit.\nSeparately, the PEA for the Lower Triangle Inferred Resource, based on $1,500 per ounce gold, supports an additional NPV5% of $162 million.\nSeparately, the PEA for the Ormaque Inferred Resource, based on $1,500 per ounce gold, indicates an additional NPV5% of $197 million.\nThe economic models were subjected to sensitivity analyses to determine the effects of changing metal prices, capital, and operating expenditures on financial returns. This analysis showed that the project economics are robust and are most sensitive to metal prices.\nReserve Case and Inferred Resource Cases After-Tax NPV(5%) and IRR Sensitivity\n| Sensitivity Table \u2013 Gold Price | |||||\n| Reserves Case | Inferred Resources Case | ||||\n| Upper Triangle | Lower Triangle | Ormaque | |||\n| Gold Price | After-Tax NPV ($M) | After Tax NPV ($M) | IRR | After Tax NPV ($M) | IRR |\n| $1,300 | 318 | 81 | 21 | 137 | 31 |\n| $1,500 (base case) | 459 | 162 | 33 | 197 | 39 |\n| $1,900 (spot) | 673 | 295 | 48 | 285 | 45 |\n| $2,000 | 722 | 328 | 51 | 307 | 47 |\nThe PEAs supporting the Lower Triangle Inferred Resource and the Ormaque Inferred Resource, consider the potential economic viability of developing the separate zones that comprise the Lower Triangle Inferred Resource and the separate satellite deposit that comprises the Ormaque Inferred Resource in conjunction with the main zones of the Upper Triangle Reserves development project.\n1 See \u201cNotes on Lower Triangle Inferred and Ormaque Inferred PEAs\u201d below.\nCapital Costs\nAs outlined in the table below, the initial growth capital required for both the reserves and inferred cases is modest.\n| Preliminary Economic Assessments | |||\n| Reserves Case | Inferred Resources Case | ||\n| Upper Triangle | Lower Triangle | Ormaque | |\n| Growth Capital ($M) | 70 | 86 | 20 |\n| Sustaining Capital ($M) | 226 | 243 | 88 |\n| Total Capital ($M) | 296 | 329 | 108 |\nOperating Costs1\nThe table below provides the operating costs for the Upper Triangle Reserves Case and the Lower Triangle Inferred Case and the Ormaque Inferred Case. The operating costs estimate for the Upper Triangle Reserves Case average $136 per tonne ore, the incremental Lower Triangle Inferred Resources Case average $129 per tonne mineralized material, and the incremental Ormaque Inferred Case averages $143 per tonne ore. The operating cost estimates include mining, processing, and general and administrative costs.\n| Preliminary Economic Assessments | |||\n| Reserves Case | Inferred Resources Case | ||\n| Upper Triangle | Lower Triangle | Ormaque | |\n| Annual Average Cost ($M) | 112 | 113 | 123 |\n| Average cost ($/tonne ore) | 136 | 129 | 143 |\n| Average cost ($/oz Au) | 597 | 656 | 670 |\n| All-in Sustaining Cost | 829 | 979 | 819 |\n1 These measures are non-IFRS measures. See the section \u2018Non-IFRS Measures\u2019 at the end of this press release and in Eldorado\u2019s December 31, 2020 MD&A for explanations and discussion of these non-IFRS measures.\nOptimization and Future Opportunity\nAs part of an overall growth strategy in the Abitibi area, Eldorado continues to evaluate exploration and development opportunities for high-grade ore that could be mined and trucked to the Sigma mill as well as bulk mining opportunities that would entail upgrading the Sigma mill to its permitted capacity of 5,000 tonnes per day.\nAnother area for opportunity highlighted in the Technical Study was the use of alternate materials handling technologies for the Lower Triangle zones. Materials handling trade-off studies at a PEA level indicate a potential for reducing costs, reducing equipment and ventilation requirements, while at the same time reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Further studies will be carried out to increase the level of confidence in the costs and benefits of technologies evaluated, which include vertical conveyors, conventional conveying, or the use of battery electric vehicle trucks.\nGeology and Mineralization\nThere are three deposits: i) Triangle, consisting of zones C1 through C5 in Upper Triangle, and C6 through C10 in Lower Triangle, ii) Parallel and iii) Ormaque. Gold mineralization in the Triangle, Parallel and Ormaque deposits occurs primarily within quartz-tourmaline-carbonate-pyrite shear and extension veins. At Triangle, most of the deposit is contained within a series of shear veins (C1-C10) emplaced along steeply south-dipping reverse shear zones. The ore zones are localized where the shear zones cut across the subvertical Triangle Plug, but extend into the adjacent mafic lapilli-blocks tuffs as well.\nThe Parallel and Ormaque deposits are located two kilometers northwest of the Triangle mine portal, adjacent to the Triangle-Sigma decline. Mineralized veins in both are hosted within fine- to medium-grained C-porphyry diorite. Ormaque is dominated by gently south-dipping extension veins and minor breccia zones, localized adjacent to sub-vertical shear zones. At Parallel, mineralized zones consist of gently-dipping extension veins in the upper part of the deposit and more steeply-dipping shear-hosted veins at deeper levels.\nInfrastructure\nThrough its existing infrastructure, the Lamaque Project is readily equipped to support all planned operations. The Triangle mine site infrastructure includes offices, dry storage, truck shop, warehouse, ventilation facilities, waste rock stockpile, slurry plant, cement silo, and fuel station. The Sigma Mill site includes a processing plant, covered ore storage, crushing facility and a warehouse. Support infrastructure also includes administration, construction, and exploration offices, as well as a core yard.\nThe site has its own water management and collection ponds. The existing power line connecting the Sigma Mill to the Triangle mine is designed to accommodate current as well as foreseeable future operations.\nEnvironment and Permitting\nThe Triangle mine at the Lamaque Project is an operating mine and is fully permitted under Federal and Provincial regulations. The asset is in compliance regarding environmental quality and is regularly assessed by Provincial authorities regarding EQA of Qu\u00e9bec. Mineralized material in Lower Triangle is fully permitted under existing certificates of authorizations (\u201cCoA\u201d).\nThere is an existing CoA for mining in the Ormaque deposit, but this will require an amendment to allow for mining below a depth of 453 meters. There are no indications that the project will be unsuccessful in obtaining a permit amendment.\nReclamation costs for the Lamaque Project were evaluated at $10 million based on recent assessments and a full review of the closure plan is scheduled in 2023.\nMineral Resources Estimate\nThe table below provides the Mineral Resource Estimate for the Lamaque Project as of September 30, 2021. The Mineral Resources were classified using logic consistent with the CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves referred to in National Instrument 43-101. The mineralization of the project satisfies sufficient criteria to be classified into measured, indicated, and inferred mineral resource categories.\nMineral Resources, as of September 30, 20211\n| Deposit/Zone | Categories | Tonnes | Grade Au | Contained Au |\n| Upper Triangle | Measured | 876 | 9.49 | 267 |\n| Indicated | 5,316 | 8.51 | 1,453 | |\n| Measured + Indicated | 6,191 | 8.65 | 1,721 | |\n| Inferred | 1,792 | 6.63 | 382 | |\n| Lower Triangle | Inferred | 6,408 | 6.89 | 1,420 |\n| Parallel | Indicated | 221 | 9.87 | 70.2 |\n| Inferred | 200 | 8.83 | 56.7 | |\n| Ormaque2 | Inferred | 2,223 | 11.74 | 839 |\n1 See \u201cNotes on Mineral Resources\u201d below.\n2 Ormaque Inferred Resources as of December 31, 2021\nNotes on Mineral Resources\nMineral Resources and Mineral Reserves are as of September 30, 2021, unless otherwise stated.\n-\nMineral Resource Reporting and demonstration of Reasonable Prospects for Eventual Economic Extraction:\nThe Mineral Resources used a long term look gold metal price of $1,800/oz for the determination of resource cut-off grades or values. This guided execution of the next step where constraining surfaces or volumes were created to control resource reporting. Underground Resources were constrained by 3D volumes whose design was guided by the reporting cut-off grade or value, contiguous areas of mineralization and mineability. Only material internal to these volumes were eligible for reporting. -\nCut-off Grades\nLamaque: 3.0 g/t Au; Ormaque: 3.5 g/t Au\nTriangle Deposit\nThe Mineral Resource estimates for the Upper Triangle zones and the Lower Triangle zones of the Triangle deposit used data from both surface and underground diamond drillholes. The resource estimates were made from 3D block models created by utilizing commercial geological modelling and mine planning software. The block model cell size is 5 meters east by 5 meters north by 5 meters high. The mineral resources are reported within the constraining mineralized domain volumes that were created to control resource reporting and at a 3.0 grams per tonne (\u201cg/t\u201d) gold cut-off grade.\nParallel Deposit\nThe Mineral Resource estimate for the Parallel deposit used data from surface diamond drillholes. The resource estimates were made from 3D block models created by utilizing commercial geological modelling and mine planning software. The block model cell size is 5 meters east by 5 meters north by 5 meters high. The block model was not rotated. The mineral resources are reported within the constraining domain volumes that were created to control resource reporting and at a 3.0 g/t gold cut-off grade.\nOrmaque Deposit\nThe Mineral Resource estimate for the Ormaque deposit used data from surface diamond drillholes. The resource estimates were made from 3D block models created by utilizing commercial geological modelling and mine planning software. The block model cell size is 5 meters east by 5 meters north by 5 meters high. The mineral resources are reported within the constraining volumes that were created to control resource reporting at a 3.5 g/t gold cut-off grade.\nMineral Reserve Estimate\nThe Mineral Reserve estimate is based on Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources for the Upper Triangle zones and Parallel deposit. Mineral Reserves are reported using a gold price of $1,300 per ounce and an exchange rate of 1.25 CAN$/US$. A cut-off grade of 4.38 g/t after dilution was applied at stope scale for discrimination of material to be retained in reserves and all stopes falling below cut-off were taken out of the mine plan. All Mineral Reserves are classified as Proven or Probable in accordance with the 2019 CIM Estimation of Mineral Resources & Mineral Reserves Best Practices Guidelines.\nLamaque Project Mineral Reserves as of September 30th, 20211\n| Reserves | Proven | Probable | Total P&P | |||||||||\n| Zone | Tonnes | Grade | Ounces | Tonnes | Grade | Ounces | Tonnes | Grade | Ounces | % | ||\n| Upper Triangle zones | C1 | 40,867 | 4.96 | 6,516 | 120,884 | 6.38 | 24,810 | 161,751 | 6.02 | 31,326 | 2.9 | % |\n| C2 | 169,993 | 6.01 | 32,831 | 151,579 | 6.32 | 30,782 | 321,572 | 6.15 | 63,613 | 5.8 | % | |\n| C3 | 1,006 | 8.88 | 287 | 187,668 | 6.34 | 38,242 | 188,674 | 6.35 | 38,529 | 3.5 | % | |\n| C4 | 266,554 | 9.97 | 85,484 | 2,666,048 | 6.92 | 593,496 | 2,932,602 | 7.20 | 678,980 | 62.2 | % | |\n| C5 | 0 | 0.00 | 0 | 758,984 | 9.10 | 222,083 | 758,984 | 9.10 | 222,083 | 20.4 | % | |\n| Parallel | 0 | 0.00 | 0 | 269,005 | 6.08 | 52,588 | 269,005 | 6.08 | 52,588 | 4.8 | % | |\n| Surface Inventory | 23,227 | 5.60 | 4,182 | 0 | 0.00 | 0 | 23,227 | 5.60 | 4,182 | 0.4 | % | |\n| Total | 501,647 | 8.02 | 129,300 | 4,154,167 | 7.20 | 962,002 | 4,655,814 | 7.29 | 1,091,302 | 100 | % | |\n| Total recovered (96%) | 124,128 | 923,522 | 1,047,649 | |||||||||\n| *Note: Tonnes and grade are diluted and consider mining recovery.

This included an appropriate Quality Control sampling program of reference standards, blanks and duplicates to monitor the integrity of all assay results.\nNotes on Lower Triangle Inferred and Ormaque Inferred PEAs\nReaders should take care to differentiate these PEAs from the economic analysis for the Upper Triangle Reserves. The PEAs only demonstrate the potential viability of mineral resources and are not as comprehensive as the economic analysis for the Upper Triangle Reserves. The level of detail, precision and confidence in outcomes between the economic analysis for the Upper Triangle Reserves and the PEAs is significantly different.\nThe PEAs are preliminary in nature and are based on numerous assumptions and the incorporation of Inferred mineral resources. Inferred mineral resources are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves except as allowed for by National Instrument 43-101 in PEA studies. There is no guarantee that Inferred mineral resources can be converted to Indicated or Measured mineral resources and, as such, there is no guarantee that the economics described herein will be achieved. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.\nNon-IFRS Measures\nCertain non-IFRS ratios are included in this press release, including average realized gold price per ounce sold, cash operating costs per ounce sold, total cash costs per ounce sold, all-in sustaining costs (\"AISC\") per ounce sold and adjusted net earnings/(loss) per share. Certain non-IFRS financial measures are included in this presentation, or are used to derive the above-noted non-IFRS ratios, including cash operating costs (C1), total cash costs (C2), AISC, adjusted net earnings/(loss), cash flow from operations before changes in non-cash working capital, earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\"), free cash flow and sustaining capital.\nThe Company believes that these non-IFRS measures, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\u201cIFRS\u201d), provide investors an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the Company. The non-IFRS measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. These measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS, and therefore may not be comparable to other issuers. Certain additional disclosures for these non-IFRS measures have been incorporated by reference and can be found in the section \u2018Non-IFRS Measures\u2019 in the December 31, 2020 MD&A available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and on the Company\u2019s website under the \u2018Investors\u2019 section.

The reader is directed to carefully review the detailed risk discussion in our most recent Annual Information Form filed on SEDAR and EDGAR under our Company name, which discussion is incorporated by reference in this release, for a fuller understanding of the risks and uncertainties that affect the Company\u2019s business and operations.\nForward-looking statements and information is designed to help you understand management\u2019s current views of our near and longer term prospects, and it may not be appropriate for other purposes.\nThere can be no assurance that forward-looking statements or information will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements or information contained herein. Except as required by law, we do not expect to update forward-looking statements and information continually as conditions change and you are referred to the full discussion of the Company's business contained in the Company's reports filed with the securities regulatory authorities in Canada and the United States.\nFinancial Information and condensed statements contained herein or attached hereto may not be suitable for readers that are unfamiliar with the Company and is not a substitute for reading the Company\u2019s financial statements and related MD&A available on our website and on SEDAR under our Company name.

        "full_text": "Mandalay Resources Corporation Announces Record Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2021\nTORONTO, Feb. 24, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mandalay Resources Corporation (\"Mandalay\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: MND, OTCQB: MNDJF) is pleased to announce its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe Company\u2019s audited consolidated financial results for the year ended December 31, 2021, together with its Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis (\u201cMD&A\u201d) for the corresponding period, can be accessed under the Company\u2019s profile on www.sedar.com and on the Company\u2019s website at www.mandalayresources.com. All currency references in this press release are in U.S. dollars except as otherwise indicated.\nFourth Quarter 2021 Highlights:\n-\nConsolidated quarterly revenue of $72.9 million, highest ever quarterly result;\n-\nAdjusted EBITDA1 of $40.6 million, highest ever quarterly result; and\n-\nConsolidated net income of $15.3 million ($0.17 or C$0.21 per share).\nFull-Year 2021 Highlights:\n-\nRecord revenue of $229.4 million;\n-\nRecord adjusted EBITDA1 of $115.0 million;\n-\nConsolidated net income of $54.9 million ($0.60 or C$0.75 per share);\n-\n$18.2 million in free cash flow1 and $62.0 million in net cash flows from operating activities; and\n-\n$30.7 million in cash on hand at the end of December 2021, $47.2 million in cash on hand at the end of the January 2022.\nDominic Duffy, President and CEO of Mandalay, commented:\n\u201cMandalay\u2019s strong results this quarter and for the full-year 2021 provides further evidence of the successful execution of our strategy. We achieved significant financial milestones in 2021 including a 28% year-over-year growth in revenue for a record $229.4 million by year-end, resulting in over $18 million in free cash flow. The Company is now in an excellent financial position with a strong balance sheet, and I would like to thank all of our employees and contractors for their continued commitment in making Mandalay a leading junior gold producer.\n\u201cThe main driver behind this is Costerfield\u2019s continued operational strength, making it a lynchpin to Mandalay\u2019s success today and going forward given its growing Mineral Reserves and Resources as indicated in our February 16, 2022, press release. Costerfield generated $33.0 million in quarterly adjusted EBITDA1 and $17.8 million in net income, bringing the site\u2019s year-end totals to $88.9 million and $47.8 million, respectively. While at Bj\u00f6rkdal, its continued production improvements over the second half of the year sets the operation up for a much-improved 2022, while also investing in what is proving up to be a very successful exploration program. The site generated $85.3 million, $27.9 million and $4.9 million in revenue, adjusted EBITDA1 and net income, respectively, in 2021.\n\u201cIn 2021, the Company also generated a consolidated $115.0 million in adjusted EBITDA1 for a margin of 50% \u2013 another Company record. We earned $22.0 million (C$0.30 per share) in adjusted net income and $15.3 million (C$0.21 per share) in net income during the fourth quarter, marking our eighth consecutive quarter of profitability. For the full-year, the Company generated $49.2 million (C$0.67 per share) in consolidated adjusted net income and $54.9 million (C$0.75 per share) in net income.\n\u201cMandalay ended 2021 with a cash balance of $30.7 million, a slight increase as compared to the third quarter of 2021, however, this does not consider approximately $15 million in cash normally scheduled to be received in December but was pushed into January 2022 due to the ongoing global logistic challenges. As a result, at the end of January 2022, Mandalay had a cash balance of $47.2 million. Moreover, during the first half of 2022, Mandalay anticipates the release of a minimum of C$3.0 million as part-compensation for worked finalized at Lupin during 2021. During 2021, the Company repaid $15.1 million towards its Syndicated Facility, leaving $43.9 million owing.\n\u201cOur consolidated cash cost for 2021 was $873 per saleable gold equivalent ounce produced; a 4% increase compared to the $843 for full-year 2020. This increase was mainly associated with the startup costs of the processing facility at Cerro Bayo and the higher operating expenses at Bj\u00f6rkdal. While our all-in sustaining cost per saleable gold equivalent ounce produced declined 3% year-over-year to $1,212.\n\u201c2021 was a statement year for Mandalay, we\u2019ve now demonstrated 24 months of operational execution and look to carry this momentum throughout 2022 by obtaining higher production numbers and better cash flows, which ultimately should lead to better shareholder returns.\u201d\n____________________________\n1 Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are not standardized financial measures under IFRS and might not be comparable to similar financial measures disclosed by other issuers.

The Company is focused on growing its production and reducing costs to generate significant positive cashflow. Mandalay is committed to operating safely and in an environmentally responsible manner, while developing a high level of community and employee engagement.\nMandalay\u2019s mission is to create shareholder value through the profitable operation and continuing the regional exploration program, at both its Costerfield and Bj\u00f6rkdal mines. Currently, the Company\u2019s main objectives are to continue mining the high-grade Youle vein at Costerfield, bring online the deeper Shepherd veins, both of which will continue to supply high-grade ore to the processing plant, and to extend Youle Mineral Reserves. At Bj\u00f6rkdal, the Company will aim to increase production from the Aurora zone and other higher-grade areas in the coming years, in order to maximize profit margins from the mine.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis news release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including statements regarding the Company\u2019s anticipated performance in 2021. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Actual results and developments may differ materially from those contemplated by these statements depending on, among other things, changes in commodity prices and general market and economic conditions. The factors identified above are not intended to represent a complete list of the factors that could affect Mandalay. A description of additional risks that could result in actual results and developments differing from those contemplated by forward-looking statements in this news release can be found under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Mandalay\u2019s annual information form dated March 31, 2021, a copy of which is available under Mandalay\u2019s profile at www.sedar.com. In addition, there can be no assurance that any inferred resources that are discovered as a result of additional drilling will ever be upgraded to proven or probable reserves. Although Mandalay has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.\nNon-IFRS Measures\nThis news release may contain references to adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, free cash flow, cash cost per saleable ounce of gold equivalent produced and all-in sustaining cost all of which are non-IFRS measures and do not have standardized meanings under IFRS. Therefore, these measures may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.\nManagement uses adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow as measures of operating performance to assist in assessing the Company\u2019s ability to generate liquidity through operating cash flow to fund future working capital needs and to fund future capital expenditures, as well as to assist in comparing financial performance from period to period on a consistent basis. Management uses adjusted net income in order to facilitate an understanding of the Company\u2019s financial performance prior to the impact of non-recurring or special items. The Company believes that these measures are used by and are useful to investors and other users of the Company\u2019s financial statements in evaluating the Company\u2019s operating and cash performance because they allow for analysis of its financial results without regard to special, non-cash and other non-core items, which can vary substantially from company to company and over different periods.\nThe Company defines adjusted EBITDA as income from mine operations, net of administration costs, and before interest, taxes, non-cash charges/(income), intercompany charges and finance costs. The Company defines adjusted net income as net income before special items. Special items are items of income and expense that are presented separately due to their nature and, in some cases, expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them. A reconciliation between adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income, on the one hand, and consolidated net income, on the other hand, is included in the MD&A.\nThe Company defines free cash flow as a measure of the Corporation\u2019s ability to generate and manage liquidity. It is calculated starting with the net cash flows from operating activities (as per IFRS) and then subtracting capital expenditures and lease payments. Refer to Section 1.2 of MD&A for a reconciliation between free cash flow and net cash flows from operating activities.\nFor Costerfield, saleable equivalent gold ounces produced is calculated by adding to saleable gold ounces produced, the saleable antimony tonnes produced times the average antimony price in the period divided by the average gold price in the period. The total cash operating cost associated with the production of these saleable equivalent ounces produced in the period is then divided by the saleable equivalent gold ounces produced to yield the cash cost per saleable equivalent ounce produced. The cash cost excludes royalty expenses. Site all-in sustaining costs include total cash operating costs, sustaining mining capital, royalty expense, accretion and depletion. Sustaining capital reflects the capital required to maintain each site\u2019s current level of operations. The site\u2019s all-in sustaining cost per ounce of saleable gold equivalent in a period equals the all-in sustaining cost divided by the saleable equivalent gold ounces produced in the period.\nFor Cerro Bayo, saleable equivalent gold ounces produced is calculated by adding to saleable gold ounces produced, the saleable silver ounces produced times the average silver price in the period divided by the average gold price in the period. The total cash operating cost associated with the production of these saleable equivalent ounces produced in the period is then divided by the saleable equivalent gold ounces produced to yield the cash cost per saleable equivalent ounce produced. The cash cost excludes royalty expenses. Site all-in sustaining costs include total cash operating costs, sustaining mining capital, royalty expense, accretion and depletion. Sustaining capital reflects the capital required to maintain each site\u2019s current level of operations. The site\u2019s all-in sustaining cost per ounce of saleable gold equivalent in a period equals the all-in sustaining cost divided by the saleable equivalent gold ounces produced in the period.\nFor Bj\u00f6rkdal, the total cash operating cost associated with the production of saleable gold ounces produced in the period is then divided by the saleable gold ounces produced to yield the cash cost per saleable gold ounce produced. The cash cost excludes royalty expenses. Site all-in costs include total cash operating costs, royalty expense, accretion, depletion, depreciation and amortization. Site all-in sustaining costs include total cash operating costs, sustaining mining capital, royalty expense, accretion and depletion. Sustaining capital reflects the capital required to maintain each site\u2019s current level of operations. The site\u2019s all-in sustaining cost per ounce of saleable gold equivalent in a period equals the all-in sustaining cost divided by the saleable equivalent gold ounces produced in the period.\nFor the Company as a whole, cash cost per saleable gold equivalent ounce is calculated by summing the gold equivalent ounces produced by each site and dividing the total by the sum of cash operating costs at the sites. Consolidated cash cost excludes royalty and corporate level general and administrative expenses. This definition was updated in the third quarter of 2020 to exclude corporate general and administrative expenses to better align with industry standard. All-in sustaining cost per saleable ounce gold equivalent in the period equals the sum of cash costs associated with the production of gold equivalent ounces at all operating sites in the period plus corporate overhead expense in the period plus sustaining mining capital, royalty expense, accretion, depletion, depreciation and amortization, divided by the total saleable gold equivalent ounces produced in the period. A reconciliation between cost of sales and cash costs, and also cash cost to all-in sustaining costs are included in the MD&A.\nFor Further Information:\nDominic Duffy\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nEdison Nguyen\nManager, Analytics and Investor Relations\nContact:\n(647) 260-1566 ext. 1",

Centerra added ounces to the Mount Milligan Mine\u2019s mineral resources as a result of in-fill drilling completed during the 2021 drilling program.\n-\nCenterra\u2019s proven and probable copper mineral reserves decreased by 101 million pounds to 1,366 million pounds of contained copper (257 Mt at 0.24% copper), primarily as a result of 2021 depletion.\n-\nCenterra\u2019s measured and indicated copper mineral resources, exclusive of mineral reserves, increased by 453 million pounds to 5,783 million pounds of contained copper (1,032 Mt at 0.20% copper).\nCenterra Year-End Gold Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources\nMineral Reserves\nAs at December 31, 2021, Centerra\u2019s proven and probable gold mineral reserves total an estimated 4.85 million contained ounces (288 Mt at 0.52 g/t gold), compared to 11.2 million contained ounces (374.6 Mt at 0.93 g/t gold) in the prior year. In 2021, proven and probable gold mineral reserves decreased by 6.3 million contained ounces, primarily due to processing of approximately 0.5 million contained ounces and the loss of control of the Kumtor Mine (including the gold inventory of approximately 6.0 million contained ounces as of December 31, 2020). Partially offsetting the overall decrease was the addition of approximately 0.2 million contained ounces at the \u00d6ks\u00fct Mine.\nMount Milligan\nAt the Mount Milligan Mine, proven and probable gold mineral reserves total an estimated 1.8 million ounces of contained gold (150.0 Mt at 0.38 g/t gold) as of December 31, 2021, compared to 2.1 million contained ounces gold (170.6 Mt at 0.39 g/t gold) as of December 31, 2020. For 2021, proven and probable gold mineral reserves decreased by 310,000 contained ounces of gold, including the processing of 306,000 contained ounces of gold.\n\u00d6ks\u00fct\nAt the \u00d6ks\u00fct Mine, proven and probable gold mineral reserves total an estimated 1.1 million ounces of contained gold (30.5 Mt at 1.16 g/t gold) at December 31, 2021, compared to the estimated 1.1 million ounces of contained gold (26.3 Mt at 1.34 g/t gold) as at December 31, 2020. Proven and probable gold mineral reserves 2021 depletion (196,000 ounces) was more than offset by an increase of 203,000 contained ounces due to an updated life of mine plan and decrease of the cut-off grade from 0.2 g/t to 0.16 g/t gold.\nKemess\nAt the Kemess Property, the proven and probable gold mineral reserves for the Kemess Underground Project are unchanged at an estimated 1.9 million contained ounces (107.4 Mt at 0.50 g/t gold) as at December 31, 2021.\nMineral Resources\nCenterra\u2019s measured and indicated gold mineral resources decreased by approximately 0.9 million ounces of contained gold to 7.1 million ounces of contained gold (652.9 Mt at 0.34 g/t gold), when compared to the December 31, 2020 estimate. The decrease is a result of the loss of control of the Kumtor Mine (2.3 million ounces as of December 31, 2020), partially off-set by the addition of 1.4 million ounces to the Mount Milligan Mine\u2019s mineral resources as a result of in-fill drilling completed during the 2021 drilling program. All measured and indicated gold resource figures in this section are presented exclusive of gold mineral resources.\nMount Milligan\nAt the Mount Milligan Mine, measured and indicated resources increased by 1.4 million contained ounces of gold, as a result of the infill drilling described above, for a total of 2.8 million ounces of contained gold (284.0 Mt at 0.31 g/t gold) as at December 31, 2021.\n\u00d6ks\u00fct\nAt the \u00d6ks\u00fct Mine, measured and indicated gold resources as at December 31, 2021 increased by 53,000 contained ounces, attributable to an updated resource estimate, offset by processing 196,000 contained ounces of gold during 2021.\nKemess\nAt the Kemess Underground and Kemess East projects, measured and indicated gold resources are unchanged compared to December 31, 2020, totaling 4.0 million ounces of contained gold (351.2 Mt at 0.36 g/t gold).\nInferred Gold Mineral Resources\nThe Company\u2019s inferred gold mineral resource estimate totals 1.0 million contained ounces of gold (95.4 Mt at 0.34 g/t gold) as at December 31, 2021, a decrease of 4.3 million contained ounces when compared to December 31, 2020. The decrease is primarily a result of the loss of control of the Kumtor Mine which resulted in a decrease of 4.4 million contained ounces, partially offset by the addition of 125,000 ounces at the Mount Milligan Mine.\nInferred mineral resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined economically. It cannot be assumed that all or part of the inferred mineral resources will ever be upgraded to a higher category.\nCenterra Year-End Copper Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources\nMineral Reserves\nProven and probable copper mineral reserves total an estimated 1,366 million pounds of contained copper (257 Mt at 0.24% copper).\nMount Milligan\nAt the Mount Milligan Mine, proven and probable copper mineral reserves total an estimated 736 million pounds of contained copper (150 Mt at 0.22% copper) as at December 31, 2021 compared to 837 million pounds of contained copper (171 Mt at 0.22% copper) as at December 31, 2020. The decrease of 101 million contained pounds of copper was primarily due to the processing of 97 million contained pounds of copper in 2021.\nKemess\nThe Kemess Underground Project\u2019s proven and probable copper mineral reserves are unchanged and are estimated to be 630 million pounds of contained copper (107 Mt at 0.27% copper) as at December 31, 2021.\nMineral Resources\nMeasured and indicated copper mineral resources total an estimated 5,783 million pounds of contained copper (1,032 Mt at 0.20% copper).

All measured and indicated copper mineral resource figures in this section are presented exclusive of mineral reserves.\nMount Milligan\nAt the Mount Milligan Mine, measured and indicated mineral resources increased by 453 million pounds of contained copper to an estimated 974 million pounds (284 Mt at 0.16% copper) as at December 31, 2021. The increase in measured and indicated mineral resources resulted from an updated resource estimate upon the completion of the 2021 in-fill drilling program.\nKemess\nAt Kemess, measured and indicated mineral resources are unchanged at 2,107 million pounds of contained copper as at December 31, 2021. The Kemess Underground measured and indicated mineral resources total an estimated 697 million pounds of contained copper (174 Mt at 0.18% copper) and Kemess East measured and indicated mineral resources total an estimated 1,410 million pounds of contained copper (178 Mt at 0.36% copper).\nInferred Copper Mineral Resources\nCenterra\u2019s inferred copper mineral resource estimate totals 539 million pounds of contained copper (108 Mt at 0.16% copper). This includes an estimated 47 million pounds of contained copper (17 Mt at 0.19% copper) at Mount Milligan that represents a year-over-year increase of 19 million pounds of contained copper due to a revised resource estimation and classification. At Kemess inferred copper mineral resources include 210 million pounds of contained copper (48 Mt at 0.20% copper) at Kemess Underground and 203 million pounds of contained copper (29 Mt at 0.31%) at Kemess East, both unchanged from December 31, 2020.\nInferred mineral resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined economically. It cannot be assumed that all or part of the inferred mineral resources will ever be upgraded to a higher category.\nGoldfield\nOn February 22, 2022, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the Goldfield District Project (\u201cGoldfield\u201d) from Waterton Nevada Splitter, LLC. Goldfield consists of three known deposits: Gemfield, Goldfield Main and McMahon Ridge. Centerra is aware that a previous NI 43-101 technical report was published in 2013 on the Goldfield property by a previous owner. Centerra has reviewed that report and subsequent studies on the project as part of its due diligence and expects to further refine and update that work before announcing a resource estimate (expected in the first half of 2023) and an updated feasibility study thereafter.\nTable 1 (see additional footnotes on page 7)\nCenterra Gold Inc. 2021 Year-End Mineral Reserve and Resources Summary \u2013 Gold (1)\n(as at December 31, 2021)\n| Proven and Probable Gold Mineral Reserves | |||||||||\n| Proven | Probable | Total Proven and Probable | |||||||\n| Property | Tonnes | Grade | Contained Gold | Tonnes | Grade | Contained | Tonnes | Grade | Contained |\n| Mount Milligan (4) | 107,444 | 0.39 | 1,342 | 42,531 | 0.36 | 496 | 149,975 | 0.38 | 1,838 |\n| \u00d6ks\u00fct | 494 | 1.23 | 20 | 30,034 | 1.16 | 1,123 | 30,528 | 1.16 | 1,143 |\n| Kemess Underground | - | - | - | 107,381 | 0.50 | 1,868 | 107,381 | 0.50 | 1,868 |\n| Total | 107,938 | 0.39 | 1,362 | 179,946 | 0.60 | 3,487 | 287,884 | 0.52 | 4,849 |\n| Measured and Indicated Gold Mineral Resources (2) | |||||||||\n| Measured | Indicated | Total Measured and Indicated | |||||||\n| Property | Tonnes | Grade | Contained Gold | Tonnes | Grade | Contained | Tonnes | Grade | Contained |\n| Mount Milligan (4) | 134,531 | 0.31 | 1,331 | 149,426 | 0.30 | 1,428 | 283,957 | 0.31 | 2,759 |\n| \u00d6ks\u00fct | 17,720 | 0.50 | 283 | - | - | - | 17,720 | 0.50 | 283 |\n| Kemess Underground | - | - | - | 173,719 | 0.31 | 1,737 | 173,719 | 0.31 | 1,737 |\n| Kemess East | - | - | - | 177,500 | 0.40 | 2,305 | 177,500 | 0.40 | 2,305 |\n| Total | 152,251 | 0.33 | 1,614 | 500,645 | 0.34 | 5,470 | 652,896 | 0.34 | 7,084 |\n| Inferred Gold Mineral Resources (3) | |||||||||\n| Property | Tonnes | Grade | Contained | ||||||\n| Mount Milligan (4) | 17,232 | 0.37 | 203 | ||||||\n| \u00d6ks\u00fct | 1,215 | 0.44 | 17 | ||||||\n| Kemess Underground | 47,700 | 0.34 | 529 | ||||||\n| Kemess East | 29,300 | 0.30 | 283 | ||||||\n| Total | 95,447 | 0.34 | 1,032 |\n1) Centerra\u2019s equity interests as of this news release are as follows: Mount Milligan 100%, \u00d6ks\u00fct 100%, Kemess Underground and Kemess East 100%.

The activities were focused on expanded drilling programs at the Mount Milligan Mine and the \u00d6ks\u00fct Mine, as well as at the Sivritepe Project, which is a greenfield exploration property located in north-eastern Turkey.\nMount Milligan Mine\nThe 2021 diamond drilling program at the Mount Milligan Mine totalled 39,505 metres in 68 drill holes (13,914 metres in 27 exploration drill holes and 25,591 metres in 41 resource expansion drill holes). Primary brownfield exploration targets included zones below the current ultimate open-pit boundary, i.e., MBX Deep and WBX Deep, and on the eastern margin of the open-pit, i.e., Great Eastern Fault (\u201cGEF\u201d) zone, where positive drilling results were returned in 2019 and 2020.\nMount Milligan Brownfield Drilling and Exploration\nExploration and resource expansion drilling continued in the fourth quarter of 2021 with the completion of 22 diamond drill holes totalling 15,445 metres. Fifteen drill holes, totalling 10,024 metres, were completed in the MBX and WBX Deep zones resource expansion/exploration targets below the current ultimate open-pit boundary in the central portion of the deposit. Three drill holes, totalling 2,568 metres, were completed in the DWBX zone planned for resource expansion on the western pit wall. Four drill holes, totalling 2,853 metres, were completed in the GEF zone, testing for both shallow mineralization associated with the GEF, and deeper porphyry mineralization associated with the underlying Great Eastern stock.\nComplete or partial assay results were returned for 22 drill holes, including results from 8 holes drilled in the third quarter of 2021 and 14 holes drilled in the fourth quarter of 2021. These include potential significant mineralization from below the ultimate open-pit boundary in the MBX and WBX Deep zones, and along the western margin of the open-pit in the DWBX zone.\nSelected significant intersections are reported below:\nMBX and WBX Deep Zones (central portion of the open-pit)\n| 21-1349 | 71.1 metres @ 0.67 g/t Gold (\u201cAu\u201d), 0.24% Copper (\u201cCu\u201d) from 3.7 metres including 12.0 metres @ 1.22 g/t Au, 0.36% Cu from 36.0 metres |\n| 21-1339 | 40.9 metres @ 0.13 g/t Au, 0.11% Cu from 24.0 metres |\n| 21-1342 | 73.3 metres @ 0.23 g/t Au, 0.18% Cu from 9.1 metres |\n| 21-1344 (partial results) | 76.0 metres @ 0.26 g/t Au, 0.15% Cu from 3.0 metres |\n| 21-1345 | 53.3 metres @ 0.23 g/t Au, 0.17% Cu from 3.7 metres |\n| 21-1348 | 17.0 metres @ 1.05 g/t Au, 0.11% Cu from 6.0 metres |\n| 21-1351 | 62.1 metres @ 0.16 g/t Au, 0.08% Cu from 7.9 metres |\n| 21-1352 | 63.0 metres @ 0.24 g/t Au, 0.24% Cu from 37.0 metres |\n| 21-1353 | 45.3 metres @ 0.38 g/t Au, 0.17% Cu from 3.7 metres |\n| 21-1354 (partial results) | 112.2 metres @ 0.71 g/t Au, 0.34% Cu from 424.3 metres |\n| 21-1355 (partial results) | 29.0 metres @ 0.27 g/t Au, 0.30% Cu from 3.0 metres |\n| 21-1356 (partial results) | 152.5 metres @ 0.35 g/t Au, 0.06% Cu from 6.4 metres |\nDWBX Zone (western margin of the open-pit)\n| 21-1335 | 113.0 metres @ 0.22 g/t Au, 0.17% Cu from 260.0 metres |\n| 21-1336 | 196.5 metres @ 0.33 g/t Au, 0.35% Cu from 84.5 metres |\n| 21-1337 | 53.1 metres @ 0.17 g/t Au, 0.24% Cu from 319.0 metres |\n| 21-1338 | 15.3 metres @ 1.10 g/t Au, 0.34% Cu from 318.7 metres |\n| 21-1340 | 26.0 metres @ 0.68 g/t Au, 0.10% Cu from 145.0 metres |\n| 21-1346 (partial results | 90.0 metres @ 0.22 g/t Au, 0.31% Cu from 80.0 metres |\n| 21-1350 (partial results) | 181.7 metres @ 0.92 g/t Au, 0.27% Cu from 333.0 metres |\nAssay results returned from the MBX Deep zone during the fourth quarter of 2021 show wide intercepts of potentially significant mineralization below the ultimate open-pit boundary. Porphyry-style mineralization is associated with potassic altered latite-andesite units in the footwall of the MBX monzonite porphyry stock. All lithologies are variably crosscut by early, transitional, and late-stage veins. To date, the tested dimensions of the MBX Deep zone are approximately 200 metres (north-northeast to south-southwest) by 140 metres (east to west) with an average width of 110 metres, for significant intervals, and potential to expand to the south and to the east. A second series of fault-bound monzonite porphyry intrusions with potassic alteration \u00b1 mineralized early veins have been drilled at depth underlying the ultimate pit boundary and the MBX stock by approximately 400 metres to 600 metres.\nAssay results returned from the DWBX zone during the fourth quarter show wide intercepts of porphyry-style mineralization along the western margins of the ultimate pit boundary, with narrow intercepts of vein associated high gold-low copper mineralization. Porphyry-style mineralization is associated with potassic alteration and early quartz veins within the DWBX composite stock and the stock margins. A moderately west-dipping hydrothermal breccia body has been identified at shallow depth in host volcanic rocks in the northern part of the DWBX zone. This feature is believed to be associated with emplacement of porphyry stocks and remains to be tested down-dip to the west and into the Goldmark stock footwall volcanic rocks. Results returned from the DWBX zone in 2021 show potential for resource expansion to the west of the current ultimate pit boundary.\nThe above mineralized intercepts were calculated using a cut-off grade of 0.1 g/t Au or 0.1% Cu and a maximum internal dilution interval of 4.0 metres. Significant assay intervals reported represent apparent widths due to the undefined geometry of mineralization in this zone, relationship between fault blocks, and conceptual nature of the exploration target.

In the fourth quarter of 2021, drilling program mainly focused on developing the Keltepe North (\u201cKeltepe N\u201d) and Keltepe Northwest (\u201cKeltepe NW\u201d) oxide gold satellite resources and targeting geochemical gold and geophysical anomalism at the B\u00fcy\u00fcktepe, Yelibelen and Boztepe prospects. In addition to these areas, the drilling in the fourth quarter confirmed the discovery of a new mineralized zone, Keltepe North-Northwest (\u201cKeltepe NNW\u201d), which has the potential to be another satellite deposit.\nA total of 31,525 metres in 159 drill holes were completed in the 2021 drilling program. The 2021 drilling program contributed to increased resource expansion and development around the known deposits (Keltepe, G\u00fcneytepe, Keltepe N and Keltepe NW). The oxide gold mineralization that has been delineated at Keltepe N, Keltepe NW and now at Keltepe NNW requires additional infill drilling, which will commence in the first quarter of 2022.\nAll the outstanding core samples were dispatched to the assay lab by the end of the year. As the priority was given to the analysis of samples from Keltepe N, Keltepe NW, and Keltepe NNW, most of the assay results from B\u00fcy\u00fcktepe, Yelibelen and Boztepe prospects are still pending. Significant mineralized intercepts were received from Keltepe N, Keltepe NW and Keltepe NNW. Selected significant intersections are reported below:\nKeltepe North (resource expansion oxide gold)\n| ODD0574 | 55.0 metres @ 0.93 g/t Au from 126.4 metres |\n| ODD0591 | 16.7 metres @ 1.20 g/t Au from 15.7 metres |\n| ODD0614 | 42.3 metres @ 1.21 g/t Au from 26.7 metres |\n| ODD0616 | 37.3 metres @ 0.53 g/t Au from 11.4 metres |\nKeltepe North-West (resource expansion oxide gold)\n| ODD0596 | 33.0 metres @ 0.48 g/t Au from 65.7 metres |\n| ODD0620 | 36.0 metres @ 0.87 g/t Au from 10.7 metres |\n| ODD0622 | 19.3 metres @ 0.3 g/t Au from 22.9 metres |\nKeltepe North-Northwest (oxide gold)\n| ODD0593 | 68.9 metres @ 0.41 g/t Au from 18.6 metres |\n| ODD0612 | 91.7 metres @ 0.33 g/t Au from 62.5 metres |\nThe above mineralized intercepts were calculated using a cut-off grade of 0.2 g/t Au and a maximum internal dilution interval of 5.0 metres. The true widths of the mineralized intervals reported represent approximately 60% to 90% of the stated downhole interval. Drill collar locations and associated graphics are available at the following link:\nhttps://ml.globenewswire.com/media/63702a77-3ee8-4dac-b4c3-ccff21f3d4a7/document/?v=02242022094200\nA full listing of the drill results, drill hole locations and plan map (including the azimuth, dip of drill holes, and depth of the sample intervals) for the \u00d6ks\u00fct Mine have been filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and EDGAR at www.sec.gov/edgar and are available on the Company\u2019s website at www.centerragold.com.\nOther Projects Turkey\nSivritepe Project\nThe 2021 diamond drilling program was completed with a further 20 drill holes being drilled in the fourth quarter for a total of 4,662 metres. A total of 15,459 metres in 62 drill holes were completed in 2021. Drilling mainly targeted gold-in-soil geochemical anomalism and succeeded in identifying multiple mineralized zones. Drilling at the two major prospects, Sivritepe West and Sivritepe East, was specifically designed to be able to define potential gold resources. The drilling data received to date indicates that the identified mineralized zones are still open along strike and at depth and need to be targeted by infill and step-out drilling in the 2022 drilling season.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, drilling was focused on the Sivritepe West Prospect, where the extent of the east-west trending gold mineralized zone was outlined at surface by a nearly one km long gold-in-soil geochemical anomaly. It is interpreted that gold mineralization is related to the contact between magmatic-hydrothermal breccias and trachy-andesitic intrusive rocks. All the drill holes returned anomalous oxide and/or sulfide gold mineralized intervals.\nSelected significant intersections are reported below:\nSivritepe West (oxide gold)\n| STW0026 | 12.5 metres @ 0.56 g/t Au from 8.0 metres |\n| STW0027 | 35.0 metres @ 0.40 g/t Au from the surface |\n| STW0028 | 22.0 metres @ 0.47 g/t Au from 47.0 metres |\n| STW0040 | 48.0 metres @ 0.30 g/t Au from 37.0 metres |\nSivritepe West (sulfide gold)\n| STW0022 | 51.1 metres @ 0.41 g/t Au from 137.0 metres |\n| STW0024 | 26.6 metres @ 0.60 g/t Au from 247.0 metres |\n| STW0039 | 16.7 metres @ 2.34 g/t Au from 199.3 metres |\nThe above mineralized intercepts were calculated using a cut-off grade of 0.1 g/t Au and a maximum internal dilution interval of 5.0 metres. The true widths of the mineralized intervals reported represent approximately 30%-85% of the stated downhole interval and averages around 60%.

The entire Phase-2 program comprised 4,704 metres of drilling in 15 drill holes. In the fourth quarter of 2021, there were 3,842 metres drilled in 12 drill holes. Drilling tested geophysical anomalies and areas with coincident near-surface kaolinite clay alteration for low-sulfidation epithermal gold-silver vein mineralization over a strike distance of 2.4 kilometres. Five target zones were tested, including Borrow Pit, Saki, Shinju, Western and Gold Hill zones. As of the end of the quarter, all final assay results are pending.\nAdditional exploration activities in the fourth quarter included the completion of a controlled-source audio frequency magnetotellurics survey (CSAMT; 26.6 line-kilometres), a tensor AMT survey (four line-kilometres), an induced polarization survey (1.8 line-kilometres), and a ground magnetic survey (33 line-kilometres).\nQualified Person & QA/QC \u2013 Exploration\nExploration information and related scientific and technical information in this document regarding the Mount Milligan Mine were prepared in accordance with the standards of NI 43-101 and were prepared, reviewed, verified, and compiled by Cheyenne Sica, Member of the Association of Professional Geoscientists Ontario, Exploration Manager at Centerra\u2019s Mount Milligan Mine, who is the qualified person for the purpose of NI 43-101.

Such forward-looking information involves risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results, performance, prospects and opportunities to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking information. The words \u201cbelieve\u201d, \u201cexpect\u201d, \u201canticipate\u201d, \u201ccontemplate\u201d, \u201ctarget\u201d, \u201cplan\u201d, \u201cintends\u201d, \u201ccontinue\u201d, \u201cbudget\u201d, \u201cestimate\u201d, \u201cmay\u201d, \u201cwill\u201d, \u201cschedule\u201d and similar expressions identify forward-looking information. These forward-looking statements relate to, among other things, mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates, life of mine estimates and operating and capital costs; future exploration potential; timing and scope of future exploration (brownfields or greenfields); and anticipated costs and expenditures and other information that is based on forecasts of future operational or financial results, estimates of amounts not yet determinable, and assumptions of management. Forward-looking information is necessarily based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by Centerra, are inherently subject to significant political, business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. Known and unknown factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking information. For a full list of the risk factors that can affect the Company, see its management\u2019s discussion and analysis for the year ended December 31, 2021 and its most recently filed annual information form.\nMarket price fluctuations in gold, copper and other metals, as well as increased capital or production costs or reduced recovery rates may render ore reserves containing lower grades of mineralization uneconomic and may ultimately result in a restatement of mineral reserves. The extent to which mineral resources may ultimately be reclassified as proven or probable mineral reserves is dependent upon the demonstration of their profitable recovery. Economic and technological factors which may change over time always influence the evaluation of mineral reserves or mineral resources. Centerra has not adjusted mineral resource figures in consideration of these risks and, therefore, Centerra can give no assurances that any mineral resource estimate will ultimately be reclassified as proven and probable mineral reserves.\nMineral resources are not mineral reserves, and do not have demonstrated economic viability, but do have reasonable prospects for economic extraction. Measured and indicated mineral resources are sufficiently well defined to allow geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed and permit the application of technical and economic parameters in assessing the economic viability of the resource. Inferred mineral resources are estimated on limited information not sufficient to verify geological and grade continuity or to allow technical and economic parameters to be applied. Inferred mineral resources are too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them to enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. There is no certainty that mineral resources of any category can be upgraded to mineral reserves through continued exploration.\nCenterra\u2019s mineral reserve and mineral resource figures are estimates and Centerra can provide no assurances that the indicated levels of gold or copper will be produced or that Centerra will receive the metal prices assumed in determining its mineral reserves. Such estimates are expressions of judgment based on knowledge, mining experience, analysis of drilling results and industry practices. Valid estimates made at a given time may significantly change when new information becomes available. While Centerra believes that these mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates are well established and the best estimates of Centerra\u2019s management, by their nature mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates are imprecise and depend, to a certain extent, upon analysis of drilling results and statistical inferences which may ultimately prove unreliable. If Centerra\u2019s mineral reserve or mineral reserve estimates for its properties are inaccurate or are reduced in the future, this could have an adverse impact on Centerra\u2019s future cash flows, earnings, results or operations and financial condition.\nCenterra estimates the future mine life of its operations. Centerra can give no assurance that mine life estimates will be achieved. Failure to achieve these estimates could have an adverse impact on Centerra\u2019s future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial condition.\nThere can be no assurances that forward-looking information and statements will prove to be accurate, as many factors and future events, both known and unknown could cause actual results, performance or achievements to vary or differ materially, from the results, performance or achievements that are or may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained herein or incorporated by reference. Accordingly, all such factors should be considered carefully when making decisions with respect to Centerra, and prospective investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking information. Forward-looking information is as of February 25, 2022. Centerra assumes no obligation to update or revise forward looking information to reflect changes in assumptions, changes in circumstances or any other events affecting such forward-looking information, except as required by applicable law.\nAbout Centerra\nCenterra Gold Inc. is a Canadian-based gold mining company focused on operating, developing, exploring and acquiring gold properties in North America, Turkey, and other markets worldwide.

The Environmental and Mine Operating Permits provide for all aspects of the Bibiani Mine development, including operation and expansion, re-alignment of the National Highway, management of water and tailings, transport and utilization of explosives, mining and processing.\nDouglas MacQuarrie, President & CEO, stated: \u201cRe-start of open pit mining at Bibiani after 17 years of restructuring and development marks an exciting milestone for Ghana, for Asante and especially for the community. We thank the Ghana Environmental Protection Agency and Minerals Commission, and the Chiefs and local communities for their overwhelming support and commitment to the Bibiani Mine Project and the approval of our permits.\nWhen we purchased the asset in late August 2021, we were reminded that \u2018Bibiani is the mine and the mine is Bibiani\u2019, with a history of more than 100 years of peaceful and mutually profitable co-operation. We are excited and humbled to have earned the opportunity to bring this high-grade Ghanaian gold mine back to production and add to the near 5 million ounces of historical production.\u201d\nDave Anthony, COO, added: \u201cAll activities and initiatives needed to bring the Bibiani Mine to production of gold at Q3 2022 are on track.\nPW Mining (Ghana) was selected as the Mining Contractor in December 2021. Mobilization and site establishment has accelerated into February and is currently two months ahead of schedule, such that more than 75 items of heavy equipment and maintenance facilities are now at site. The full fleet for open pit mining will eventually grow to 130 units, to enable treatment of 3.0 Mtpa.\nFurther, Process Plant refurbishment is on schedule and on budget, with +60% of the scheduled work complete. All work activities are proceeding as planned. Principal equipment drives were taken off site in 2021, to be serviced as needed. These are now being returned to site for installation. Electrical components, instrumentation and control systems have been tested and are being upgraded as needed, to provide improved performance, relative to the original design. With the purchase and installation of an up-to-date Knelson 6G concentrator and Gekko ILR (intensive leach reactor), the gravity recovery circuit has been upgraded to \u201cmodel year 2021\u201d level of competence and automation.\nLocal sub-contractors have been engaged to proceed with earthworks, metal and pipework repair, painting, installation of liners and belts, in order to ensure a safe and efficient operation. Equipment that was purchased, but not made operational by the former owners, is being made ready for commissioning and operation. As of mid-February, there are more than 900 contractors and employees working at the process plant site.\nThe Bibiani Mine plans to pour its first gold in Q3 2022 and to produce approximately 175,000 oz of gold in its first 12 months of operation. Thereafter, the Bibiani Mine plans to produce 220,000 to 270,000 ounces every year for a minimum of 7 years\u201d.\nAsante is planning to initiate development of an underground mine design at the PEA level of study in Q3 2022, with a view to developing an underground mine operation from 2026. This will provide significant overlap with open pit mining operations, which are currently scheduled to proceed into 2029.\u201d\n\"Douglas R. MacQuarrie\"\u201cDave Anthony P.

Readers should refer to section 15 \u201cNon-GAAP Performance Measures\u201d of Q2 MD&A.\nQ2 FY2022 Production Analysis\nQ2 FY2022 gold production was 1,683oz, a 43% decrease as compared to 2,963oz for Q2 FY2021. The decrease resulted from heavy rain and a large quantity of super low-grade ore being fed into the mill although gold recovery was slightly higher.\nQ2 FY2022 ore processed decreased to 129,000t from 152,836t for Q2 FY2021. The decreased mill feed was mainly due to less oxide ore and old tailings being fed into plant.\nAverage mill feed grade was 0.56g/t Au in Q2 FY2022 as compared to 0.89g/t Au of Q2 FY2021. Q2 FY2022 processing recovery rate increased to 63.2% from 58.4% for Q2 FY2021. The slight increase in processing recovery rate was mainly due to significant increase in Peranggih oxide materials being processed.\nQ2 FY2022 cash cost per ounce increased by 64% to $1,810/oz from $1,103/oz for Q2 FY2021. This increase was primarily due to a significant reduction in the mill feed grade from 0.89g/t Au to 0.56g/t Au and significantly more low-grade leachable sulphide ore and low-grade Peranggih materials being processed.\nOre stockpile has reduced mainly as a result of lower mining rate primarily due to heavy rain in both Selinsing pit and Peranggih pit especially towards to the end of the quarter.\nQ2 FY2022 Financial Analysis\nQ2 FY2022 gold sales generated revenue was $5.05 million as compared to $6.84 million from Q2 FY2021. Gold sales revenue was derived from the sale of 2,150oz (Q2 FY2021: 3,050oz) of gold at an average realized gold price of $1,828 per ounce (Q2 FY2021: $1,889 per ounce) and the delivery of 723oz (Q2 FY2021: 704 oz at $1,525 per ounce gold equivalent) in fulfilling gold prepaid sale obligations.\nQ2 FY2022 total production costs increased by 26% to $5.20 million as compared to $4.14 million from Q1 FY2021. Cash cost per ounce increased by 64% to $1,810/oz as compared to $1,103/oz of the same period last year. The increase was attributable to a 45% decrease in the mill feed grade from 0.89g/t to 0.56g/t, heavy rain, offset by an increase in recovery to 63.2% (Q2 FY2021: 58.4%), as a result of processing significantly more leachable sulphide ore and other low grade ores.\nGross margin for Q2 FY2022 was negative $0.15 million before operation expenses and non-cash amortization and accretion. That represented an 106% decrease as compared to $2.69million from Q2 FY2021. The decrease in gross margin was attributable to significant lower grade ore feed, much lower volume of gold sold, and increased cash costs.\nNet loss for Q2 FY2022 was $2.50 million, or ($0.01) per share as compared to net loss of $0.65 million or ($0.00) per share from Q2 FY2021. The net loss was mainly caused by lower operating margins impacted by heavy rain.\nCash and cash equivalents balance as at December 31, 2021 was $27.79 million, a decrease of $10.83 million from the balance at June 30, 2021 of $38.62 million due to $4 million used in operation activities, $5.5 million development cost in Selinsing including $3.8 million spent in sulphide project development, and $1.3 million spent in Murchison exploration and maintenance activities . As at December 31, 2021, the Company had positive working capital of $38.61 million as compared to that at June 30, 2021 of $48.54 million.\nDevelopment\nSelinsing Gold Mine\nThe Sulphide project development comprises the Stage 1 Flotation plant project and Stage 2 BIOX\u00ae leaching plant. The flotation plant construction includes project management, project validation, flotation design and engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning. Mine development included upgrading of tailing storage facilities, pit push backs, and river diversion. The flotation plant is expected to be completed by June 2022 with an estimated cost of up to $20 million. As of December 31, 2021, 37% of overall project has been completed.\nDuring Q2 FY2022 Mincore Pty Ltd. (\u201cMincore\u201d) completed the detailed engineering design of the flotation plant. Equipment specifications and data sheets were completed, and material take-offs and bills of material were issued for concrete, structural steel, piping, valves and electric cables instrumentation. All civil and structural, mechanical and piping drawings were issued for construction. Purchase orders for major long lead items of equipment were sent to the selected manufacturers. During the quarter the construction contract has been awarded to Seong Henng Engineering Works Sdn Bhd, an experienced Malaysian contractor which carried out the Selinsing Oxide Plant construction over 10 years ago.\nDuring Q2 FY2022, R&D work produced the sample of flotation concentrate for pressure filtration testwork by the filter press supplier McLanahan. It is also achieved a key milestone that the pilot plant was successfully commissioned into operation, comprised ball mill and classifier, rougher / scavenger flotation cells and three stages of cleaner flotation. Samples of flotation concentrate was produced and a sample of this was sent to McLanahan for filter press testwork. Antimony leaching tests was carried out to support gold concentrates marketing effort.\nThe Tail Storage Facility expansion progressed 91.9% as of December 31, 2021, reached the 537m RL, which provides adequate capacity till May 2023.\nMurchison Gold Project\nNo mine development was planned during the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, with the focus on exploration at Murchison. Murchison Project development is put on hold. The processing plant and other facilities are under care and maintenance and in good condition. Site accommodations and catering are fully functional to host administrative, exploration and mining activities.\nExploration Progress\nMalaysia\nPeranggih is currently the focus for identifying additional mineable material to extend production from the oxide plant at Selinsing. In the Phase 1 and 2 Reverse Circulation (\u201cRC\u201d) drilling programs at Peranggih approximately 70% of holes have hit gold mineralization above an oxide cut-off (>0.35g/t Au) at less than 50m below the surface, defining a mineralized zone 830m long and 60m wide. Exploration in the second quarter of FY2022 comprised of 396 channel samples, which tested extensions to known mineralization at Peranggih, where follow-up RC drilling is planned in Q3 FY2022, and a new prospect at Mentique, where further mapping and sampling are to be undertaken.\nWestern Australia\nAt the Murchison Gold Project, the Phase 1 RC and Air Core (\u201cAC\u201d) drill program completion was announced and comprised 3,465m in 46 RC holes and 10,484m in 349 AC holes, which were designed to test new targets away from known resources. All assays from the Phase 1 drilling were received in January 2022, subsequent to the end of the second quarter, and significant intercepts include 5m at 1.53 g/t Au from 31m (21BNRC037), 2m at 0.81 g/t Au from 111m and 3m at 1.91 g/t Au from 119m (21BNRC038) and 2m at 1.56 g/t Au from 60m and 2m at 3.70g/t Au from 106m (21BNRC039) at Munro Bore, 8m at 0.97g/t Au from 5m (21BNRC008) and 7m at 0.82g/t Au from 18m (21BNRC026) at FLC2, and 3m at 10.2g/t Au from 22m (21BNAC213) at the newly discovered Junction Target.\nA Phase 2 RC and diamond drilling (DD) program commenced in November 2021, and a total of 2,918m in 12 RC holes were completed during the second quarter of FY2022, testing for extensions to known mineralization and resources at the NOA1, NOA2, NOA78 and Alliance target areas. 1,406 RC samples from the Phase 2 drilling were dispatched to ALS Geochemistry in Perth during the quarter. DD drilling was rearranged and postponed to March 2022 due to availability of the drill rigs. The Phase 2 drilling program is expected to be completed by the end of March 2022.\nAbout Monument\nMonument Mining Limited (TSX-V: MMY, FSE: D7Q1) is an established Canadian gold producer that 100% owns and operates the Selinsing Gold Mine in Malaysia and the Murchison Gold Project in the Murchison area of Western Australia.

Please refer to section \"Assumptions and Parameters\" and Table 3 for differences in assumptions and parameters between 2022 MRE and 2021 Estimate2 |\nKeyvan Salehi, President & CEO commented: \"We are extremely pleased with the results of the updated 2022 MRE, which exceeded our own expectations. The shift in our strategy early last year towards higher-grade, pit-constrained mineralization, combined with a much more accelerated and aggressive approach towards exploration, have resulted in a significant expansion in the OP mineral resource estimates at our property. We have successfully increased our OP mineral resource estimates to approximately 2.1 million ounces in the Indicated category and 0.6 million ounces in the Inferred category. After evaluating all the data and working towards a future conceptual mine plan, we believe that the scalability of the project to a potentially robust, large open-pit operation, far outweighs the marginal decrease in overall OP grades compared to the 2021 Estimate. With just over 72,000 metres of drilling completed last year, our current evaluations and consideration of the project benefit tremendously from the extensive information received from our 2021 drill campaign.\"\n\"We are particularly excited about the contributions of higher-grade, near-surface mineralization from the Kim & Cass, Damoti, and Treasure Island deposits. These four deposits combined represent approximately 0.5 million ounces grading 2.62 g/t Au of Inferred estimated mineral resources in the 2022 MRE. These higher-grade deposits remain open along strike and at depth providing an opportunity to further enhance the global mineral resource estimated grades with additional drilling. Our 2022 exploration program will focus on expanding higher-grade mineralization, whilst continuously looking at the entire property for additional higher-grade targets and long-term opportunities. We look forward to providing timely updates on our 2022 exploration program and other developments.\"\n2022 MRE\nThe 2022 MRE benefits from 39,065 metres (\"m\") of drilling information from the 2021 and 2020 (drill data that was not included in the 2021 Estimate2) exploration programs. Mineral resource expansion drilling in 2021 was principally on-strike of the deposits, to increase drill density in areas where drill data was limited and to test the lateral extent of smaller deposits. The 2022 MRE is comprised of nine (9) deposits. Five (5) deposits are located within the Colomac Centre (Colomac Main, Goldcrest, Grizzly Bear, 24 and 27). The remaining four (4) satellite deposits are located between 11 km to 28 km from the Colomac Centre (Kim, Cass, Damoti, and Treasure Island) and demonstrate typically higher-grade OP mineralization compared to the deposits within the Colomac Centre (please refer to Figure 1 for a regional map of the Indin Lake Gold Property). The Damoti Deposit was re-evaluated as a potential OP deposit in the 2022 MRE (it was considered a potential UG deposit in the 2021 Estimate2) due to the proximity of the known mineralization to the surface and land access. Please refer to Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 for the mineral resource estimate longitudinal section views of the Colomac Main, Cass, Kim, Damoti Lake, and Treasure Island deposits, respectively.\nThe 2022 MRE was generated using various cut-off grades: Between 0.50-0.63 g/t Au for potential OP mineralization (depending on the deposit) and 1.02-1.83 g/t Au for the potential UG mineralization (depending on the deposit and UG extraction \u2013 bulk or selective). Specific extraction methods are used only to establish reasonable cut-off grades for various portions of the deposits. No Preliminary Economic Analysis, Pre-Feasibility Study or Feasibility Study has been completed to support economic viability and technical feasibility of exploiting any portion of the mineral resources, by any specified mining method. The reasonable prospect for an eventual economical extraction is met by having used reasonable cut-off grades both for a potential OP and UG extraction scenarios and constraining volumes (Deswik shapes and optimized pit-shell).\nAssumptions and Parameters\nThe 2022 MRE includes a few assumptions and parameters that are different compared to the 2021 Estimate2. Please see Table 3 for a summary of the assumptions and parameters for the 2022 MRE and 2021 Estimate2. Due to the significant expansion in the potential OP mineralization at Colomac Centre and the satellite deposits, the Company and its independent consultants believe that there is potential for a future, large-scale, OP operation at its properties. A potential large-scale OP operation would entail lower cost per tonne assumptions, which resulted in a lower estimated OP cut-off grade range in the 2022 MRE compared to the 2021 Estimate2. In addition, the lower cut-off grades in the 2022 MRE resulted in a larger amount of mineralized blocks above the cut-off grade and a slight decrease in average grades compared to the 2021 Estimate2. The larger amount of mineralized blocks above the cut-off grade provides more flexibility to build an optimal conceptual mine plan in the future.\nTable 3: Comparison between 2022 MRE and 2021 Estimate2 \u2013 Assumptions and Parameters\nCategory | Key Assumptions and Parameters | ||\n2022 MRE | 2021 Estimate2 | Details | |\nGold price | US$1,600/oz | US$1,650/oz | Lower gold price assumption in 2022 MRE |\nCost assumptions | Mining: C$3.25/t (OP bulk); Processing: C$21.00/t G&A: C$6/t Refining/selling: C$5-53/oz | Mining: C$3.75/t (OP bulk); C$65.00/t (UG selective) Processing: C$22.50/t G&A: C$8/t Refining/selling: C$5/oz | The Company is potentially contemplating |\nCut-off grade | OP: 0.50-0.63 g/t Au UG (bulk): 1.02 g/t Au UG (selective): 1.45-1.83 g/t Au | OP: 0.60 g/t Au UG (bulk): 1.10 g/t Au UG (selective): 2.00 g/t Au | The Company has decided upon a lower cut- |\n2022 Exploration Program\nThe Company is currently evaluating the 2022 MRE and finalizing the 2022 Exploration Program. The 2022 Exploration Program will be carried out in a phased approach and will focus on expanding the potential OP mineralization of the higher-grade deposits, particularly Kim, Cass, Damoti, and Treasure Island.\nTechnical Information\nNighthawk has implemented a quality-control program to comply with best practices in the sampling and analysis of drill core. Drill core samples were transported in security-sealed bags for analyses at ALS Global Assay Laboratory in Vancouver, BC (\"ALS Global\"). ALS Global is an ISO/IEC 17025 accredited laboratory. Pulp and metallics assaying for gold were conducted on the entire pulverized sample.\nAs part of its QA/QC program, Nighthawk inserts external gold standards (low to high-grade) and blanks every 20 samples in addition to the standards, blanks, and pulp duplicates inserted by ALS Global.\nTechnical Report and Qualified Persons\nA Technical Report prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 (as defined below) in support of the 2022 MRE will be filed on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) before March 31, 2022. Readers are encouraged to read the Technical Report in its entirety, including all qualifications, assumptions and exclusions that relate to the 2022 MRE. The Technical Report is intended to be read as a whole, and sections should not be read or relied upon out of context.\nTechnical information related to the 2021 MRE contained in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Marina Iund, M.Sc., P.Geo., Carl Pelletier, P.Geo., and Simon Boudreau, P.Eng. of InnovExplo, who are Independent and Qualified Persons as defined by NI 43-101, with the ability and authority to verify the authenticity and validity of this data.\nRichard Roy P.Geo., V.P. Exploration of Nighthawk, who is the Qualified Person as defined by NI 43-101 for this project, has reviewed and approved of the scientific and technical disclosure contained in this news release.\nAbout Nighthawk\nNighthawk is a Canadian-based gold exploration company with 100% ownership of more than 930 km2 of district-scale land position within the Indin Lake Greenstone Belt, located approximately 200 km north of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada. The Company is advancing several highly prospective exploration targets. Nighthawk's experienced management team, with a track record of successfully advancing projects and operating mines, is working towards demonstrating the economic viability of its assets and rapidly advancing its projects towards a development decision.\nKeyvan Salehi President & CEO | Michael Leskovec CFO | Allan Candelario VP, Investor Relations |\nNotes to accompany the 2022 MRE\nNotes to accompany the Mineral Resource Estimate:\nThe independent and qualified persons for the mineral resource estimate, as defined by NI 43-101, are Marina Iund, P.Geo., Carl Pelletier, P.Geo. and Simon Boudreau, P.Eng. all from InnovExplo Inc., and the effective date is March 7, 2022.\nThese mineral resources are not mineral reserves, as they do not have demonstrated economic viability. The mineral resource estimate follows current CIM definitions and guidelines.\nThe results are presented undiluted and are considered to have reasonable prospects of economic viability.\nThe estimate encompasses nine (9) gold deposits (Cass, Colomac, Damoti, Goldcrest, Grizzly Bear, Kim, Treasure Island, 24 and 27), subdivided into 106 individual zones (3 for Cass, 6 for Colomac, 38 for Damoti, 3 for Goldcrest, 4 for Grizzly Bear, 1 for Kim, 45 for Treasure Island, 4 for 24 and 2 for 27) using the grade of the adjacent material when assayed or a value of zero when not assayed. Five (5) low-grade envelopes were created: 1 for Colomac (quartz diorite dyke) and 4 for Damoti (BIF).\nHigh-grade capping supported by statistical analysis was done on raw assay data before compositing and established on a per-zone basis varying from 30 to 100 g/t Au for mineralized zones and 15 to 20 g/t Au for the envelopes.\nThe estimate was completed using sub-block models in GEOVIA Surpac 2021, except Treasure Island was estimated using sub-block model in Leapfrog Edge 2021.1.\nGrade interpolation was performed with the ID3 method on 1.5 m composites for the Colomac, Goldcrest and Grizzly Bear deposits, with the ID2 method on 1 m composites for the Cass and Treasure Island deposits, with the ID3 method on 1 m composites for the Kim deposit, with the ID2 method on 1.5 m composites for the 24/27 deposits, and with the OK method on 1.0 m composites for the Damoti deposit.\nA density of value of 3.2 g/cm3 (Damoti), 3.0 g/cm3 (Cass), 2.95 g/cm3 (Kim), 2.7 g/cm3 (Colomac, Goldcrest, Grizzly Bear, Treasure Island and 24/27,) and 2.00 g/cm3 (overburden) was assigned.\nThe mineral resource estimate is classified as Indicated and Inferred. For the Cass, Colomac, Goldcrest and Grizzly Bear, Kim, Treasure Island, 27 and 27 deposits, the Inferred category is defined with a minimum of two (2) drill holes within the areas where the drill spacing is less than 75 m and shows reasonable geological and grade continuity. The Indicated mineral resource category is defined with a minimum of tree (3) drill holes within the areas where the drill spacing is less than 50 m. For the Damoti deposit, the Inferred category is defined with a minimum of two (2) drill holes within the areas where the drill spacing is less than 60 m and shows reasonable geological and grade continuity. Clipping boundaries were used for classification based on those criteria.\nThe mineral resource estimate is locally pit-constrained with a bedrock slope angle of 50\u00b0 and an overburden slope angle of 30\u00b0. It is reported at a rounded cut-off grade of 0.50 to 0.63 g/t Au (OP), 1.02 g/t Au (UG bulk) and 1.45 to 1.83 g/t Au (UG selective). The cut-off grades were calculated using the following parameters: mining cost = CA$3.25/t to CA$ 73.00/t; processing cost = CA$21.00/t; G&A = CA$6.00/t; refining costs = CA$5.00/oz; selling costs = CA$ 5.00/oz to CA$53.00/oz; gold price = US$1,600.00/oz; USD:CAD exchange rate = 1.25; and mill recovery = 97.0%. The cut-off grades should be re-evaluated in light of future prevailing market conditions (metal prices, exchange rates, mining costs etc.).\nThe number of metric tonnes was rounded to the nearest thousand, following the recommendations in NI 43 101 and any discrepancies in the totals are due to rounding effects. The metal contents are presented in troy ounces (tonnes x grade / 31.10348).\nThe authors are not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title-related, taxation, socio-political, or marketing issues, or any other relevant issue not reported in the Technical Report, that could materially affect the Mineral Resource Estimate.\nForward-Looking Information\nThis news release contains \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation. Forward-looking information includes, but is not limited to, information with respect to: the Company's mineral resource estimates, continued exploration and drilling initiatives, assumptions on extending mineralization, the prospectivity of exploration targets, the potential economic viability of the assets, the potential for a future large-scale, OP operation in the district, and the advancement of projects towards a development decision. Generally, forward-looking information can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \"appears\", \"increase\", \"forward\", \"updating\", \"justification\", \"add\" or \"additional\", \"support\", \"plans\", \"expected\" or \"expectations\", \"budget\", \"scheduled\", \"estimates\", \"forecasts\", \"potentially\", \"prospective\", \"prioritize\", \"reflects\", \"goal\", \"will be\" or \"will consider\", \"can be\", \"intends\", \"advancing\", \"work towards\", \"demonstrating\", \"towards\", \"opportunity\", \"re-envisioning\", \"anticipates\", or \"does not anticipate\", or \"believes\" or variations of such words and phrases or state that certain actions, events or results \"may\", \"could\", \"would\", \"might\", or \"will be taken\", \"occur\", or \"be achieved\".\nForward-looking information is based on the opinions and estimates of management at the date the information is made, and is based on a number of assumptions and is subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements of Nighthawk to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking information, including risks associated with the exploration, development and mining such as economic factors as they effect exploration, future commodity prices, changes in foreign exchange and interest rates, actual results of current exploration activities, government regulation, political or economic developments, environmental risks, permitting timelines, capital expenditures, operating or technical difficulties in connection with development activities, employee relations, the speculative nature of gold exploration and development, including the risks of diminishing quantities of grades of reserves, contests over title to properties, and changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined as well as those risk factors discussed in Nighthawk's annual information form for the year ended December 31, 2020, available on www.sedar.com. Although Nighthawk has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking information, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that such information will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such information. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking information. Nighthawk does not undertake to update any forward-looking information, except in accordance with applicable securities laws.\nCautionary Statement regarding Mineral Resource Estimates\nUntil mineral deposits are actually mined and processed, Mineral Resources must be considered as estimates only. Mineral Resource estimates that are not Mineral Reserves and have not demonstrated economic viability. The estimation of Mineral Resources is inherently uncertain, involves subjective judgement about many relevant factors and may be materially affected by, among other things, environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political, marketing, or other relevant risks, uncertainties, contingencies and other factors described in the Company's public disclosure available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com. The quantity and grade of reported \"Inferred\" Mineral Resource estimates are uncertain in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to define \"Inferred\" Mineral Resource estimates as an \"Indicated\" or \"Measured\" Mineral Resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading \"Inferred\" Mineral Resource estimates to an \"Indicated\" or \"Measured\" Mineral Resource category. The accuracy of any Mineral Resource estimates is a function of the quantity and quality of available data, and of the assumptions made and judgments used in engineering and geological interpretation, which may prove to be unreliable and depend, to a certain extent, upon the analysis of drilling results and statistical inferences that may ultimately prove to be inaccurate. Mineral Resource estimates may have to be re-estimated based on, among other things: (i) fluctuations in mineral prices; (ii) results of drilling, and development; (iii) results of future test mining and other testing; (iv) metallurgical testing and other studies; (v) results of geological and structural modeling including block model design; (vi) proposed mining operations, including dilution; (vii) the evaluation of future mine plans subsequent to the date of any estimates; and (viii) the possible failure to receive required permits, licenses and other approvals. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of a \"inferred\" or \"indicated\" Mineral Resource estimate will ever be upgraded to a higher category. The Mineral Resource estimates disclosed in this news release were reported using Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (the \"CIM Standards\") in accordance with National Instrument 43-101- Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects of the Canadian Securities Administrators (\"NI 43-101\").\nCautionary Statement to U.S. Readers\nThis news release uses the terms \"Mineral Resource\", \"Indicated Mineral Resource\" and \"Inferred Mineral Resource\" as defined in the CIM Standards in accordance with NI 43-101. While these terms are recognized and required by the Canadian Securities Administrators in accordance with Canadian securities laws, they may not be recognized by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe \"Mineral Resource\" estimates and related information in this news release may not be comparable to similar information made public by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements under the United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nSOURCE Nighthawk Gold Corp.\nView original content to download multimedia: http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/March2022/08/c4999.html",

This program is the foundation for a prospecting, bedrock mapping and sampling program being planned for the summer of 2022. The Company will design a fall core drill program to test any prospective mineral targets that may be defined from the geophysics, prospecting, bedrock mapping and sampling programs.\nAmber Showing Highlights:\nDiscovery of three gold- bearing shear zones interpreted to be potentially economic gold carriers due to their low resistivity, low magnetic signature, size potential and high conductivity (IP) usually characteristic of shear hosted gold deposits found elsewhere in the Chapais-Chibougamau gold camp (see Northern Superior press release, June 16, 2017; October 29, 2014; December 11th, 2014; May 3rd, 2016; March 9th, 2017). Gold associated with the southern shear zone is associated with strongly sheared silicified carbonatized gabbro, diorite quartz feldspar porphyry. Highlights for each shear zone include:\nSouth Trend (310\u00b0), consisting of the Amber Gold showing,\nBedrock grab sample, 28.6g/t Au.\nChannel sample, 10.0g/t Au over 1.0m including 26.1g/t Au over 0.5m.\nTrenching defines 290.0m strike, 20m wide, open along strike, both directions.\nCore drill intersection of 2.26g/t Au over 4.85m incl. 11.5g/t Au over 0.82m.\nCentral Trend, consisting of the Till-39 Gold Showing, aligned parallel to (310\u00b0), and 325m north of the South Trend,\nTill sample yielding 17 pristine gold grains.\nChannel sample, 2.89g/t Au over 1.0m.\nNorth Trend, consisting of the Till- 68 Gold Showing, aligned parallel to (310\u00b0), and 550m north of the South Trend,\nTill sample yielding 68 pristine gold grains.\nChannel sample, 2.44g/t Au over 0.85m.\nFigure 1. Location of the Amber area, Lac Surprise property.\nFigure 2. The 2022 IP and magnetometer survey (58 line kms) defined by the black grid. This grid shown in black is the eastern extension of the 2015 IP survey (27.35 line kms; red grid). The 2022 geophysical program, coupled with a prospecting, bedrock mapping and sampling program is designed to trace the southeastward extension of the three gold-bearing zones previously defined (see text for discussion).\nDr. T.F. Morris, President and CEO states:\"We are extremely pleased to once again have additional boots on the ground in this highly prospective southwest area of the property. With our recent success achieved at the Falcon Zone coupled with the IP survey flown last year over the Confluence Zone in the center of our property package we are focused on systematically advancing several other significant drill ready targets on our large Lac Surprise Property. These results from these geophysical surveys, coupled with results generated from our current core drill program focused on the newly discovered Falcon Gold Zone will advance our understanding of the gold potential over this large property.\"\nAbout the Lac Surprise Property: Falcon Gold Zone (FGZ)\nThe Company recently announced that it had initiated a 15-hole (6,650m) core drill program designed to further evaluate the newly discovered FGZ (see Northern Superior press release, February 8, 2022). The FGZ is a major, near-surface discovery made by Northern Superior over the past 20 months. This Gold Zone can be traced west over 900m from the eastern boundary of the property, on strike with Vanstar/ IAMGold's 3.2M ounces at 1.02 g/t Au Nelligan gold deposit* (see Figure 2, Northern Superior press release, August 17, 2021). The robust, lateral continuity of the FGZ is highlighted by a 100% drill hole strike rate (29 of 29 holes; see Northern Superior press release, March 10, 2022). Notable holes from the FGZ include: LCS21-029 (1.36g/t Au over 40.0m; 273.00-313.00m); LCS19-005ext (1.54g/t Au over 44.9m; 293.50-338.40m); LCS21-43 (1.10g/t Au over 43.0m; 95.00-138.00m); and LCS21-032 (1.99g/t Au over 42.6m; 107.40-150.00m) (Table 1, Figure 3; see Northern Superior press release, August 17, 2021).\nTo date, the FGZ has demonstrated robust lateral (900m; Figure 3), vertical (342m; Figure 4; see Northern Superior press release March 10, 2022) continuity and the potential for higher grade intervals with depth (see Northern Superior press release, February 8, 2022).\nAs such the objectives of this drill program are to: a) continue to expand FGZ strike extension to the west; b) vertically extend the currently defined FGZ; c) test for higher grade mineralization at depth; and d) determine if a parallel gold-bearing structure exists south of the FGZ.\nFigure 3. Highlighted drill intersections with gold values >1.0g/t Au, FGZ highlighting lateral continuity with remarkable consistency and predictability.\nFigure 4.

Here are a couple of low-cost stars on my watchlist today.\nRiding the electric car boom\nSurging tin prices have helped blast AfriTin Mining\u2019s (LSE: ATM) share price through the roof. The penny stock recently closed at record peaks of 7.8p per share but has sunk from these highs due to choppy metal prices. I think this could represent an attractive buying opportunity.\nAs its name suggests, the business is involved in producing tin in Africa (and more specifically Namibia). This is a commodity that could be set to soar in value as demand for consumer electronics and electric vehicles (EVs) takes off. The metal that AfriTin produces is being used increasingly as a soldering material instead of lead.\nBut the commodities producer is about more than just tin. AfriTin has spoken previously about adding tantalum and lithium to its product suite and this month announced it had found spodumene near its flagship Uis asset. The lithium-bearing mineral could significantly boost AfriTin\u2019s exposure to the booming EV market where it is used to make batteries.\nAfriTin has plenty of potential, then, but its shares don\u2019t exactly come cheap. The business trades on a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.3 times. It\u2019s the sort of premium rating that could prompt a sharp share price reversal if the company experiences trouble.\nHowever, this is a risk I could be willing to take given the excellent long-term potential for its metals.\nA safe-haven penny stock\nThe Covid-19 crisis and tragic events in Ukraine show that holding gold, gold-based financial instruments, or precious metal-producing stocks could be a good plan. History shows that bullion prices rise during social, economic, and political crises when riskier assets like shares sell off. So having a gold-based investment at all times can help protect one\u2019s portfolio.\nThis is why I think holding Shanta Gold (LSE: SHG) shares could be a good idea for me today. Buying this particular gold miner gives me the chance to receive dividends along with the benefit of riding the gold price. This is something that owning bars, coins, or a metal-backed financial instrument like an exchange-traded fund (or ETF) doesn\u2019t. Oh, and the yield at Shanta sits at a healthy 2.3% for this year.\nGold prices came within a whisker of reaching new highs last week as Russia intensified its operations in Ukraine. The conflict is ongoing and so fresh attempts could be around the corner in the coming days. Regardless, I think bullion will take out the current record above $2,070 per ounce as inflationary pressures accelerate. The Bank of England, for example, now says British consumer prices could rise more than 8% later this year.\nOwning mining shares like Shanta Gold means that investors burden themselves with the extra risk of production problems that could decimate profits. But it\u2019s my opinion that the potential long-term benefits of owning this particular Tanzania-focussed miner still make it a great buy for my portfolio right now.\nThe post 2 top penny stocks to buy right now appeared first on The Motley Fool UK.\nMore reading\nRoyston Wild has no position in any of the shares mentioned.

In addition, there are risks and hazards associated with the business of mineral exploration, development and mining, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected formations, pressures, cave-ins, flooding and gold bullion, copper cathode or gold or copper concentrate losses (and the risk of inadequate insurance, or inability to obtain insurance, to cover these risks). The Company also cautions that its 2022 guidance may be impacted by the unprecedented business and social disruption caused by the spread of Covid-19.\nMany of these uncertainties and contingencies can affect our actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, us. Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. All of the forward-looking statements made in this press release are qualified by these cautionary statements. Specific reference is made to the most recent Form 40-F/Annual Information Form on file with the SEC and Canadian provincial securities regulatory authorities for a more detailed discussion of some of the factors underlying forward-looking statements and the risks that may affect Barrick\u2019s ability to achieve the expectations set forth in the forward-looking statements contained in this press release.

Such factors include, without limitation: the Company's dependence on one mineral project; precious metals price volatility; risks associated with the conduct of the Company's mineral exploration activities in Guyana; regulatory, consent or permitting delays; risks relating to reliance on the Company's management team and outside contractors; risks regarding mineral resources and reserves; the Company's inability to obtain insurance to cover all risks, on a commercially reasonable basis or at all; currency fluctuations; risks regarding the failure to generate sufficient cash flow from operations; risks relating to project financing and equity issuances; risks and unknowns inherent in all mining projects, including the inaccuracy of reserves and resources, metallurgical recoveries and capital and operating costs of such projects; contests over title to properties, particularly title to undeveloped properties; laws and regulations governing the environment, health and safety; the ability of the communities in which the Company operates to manage and cope with the implications of COVID-19; the economic and financial implications of COVID-19 to the Company; operating or technical difficulties in connection with mining or development activities; employee relations, labour unrest or unavailability; the Company's interactions with surrounding communities and artisanal miners; the Company's ability to successfully integrate acquired assets; the speculative nature of exploration and development, including the risks of diminishing quantities or grades of reserves; stock market volatility; conflicts of interest among certain directors and officers; lack of liquidity for shareholders of the Company; litigation risk; and the factors identified in the Company's public disclosure documents available on www.sedar.com.

Just like the rest of us, gold speculators have been trying to interpret the ever-changing headlines about the conflict, which may be the key reason behind the sideways price action.\nThe recent $182.00 break in gold is a strong sign that the \u201cwar premium\u201d has been taken out of the market. Meanwhile, five days of sideways action suggests traders are waiting to see if the situation escalates or if it is dampened by a cease fire, or peace.\nWhat could be keeping the market underpinned are potentially bullish comments from Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy who warned that if peace talks with Russian leader Vladimir Putin fail, it would mean the start of a global war.\n\u201cIf these attempts fail, that would mean that this is a third world war,\u201d Zelenskyy said in an interview with CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria that aired Sunday morning. Ukrainian and Russian officials have met intermittently for peace talks, which have failed to progress to key concessions.\nFurthermore, U.S. President Joe Biden has said Russian leader Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cback is against the wall\u201d and he could resort to using more severe tactics in Ukraine.",

DPM evaluated the impact of this trend on the Mineral Reserves and LOM for Chelopech and conducted extensive metallurgical test work during the third quarter of 2021, which demonstrated the technical and commercial viability of producing a lower grade concentrate to meet market specifications. While the concentrate contains lower average gold and copper grades and is expected to have lower payable metal rates as well as increased offsite costs associated with higher tonnage, this is more than offset by improved overall gold recoveries and commercial terms, resulting in higher expected free cash flow for DPM as a whole.\nWhile this is expected to reduce the proportion of Chelopech concentrate that is treated at DPM\u2019s Tsumeb smelter, the Company is confident sufficient third-party concentrate is available to fill existing capacity going forward.\nThe Strategic Optimization also evaluated multiple mine schedules and commercial scenarios at various cut-off values, with the primary objectives of optimizing net present value (\u201cNPV\u201d) and mine life.\nFrom the analysis of cut-off values, it was determined that a NSR-less-costs cut-off value of $0 per tonne resulted in the maximum NPV, whereas the prior Mineral Reserve estimate used a NSR-less-costs cut-off value of $10 per tonne. Chelopech Mineral Reserves continue to be based on a NSR-less-costs cut-off value methodology using long-term metal prices of $1,400 per oz. for gold, $17 per oz. for silver, and $2.75 per lb. for copper.\nThree-Year Outlook\nThe updated Mineral Reserve estimate is in-line with the Company\u2019s previously issued 2021 guidance and three-year outlook for Chelopech, as shown below, with all-in sustaining cost (\u201cAISC\u201d) per ounce of gold sold for 2023 and 2024 expected to trend toward the lower end of the range as increased volumes of Chelopech concentrate are processed by third-party smelters.\n| 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | |\n| Metals contained in concentrate produced | ||||\n| Gold (K oz.) | 177 | 169 \u2013 191 | 150 \u2013 170 | 161 \u2013 182 |\n| Copper (Mlbs.) | 35 | 32 \u2013 37 | 32 \u2013 39 | 30 \u2013 35 |\n| Cost of sales per tonne of ore processed(1) | $59.48 | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| Cash cost per tonne of ore processed(1) | $47.12 | 48 \u2013 53 | N/A | N/A |\n| Cost of sales per ounce of gold sold(1) | $876 | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| AISC per ounce of gold sold(1) | $722 | 750 \u2013 890 | 630 \u2013 760 | 720 \u2013 850 |\n| Sustaining capital expenditures | $19.2 | 24 \u2013 27 | 20 \u2013 22 | 16 \u2013 17 |\n-\nCost of sales per tonne of ore processed and cost of sales per ounce of gold sold are supplementary financial measures, representing Chelopech cost of sales divided by the volume of ore processed and the payable gold in concentrate sold, respectively. Cash cost per tonne of ore processed and AISC per ounce of gold sold are Non-GAAP ratios. These cash cost and AISC measures have no standardized meanings under International Financial Reporting Standards (\u201cIFRS\u201d) and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Refer to the \u201cNon-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section contained in the Company\u2019s Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis (the \u201cMD&A\u201d) for the year ended December 31, 2021 commencing at page 55, which is available on the Company\u2019s website at www.dundeeprecious.com and has been filed on the SEDAR site at www.sedar.com, for a detailed description, and in the case of historical measures, a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable measure under IFRS.\nFor more information regarding the Company\u2019s 2022 guidance and three-year outlook, including key assumptions, qualifications and risks associated thereto, refer to the MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2021, issued on February 17, 2022, available on the Company\u2019s website at www.dundeeprecious.com and on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.\nFurther extending mine life through additional in-mine and brownfield exploration\nDPM continues to focus on extending Chelopech\u2019s mine life through its successful in-mine exploration program and a growing brownfield exploration program, which for 2022 includes:\n-\nApproximately 44,000 metres of in-mine drilling for Mineral Resource development; and\n-\nApproximately 50,000 metres of brownfield exploration, primarily concentrated on near mine exploration drilling related to the Sveta Petka commercial discovery application, as well as drilling at Sharlo Dere and other near-mine targets in the mining concession area.\nThe Company\u2019s application for a one-year extension to the Sveta Petka exploration licence, which surrounds the Chelopech mine, was approved in November 2021, allowing DPM to commence work related to the commercial discovery phase.

The reader has been cautioned that the foregoing list is not exhaustive of all factors which may have been used. Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in Forward Looking Statements, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to be anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that Forward Looking Statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. The Company\u2019s Forward Looking Statements reflect current expectations regarding future events and speak only as of the date hereof. Unless required by securities laws, the Company undertakes no obligation to update Forward Looking Statements if circumstances or management\u2019s estimates or opinions should change. Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on Forward Looking Statements.\nCautionary Note to United States Investors Concerning Estimates of Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources\nThe Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates presented in this news release have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Canadian securities laws, which differ from the requirements of United States securities laws. Canadian reporting requirements for disclosure of mineral properties are governed by NI 43-101.\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) adopted amendments to its disclosure rules to modernize the mineral property disclosure requirements for issuers whose securities are registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These amendments became effective February 25, 2019 (the \u201cSEC Modernization Rules\u201d) with compliance required for the first fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2021. The SEC Modernization Rules replace the historical disclosure requirements for mining issuers that were included in SEC Industry Guide 7. As a result of the adoption of the SEC Modernization Rules, the SEC now recognizes estimates of \u201cmeasured mineral resources\u201d, \u201cindicated mineral resources\u201d and \u201cinferred mineral resources\u201d. In addition, the SEC has amended its definitions of \u201cproven mineral reserves\u201d and \u201cprobable mineral reserves\u201d to be \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to the corresponding Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (\u201cCIM\u201d) \u2013 Definition Standards adopted by CIM Council on May 10, 2014 (the \u201cCIM Definition Standards\u201d), incorporated by reference in NI 43-101.\nReaders are cautioned that while the above terms are \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to the corresponding CIM Definition Standards, there are differences in the definitions under the SEC Modernization Rules and the CIM Definition Standards. Accordingly, there is no assurance any Mineral Reserves or Mineral Resources that the Company may report as \u201cproven mineral reserves\u201d, \u201cprobable mineral reserves\u201d, \u201cmeasured mineral resources\u201d, \u201cindicated mineral resources\u201d and \u201cinferred mineral resources\u201d under NI 43-101 would be the same had the Company prepared the reserve or resource estimates under the standards adopted under the SEC Modernization Rules.\nReaders are also cautioned that while the SEC will now recognize \u201cmeasured mineral resources\u201d, \u201cindicated mineral resources\u201d and \u201cinferred mineral resources\u201d, it should not be assumed that any part or all of the mineralization in these categories will ever be converted into a higher category of Mineral Resources or into Mineral Reserves. Mineralization described using these terms has a greater amount of uncertainty as to their existence and feasibility than mineralization that has been characterized as reserves. Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to assume that any \u201cmeasured mineral resources\u201d, \u201cindicated mineral resources\u201d or \u201cinferred mineral resources\u201d that the Company reports are or will be economically or legally mineable. Further, \u201cinferred mineral resources\u201d have a greater amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined legally or economically. Therefore, readers are also cautioned not to assume that all or any part of the \u201cinferred mineral resources\u201d exist. In accordance with Canadian securities laws, estimates of \u201cinferred mineral resources\u201d cannot form the basis of feasibility or other economic studies, except in limited circumstances where permitted under NI 43-101.\nFor the above reasons, information contained in this news release containing descriptions of the Company\u2019s mineral deposits may not be comparable to similar information made public by United States companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements under the United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.",

The new NCIB also provides Sandstorm with the option to purchase its Common Shares from time to time when Sandstorm's management believes that the Common Shares are undervalued by the market. The Toronto Stock Exchange (\"TSX\") has accepted the Company's notice that it intends to proceed with a NCIB in accordance with TSX rules. Purchases under the renewed NCIB may commence on April 7, 2022 and will terminate on the earlier of April 6, 2023, the date that Sandstorm completes its purchases pursuant to the NCIB as filed with the TSX, or the date of notice by Sandstorm of termination of the NCIB.\nAll purchases under the NCIB will be executed on the open market through the facilities of the TSX or alternative Canadian trading platforms and through the facilities of the NYSE or alternative trading platforms in the United States of America. Purchases will be made at the market price of the Common Shares at the time of acquisition and may be funded by Sandstorm's working capital. Any Common Shares acquired by the Company under the NCIB will be cancelled. Sandstorm's average daily trading volume on the TSX during the last six calendar months was 270,139 Common Shares. Under the rules of the TSX, subject to the Company's ability to make block purchases, daily purchases on the TSX under the NCIB will not exceed 67,534 Common Shares, which represents 25% of the average daily trading volume on the TSX during the last six calendar months. The maximum number of Common Shares which can be purchased per day on the NYSE will be 25% of the average daily trading volume for the four calendar weeks preceding the date of purchase, subject to certain exceptions for block purchases.\nThe actual number of Common Shares that may be purchased and the timing of such purchases will be determined by the Company. Decisions regarding purchases will be based on market conditions, share price, best use of available cash, and other factors.\nIn the last twelve months, the Company has purchased 4,651,049 Common Shares pursuant to its NCIB at a weighted average price of approximately C$7.95 per common share on the TSX and alternates and approximately US$6.19 per common share on the NYSE and alternates.\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities in the United States, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nFor more information about Sandstorm Gold Royalties, please visit our website at www.sandstormgold.com or email us at info@sandstormgold.com.\nABOUT SANDSTORM GOLD ROYALTIES\nSandstorm is a gold royalty company that provides upfront financing to gold mining companies that are looking for capital and in return, receives the right to a percentage of the gold produced from a mine, for the life of the mine. Sandstorm has acquired a portfolio of 230 royalties, of which 29 of the underlying mines are producing. Sandstorm plans to grow and diversify its low cost production profile through the acquisition of additional gold royalties.

These standards differ significantly from the mineral reserve disclosure requirements of the United States Securities Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") set forth in Industry Guide 7. Consequently, information regarding mineralization contained or referenced herein is not comparable to similar information that would generally be disclosed by U.S. companies under Industry Guide 7 in accordance with the rules of the SEC. Further, the SEC has adopted amendments to its disclosure rules to modernize the mineral property disclosure requirements for issuers whose securities are registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\"Exchange Act\"). These amendments became effective February 25, 2019 (the \"SEC Modernization Rules\") and, commencing for registrants with their first fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2021, the SEC Modernization Rules replaced the historical property disclosure requirements included in SEC Industry Guide 7. As a foreign private issuer that files its annual report on Form 40-F with the SEC pursuant to the multi-jurisdictional disclosure system, the Company is not required to provide disclosure on its mineral properties under the SEC Modernization Rules and will continue to provide disclosure under NI 43-101 and the CIM Definition Standards. The SEC Modernization Rules include the adoption of terms describing mineral reserves and mineral resources that are \"substantially similar\" to the corresponding terms under the CIM Definition, but there are differences in the definitions under the SEC Modernization Rules and the CIM Definition Standards. Accordingly, there is no assurance any mineral reserves or mineral resources that the Company may report as \"proven mineral reserves\", \"probable mineral reserves\", \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources\" under NI 43-101 would be the same had the Company prepared the mineral reserve or mineral resource estimates under the standards adopted under the SEC Modernization Rules. U.S. investors are also cautioned that while the SEC recognizes \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources\" under the Modernization Rules, investors should not assume that any part or all of the mineralization in these categories will ever be converted into a higher category of mineral resources or into mineral reserves. Mineralization described using these terms has a greater amount of uncertainty as to its existence and feasibility than mineralization that has been characterized as reserves. Accordingly, investors are cautioned not to assume that any measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources, or inferred mineral resources that the Company reports are or will be economically or legally mineable. Further, \"inferred mineral resources\" have a greater amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined legally or economically. Therefore, U.S. investors are also cautioned not to assume that all or any part of the \"inferred mineral resources\" exist. Under Canadian securities laws, estimates of \"inferred mineral resources\" may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases. For the above reasons, information contained or referenced herein regarding descriptions of our mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates is not comparable to similar information made public by U.S. companies subject to reporting and disclosure requirements of the SEC under either Industry Guide 7 or SEC Modernization Rules.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\", within the meaning of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation, concerning the business, operations and financial performance and condition of Sandstorm Gold Royalties. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to the future price of gold, silver, copper, iron ore and other metals, statements with respect to Sandstorm's proposed NCIB and the number of Common Shares that may be purchased under the NCIB; the estimation of mineral reserves and resources, realization of mineral reserve estimates, the timing and amount of estimated future production. Forward-looking statements can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \"may\", \"will\", \"expect\", \"intend\", \"estimate\", \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"continue\", \"plans\", or similar terminology.\nForward-looking statements are made based upon certain assumptions and other important factors that, if untrue, could cause the actual results, performances or achievements of Sandstorm Gold Royalties to be materially different from future results, performances or achievements expressed or implied by such statements. Such statements and information are based on numerous assumptions regarding present and future business strategies and the environment in which Sandstorm Gold Royalties will operate in the future, including the receipt of all required approvals, the price of gold and copper and anticipated costs. Certain important factors that could cause actual results, performances or achievements to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, amongst others, failure to receive necessary approvals, changes in business plans and strategies, market conditions, share price, best use of available cash, gold and other commodity price volatility, discrepancies between actual and estimated production, mineral reserves and resources and metallurgical recoveries, mining operational and development risks relating to the parties which produce the gold or other commodity the Company will purchase, regulatory restrictions, activities by governmental authorities (including changes in taxation), currency fluctuations, the global economic climate, dilution, share price volatility and competition.\nForward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause the actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, including but not limited to: the impact of general business and economic conditions, the absence of control over mining operations from which the Company will purchase gold, other commodities or receive royalties from, and risks related to those mining operations, including risks related to international operations, government and environmental regulation, actual results of current exploration activities, conclusions of economic evaluations and changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined, risks in the marketability of minerals, fluctuations in the price of gold and other commodities, fluctuation in foreign exchange rates and interest rates, stock market volatility, as well as those factors discussed in the section entitled \"Risks to Sandstorm\" in the Company's annual report for the financial year ended December 31, 2021 and the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" contained in the Company's annual information form dated March 31, 2022 available at www.sedar.com. Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that are contained or incorporated by reference, except in accordance with applicable securities laws.\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sandstorm-gold-royalties-renews-normal-course-issuer-bid-301517328.html\nSOURCE Sandstorm Gold Ltd.\nView original content to download multimedia: http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/April2022/05/c4208.html",

(NYSE:NEM) is one of the worlds largest gold producers with operations and assets in the U.S, Canada, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Peru, Suriname, Argentina, Chile, Australia and Ghana.

Physical gold as well as gold mining equities are often seen as a primary hedge against inflation.\nGold is still considered a rare element and a precious metal that has been used for currency, jewelry and other industrial uses for thousands of years. The gold standard was often utilized in monetary policy in the U.S. and other countries off and on since the 1870s, but in 1971, this concept was abandoned for a fiat or paper currency that stands today.\nGold prices rose to over $2,000 per ounce in August 2020 due to government stimulus that was ramped up to fight the negative effects of the Covid pandemic. The price eventually retreated to below $1,700 as the first wave of the pandemic faded away, only to be followed by rampant inflation and global military conflict. This spiked gold prices to over $2,000 again, and they have recently settled in the $1,900s range.\nCryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin were once thought to be an inflation hedge and perhaps a substitute for gold, but that concept has not come to fruition in any meaningful way.\nFinancial review\nNewmont reported strong 2021 financial results as most commodity prices remained elevated. Revenues increased 6.3% to $12.2 billion. Gold sales represented 86% of total revenues with silver, zinc, copper and lead making up the rest in that order. Averaged realized gold prices in 2021 were $1,798 compared to $1,852 in 20202.\nNet income increased 10.8% and Ebitda increased 7.7%. Free cash flow has been strong in recent years, totaling $2.6 billion in 2021 and $3.5 billion in 2020. Mining is a capital-intensive business and the company has spent an average of $1.5 billion in capital expenditures annually over the past three years.\nThis is also a dangerous line of business, and one of Newmonts most important metrics involves the companys fatality risk management program. The company continues to implement over 500,000 in-field critical control verifications with a large proportion via new mobile applications. Although some serious incidents have incurred in recent years, mitigation controls have been somewhat successful recently.\nBalance sheet and flexibility\nNewmonts balance sheet is in good shape with liquidity of $8.0 billion, cash and equivalents of $5.0 billion and total debt of $5.6 billion. There are no debt maturities until 2029 and the debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 0.2. Cash returned to shareholders for 2021 totaled $2.3 billion, which was comprised of dividend payments of $1.8 billion and share buybacks of $525 million.\nValuation\nThe company continues to develop a mining and financial plan where profitability can be achieved even at a $1,200 spot gold price. However, due to inflation, higher royalties, labor costs and increased production taxes, the company assumes an $1,800 gold price for its 2022 outlook.\nBased on these assumptions, analysts are calling for steady Ebitda in the $7 billion range over the next three years and steady free cash flow of approximately $3 billion on an annual basis.\nNewmont maintains a unique dividend framework in which they pay a declared continual base dividend and then supplement it with an additional dividend payment based on free cash flows derived from the level of gold prices. The sustainable dividend is currently paying $1.00 and then the excess target is 50% of attributable cash flow above a $1,200 gold price. That resulted in a $1.20 excess payment for a total declared dividend last year of $2.20, which equates to a dividend yield of 2.26%. The company stated that at a $2,100 gold price, the total dividend payout could be $3.25 at mid-point, which would be a 4.0% dividend yield and significantly above market and industry averages.\nGuru trades\nOne guru who recently added to his Newmont holding is John Hussman (Trades, Portfolio). Gurus who have reduced or sold out of the stock recently include Jim Simons (Trades, Portfolio), Mario Gabelli (Trades, Portfolio) and Joel Greenblatt (Trades, Portfolio).\nConclusion\nBuying gold and gold mining stocks as an inflation hedge is a great theme, but Newmont currently produces high levels of free cash flow and high returns on capital, so perhaps it has become a real industrial company if we can assume gold and other commodity prices dont round trip to below $1,200 per ounce.\nAlthough Newmont is selling near 52-week highs, the stock likely has upside potential from here as inflation will not likely be tamed by near-term monetary policy actions. If the Federal Reserve raises interest rates above current expectations, I believe they could likely trigger a substantial market decline driven by investor sentiment. That will perhaps benefit gold related securities as a safe haven opportunity.\nLastly, the above-market dividend yield should provide some stability as it attracts more income oriented investors as compared to those investors interested in commodity plays.\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

The high-grade gold values and the fact that gold mineralization exists in a variety of geological settings and orientations demonstrates the prospectivity of the property and our contiguous Goldarm Property.\u201d\nThe Aljo Mine was the focus of underground exploration and development during the early 1900\u2019s, including two shafts to depths of 400 and 575 feet. Limited, intermittent production occurred through the 1940\u2019s. More recently, Kingswood Exploration completed surface exploration and drilling on the property between 1988 and 1992. This historic drilling returned high-grade gold mineralization associated with quartz-carbonate veins in highly carbonate-altered mafic volcanic rocks (See Table 1). Gold mineralization is also documented in the adjacent ultramafic and porphyric felsic intrusive rocks which, along with the presence of extensional- and shear-vein systems, provides support for multiple mineralized zones and the overall high prospectivity of the area.\nTable 1: Highlights from Historic Drill Intercepts on the Coulson Claims (1)\nHole ID\nFrom (m)\nTo (m)\nInterval (m)\nAu g/t\nDC822\n74.68\n76.20\n1.52\n15.40\n85.92\n86.87\n0.94\n10.92\nK-2-88\n151.49\n153.31\n1.83\n14.34\nBC-90-4\n19.20\n21.03\n1.83\n82.60\nBC-90-5\n78.64\n80.16\n1.52\n11.20\nBC-90-6\n58.83\n59.44\n0.61\n83.44\nBC-92-12\n72.24\n74.07\n1.83\n9.24\n76.60\n76.99\n0.40\n72.24\nBC-92-21\n102.78\n106.07\n3.29\n5.46\n(1) Drill intercepts are historical and GFG\u2019s QP has not verified the laboratory accreditation, analytical method, sample size or QA/QC procedures utilized for the historic drill results. True widths have not been estimated.\nPotential quantity and grade is conceptual in nature. There has been insufficient exploration to define a Mineral Resource on the Coulson Claims to date and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the Coulson Claims being defined as a Mineral Resource.\nTerms of the Agreement Under the terms of the Agreement, GFG will acquire a 100% interest in the Coulson Claims by:\nIssuing 700,000 common shares of GFG (\u201cConsideration Shares\u201d) on closing of the Agreement;\nMaking a cash payment of C$50,000 to the Vendors;\nGranting the Vendors a 2% NSR on the Coulson Claims with the right to buy-back one half (1%) of the NSR for C$1,000,000; and\nMaking a success payment of C$1.0 million in cash within 60 days of announcement of any NI 43-101 compliant mineral resource of 1.0 million ounce of gold on the Coulson Claims.\nCompletion of the Agreement is subject to certain customary closing conditions, including approval of the TSX Venture Exchange. The Consideration Shares will be subject to a customary four month hold period.\nOutlook In 2022, the Company plans to complete approximately 10,000 m of drilling on its Timmins portfolio with its 4,000 m Phase 1 drill program well underway at the Montclerg Gold Project. In addition to the 2022 drill programs, GFG will continue additional regional exploration activities and drill target development across the Goldarm Property and the Pen Gold Project. The regional programs will include airborne geophysics, sonic till sampling programs and data compilation. Meanwhile, assay results are pending for the remaining five holes from the maiden 2021 drill program and the Company expects to report these results in the coming weeks.\nFollowing the successful initial test work that exceeded recovery rate expectations at the Rattlesnake Hills Gold Project (\u201cRSH Project\u201d) (See news release dated March 15, 2022), the Company\u2019s option partner, Group 11 Technologies Inc. (\u201cGroup 11\u201d), will proceed to conduct further in-situ recovery analyses and data review. The technical review will further assess the amenability and recovery rates for extracting gold using an eco-friendly water-based solution. Next steps to advance the RSH Project to include additional laboratory tests, additional drill tests and related project permitting.\nAbout GFG Resources Inc. GFG is a North American precious metals exploration company focused on district scale gold projects in tier one mining jurisdictions, Ontario and Wyoming. In Ontario, the Company operates three gold projects, each large and highly prospective gold properties within the prolific gold district of Timmins, Ontario, Canada.

(\u201cNovo\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSX: NVO, NVO.WT & NVO.WT.A) (OTCQX: NSRPF) provides a Q1 2022 operational update from Beatons Creek, located in Nullagine, Western Australia.\n\u201cThis quarter has seen a positive increase in production, revenue and more importantly, consistent gold delivery from the Oxide mine areas,\u201d commented Mr. Mike Spreadborough, Executive Co-Chairman of Novo. \u201cWe expect this performance to continue in the second quarter of 2022, thus confirming the influence of closely-spaced grade control drilling on ongoing grade estimation and mine planning. Also of equal importance, is the demonstrated high-grade from the Grant\u2019s Hill Fresh material that has been mined to further confirm resource and metallurgical properties. We look forward to releasing the results of our updated Oxide mine plan and progress on the Fresh resource drilling and feasibility study in May 2022.\u201d\nBEATONS CREEK PROJECT\nSafety and COVID-19 Update\nSafety remains a core value of Novo.\nDuring Q1 2022, Novo did not record any lost time injuries.\nThe Company is experiencing impacts from COVID-19, particularly with respect to its workforce. Turnover rates are high and mandatory isolation for positive personnel and close contacts is temporarily impacting staffing levels for the Company and its contractors. Supply chain issues are resulting in moderately elevated production costs, particularly with respect to fuel and other consumables, however best efforts have been made to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic through the adoption of sound risk management processes. It is not possible at this time to predict the impact, if any, that current and future government policies and mandates may have on the Company\u2019s operations.\nOperations\nForecast Q1 2022 mining rates at Beatons Creek were achieved, with 396 kt of mineralized material mined from the Edwards, Gold Crown, and Grant\u2019s Hill areas of Beatons Creek (refer to Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3 below).\nGrade control drilling of Oxide material at Beatons Creek has continued, with 5,640 m on either a 10 x 10 m or 20 x 20 m pattern as appropriate to support the current forecast mining plan. The balance of the Oxide mining plan is now covered with 20 x 20 m drilling as a minimum, with ongoing drilling planned to tighten the drill spacing to 10 x 10 m and resource confidence ahead of mining operations. Samples generated from this drilling are delivered to Intertek\u2019s on-site laboratory for sample preparation ahead of despatch to Intertek\u2019s Perth facility4. Novo has secured priority access to two Chrysos PhotonAssay units4, enabling accurate and non-destructive gold assay results with very rapid turnaround time, furnishing operations with gold assay data in a timely manner to support mining operations.\nThe Company\u2019s Golden Eagle processing facility (\u201cGolden Eagle Plant\u201d) processed 394 kt in Q1 2022, with an average head grade of 1.15 g/t Au.\nGold production totalled 13,378 ounces and recovery rates of approximately 91.4% were achieved in Q1 2022.\nData from ongoing grade control drilling efforts is being used to update and expand Oxide mining schedules at Beatons Creek. Learnings from mining and grade reconciliation over the past year are being incorporated into all mine planning activities and are expected to result in more predictable future mine planning and scheduling models. The Company anticipates that results from this work will be released in May 2022.\nEncouragingly, head grade in March lifted to 1.31 g/t Au, supported by treating a 60 kt parcel of Fresh material from the Grant\u2019s Hill pit, which reconciled at 1.75 g/t Au. Throughput rates, reagent consumption and recoveries for this Fresh material performed to expectations and were not materially different to that experienced to date when processing Oxide material.\nThe Company\u2019s production forecast for the first half of 2022 has been revised to 27 koz \u2013 30 koz Au, assuming receipt of requisite approvals1 and ability to manage impact to operations from COVID-19.\nNovo Financial Position\nNovo maintains a strong a financial position, with a cash balance of C$22.0 million2 and investment portfolio with a fair value of approximately C$135 million3.\nQ1 2022 gold sales totalled 13,364 ounces of gold and 1,780 ounces of silver for gross revenue of C$31.9 million (A$34.7 million)2. Novo sells its gold in Australian dollars to ABC Refinery of Sydney, Australia and continues to enjoy strong gold price performance in Australian dollar terms.\nIn addition to its cash reserves, the Company\u2019s strategic portfolio of investments held a fair value of approximately C$135 million3 as at March 31, 2022, including its 9.1% investment in New Found Gold Corp. (TSXV: NFG) which was worth approximately C$114 million3 (approximately C$110 million as at the date of this news release).\nQP STATEMENT\nDr. Quinton Hennigh (P.Geo.) is the qualified person, as defined under National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, responsible for, and having reviewed and approved, the technical information contained in this news release. Dr. Hennigh is the non-executive co-chairman and a director of Novo.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT\nThe decision by the Company to produce at Beatons Creek was not based on a feasibility study of mineral reserves demonstrating economic and technical viability and, as a result, there is an increased uncertainty of achieving any particular level of recovery of minerals or the cost of such recovery, including increased risks associated with developing a commercially mineable deposit. Production has not achieved forecast to date. Historically, such projects have a much higher risk of economic and technical failure. There is no guarantee that anticipated production costs will be achieved. Failure to achieve the anticipated production costs would have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s cash flow and future profitability.\nThe Company cautions that its declaration of commercial production effective October 1, 20215 only indicates that Beatons Creek was operating at anticipated and sustainable levels and it does not indicate that economic results will be realized.\nABOUT NOVO\nNovo operates its flagship Beatons Creek Project while exploring and developing its prospective land package covering approximately 12,500 square kilometres in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. In addition to the Company\u2019s primary focus, Novo seeks to leverage its internal geological expertise to deliver value-accretive opportunities to its shareholders.

From surface to a depth of 448.7 metres, the drill hole cut altered and locally mineralized volcanic tuffs which are intruded by hydrothermal breccias. At 448.7 metres, the hole entered a sequence of altered rock mill breccia and crystal tuffs with disseminated pyrite partially replaced by covellite and chalcocite. Chalcopyrite and locally bornite are the prevalent copper bearing minerals below 1,089.8 metres. At 1,368.6 metres, the hole entered a moderately magnetic VP2 porphyry with dominant potassic alteration and disseminated chalcopyrite and pyrite.\nDrill hole ATXD-19 was collared 200 metres northeast of VALDD13-14. Due to operational issues, the hole has been stopped at a depth of 1,308.9 metres. ATXD-19 started in a sequence of altered tuffs and rock mill breccia before entering a long interval of crystal tuffs with disseminated pyrite partially replaced by chalcocite and covellite at 282.7 metres extending to 762.0 metres. Below 762.0 metres, altered rock mill breccia and crystal tuffs with disseminated chalcopyrite, locally cut by A-vein stockworks with chalcopyrite and pyrite, continue to a depth of 1,014.3 metres. At 1,014.3 metres, a transition zone of potassic altered VP2 porphyry and rock mill breccia with disseminated chalcopyrite continues until 1,157.8 metres where the hole entered potassic altered rock mill breccia, crystal tuffs and andesites with disseminated chalcopyrite, pyrite and bornite extending to the end of the hole.\n\"To-date, drill holes ATXD-17 and 19 have cut sequences of altered volcanic tuffs and rock mill breccia with localized porphyry and disseminated sulphides similar to what was observed in drill hole VALDD13-14,\" noted Raymond Jannas, President and CEO of ATEX. \"Both drill holes have been successful in expanding the footprint of the Valeriano porphyry system in a northeast southwest direction. ATXD-17 is progressing well and scheduled to be completed during the next few weeks. ATXD-19 was, unfortunately, halted short of its target depth; however, the observed core is encouraging. The goal is to have all assays available within 2 months after the completion of the drill program, subject to assay laboratory availability.\"\nNote: Until core samples assay from drill holes ATXD-17 and ATXD-19 are completed and received, any inference of potential copper and gold grades from the geological descriptions provided in this release is speculative in nature. Grades can only be determined upon receipt of assays.\nA third drill rig mobilized to the property in early March started drilling ATXD-20, which was collared 200 metres southwest of ATXD-17. This drill hole was lost due to operational issues at a depth of 443.8 metres after cutting through the upper sequence of crystal tuffs and volcanoclastics.\nThe Valeriano copper gold deposit hosts an inferred resource of 297.3 million tonnes grading 0.59% copper, 0.193 grams per tonne gold and 0.90 grams per tonne silver (0.77% copper equivalent) at a cut-off grade of 0.50% copper. Contained metals total 1.77 million tonnes copper, 1.84 million ounces gold and 8.62 million ounces silver for 2.30 million tonnes copper equivalent. For further information on the inferred resource estimate, see the Technical Report titled, \"VALERIANO PROJECT INFERRED RESOURCE ESTIMATES Atacama Region, Chile,\" dated November 13, 2020 and filed at www.sedar.com.\nNational Instrument 43-101 Compliance\nThe Qualified Person, as defined by National Instrument 43-101 (\"NI43-101\") of the Canadian Securities Administrators, for the Valeriano Copper Gold Project is Sergio Diaz, a resident of La Senera, Chile. Mr. Diaz is independent of ATEX as defined by NI43-101, is a Public Registered Person for Reserves and Resources No. 51 in Chile and is registered in the Colegio de Ge\u00f3logos de Chile under No. 315.\nThe resource estimate copper equivalent grade was calculated based upon a copper price of $3.00 per pound, gold price of $1,800 per ounce and silver price of $25.00 per ounces (all prices in US$). Metal recoveries were not considered. The formula used for the copper equivalent calculation was: Cu Eq% = (Cu ppm/10,000) + (Au g/t * Au $/oz/ 22.0462 * 31.1035*Cu price) + (Ag g/t * Ag price / 22.0462 * 31.1035*Cu price)\nAbout ATEX Resources Inc.\nATEX is a mineral exploration company focused on the acquisition, development and monetization of projects throughout the Americas.

(TSX: LGD; OTCQX: LGDTF) (\u201cLiberty Gold\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) is pleased to announce the first tranche of reverse circulation (\u201cRC\u201d) drill results from the 2022 winter program in the Rangefront Focus Area (\u201cRFA\u201d) at the Black Pine oxide gold deposit in southern Idaho (\u201cBlack Pine\u201d). The winter program in the RFA focused on both step-out and resource definition drilling. An additional 23 RFA drill holes are pending.\nToday\u2019s drill results further define and expand the higher-grade core zone within the RFA to an area of approximately 500 meters (\u201cm\u201d) by 1 kilometer (\u201ckm\u201d) with high-grade drill intercepts ranging from 20 to 115 m in length. The mineralization trends shallower as drilling expands the footprint east toward the current Rangefront resource pits and to the north towards the historic heap leach pad. The lower-grade mineralized envelope surrounding the high-grade core is also closer to surface. This should have a positive impact on strip ratio in a future mining scenario.\nResource definition drilling exceeded expectations in delivering additional high-grade oxide gold intercepts at shallow depths and confirmed multiple zones of greater than 100 m intercepts of continuous mineralization. Today\u2019s results from step-out drilling suggest that gold mineralization is open to the north and west. Results are pending from step-out drilling to the northeast. Additionally, shallow historic drilling indicates that mineralization is open to the east, where an expansion to the Plan of Operations is underway to facilitate access for drilling later in the year.\nCal Everett, President and CEO for Liberty Gold stated, \u201cFavourable weather conditions and a mild winter season at Black Pine led to an efficient drill campaign through the early part of the year, with 12,400 m drilled in 42 holes in the RFA in January and February. Drill results continue to encounter multiple thick intercepts of oxide gold in virtually every hole as we increase our confidence and extend the size of this new discovery. RFA mineralization also continues to migrate closer to surface as the high-grade core zone extends to the east and to the north. On completion of the recent C$30M financing, Liberty has a strong treasury to support our exploration and development efforts on both Black Pine and Goldstrike. Four drills are currently operating split between the two deposits.\u201d\nWinter drilling in the RFA focused on resource definition in the central part of the zone and step-out drilling, particularly to the northwest and northeast.\nDrill results exceeded expectations in delivering additional high-grade oxide gold intercepts at relatively shallow depths and multiple +100 m intercepts of continuous mineralization.\nThe core zone within the RFA now encompasses an area of approximately 500 m x 1 km.\nThe core zone has been extended to the east, as evidenced by LBP554 which delivered a long interval of high-grade gold mineralization starting from a projected depth of 80 m.\nLBP565 continued to expand the core zone to the north towards the historic heap leach pad, with mineralization starting at a projected depth of 40 m.\nLBP539 (18.3 m grading 1.53 grams per tonne gold (\u201cg/t Au\u201d)) and LBP557 (16.8 m grading 1.34 g/t Au) extend high-grade mineralization in a north-westerly direction, with mineralization open to the west and northwest\nResults are pending in a north-easterly direction. An amendment to the Plan of Operations is pending to allow further access in this direction, as well as along the eastern edge of the RFA where historic shallow drill holes bottom in mineralization.\nAssay results for a further 23 holes within the RFA drilled in Q1-2022 are pending.\nDrilling continues at Black Pine with 2 drills currently focused on a new area between the historic Tallman and CD pits.\nRANGEFRONT FOCUS AREA HIGHLIGHT TABLE1\nHole ID (Az, Dip) (degrees)\nFrom (m)\nTo (m)\nIntercept (m)\nAu (g/t)\nCut-off Au (g/t)\nHole Length (m)\nTarget\nComments\nLBP531A (0, -55)\n161.5\n179.8\n18.3\n0.24\n0.15\n335.3\nRangefront\nResource Definition\nincluding\n164.6\n176.8\n12.2\n0.28\n0.20\nand\n187.5\n211.8\n24.4\n0.28\n0.15\nincluding\n193.5\n208.8\n15.2\n0.34\n0.20\nand\n224.0\n248.4\n24.4\n0.55\n0.15\nincluding\n224.0\n242.3\n18.3\n0.68\n0.20\nand including\n224.0\n228.6\n4.6\n1.39\n1.00\nLBP532 (270, -50)\n167.6\n185.9\n18.3\n0.20\n0.15\n306.3\nRangefront\nResource Definition\nand\n227.1\n257.6\n30.5\n0.66\n0.15\nincluding\n228.6\n249.9\n21.3\n0.86\n0.20\nand including\n240.8\n246.9\n6.1\n2.06\n1.00\nLBP536 (180, -70)\n83.8\n94.5\n10.7\n0.35\n0.15\n300.2\nRangefront Central\nResource Definition\nand\n102.1\n111.3\n9.1\n0.38\nand\n190.5\n217.9\n27.4\n0.65\nincluding\n190.5\n202.7\n12.2\n0.94\n0.20\nand including\n190.5\n199.6\n9.1\n1.15\n1.00\nincluding\n208.8\n216.4\n7.6\n0.69\n0.20\nand including\n211.8\n213.4\n1.5\n1.12\n1.00\nand\n251.5\n266.7\n15.2\n0.39\n0.15\nLBP539 (310, -50)\n217.9\n257.6\n39.6\n0.28\n0.15\n385.6\nRangefront Central\nStep-Out\nincluding\n228.6\n257.6\n29.0\n0.33\n0.20\nand\n326.1\n344.4\n18.3\n1.53\n0.20\nincluding\n327.7\n339.9\n12.2\n2.06\n1.00\nHole ID (Az, Dip) (degrees)\nFrom (m)\nTo (m)\nIntercept (m)\nAu (g/t)\nCut-off Au (g/t)\nHole Length (m)\nTarget\nComments\nLBP540 (315, -55)\n83.8\n109.7\n25.9\n0.21\n0.15\n336.8\nRangefront North\nResource Definition\nand\n150.9\n169.2\n18.3\n0.23\n0.15\nand\n187.5\n292.6\n105.2\n0.38\n0.15\nincluding\n205.7\n266.7\n61.0\n0.51\n0.20\nand including\n239.3\n246.9\n7.6\n1.18\n1.00\nLBP543 (340, -90)\n68.6\n80.8\n12.2\n0.29\n0.15\n396.2\nRangefront Central\nResource Definition\nincluding\n74.7\n80.8\n6.1\n0.39\n0.20\nand\n150.9\n192.0\n41.1\n0.30\n0.15\nincluding\n161.5\n189.0\n27.4\n0.36\n0.20\nand\n263.7\n288.0\n24.4\n0.56\n0.15\nincluding\n263.7\n283.5\n19.8\n0.65\n0.20\nand including\n265.2\n269.7\n4.6\n1.71\n1.00\nLBP551 (50, -80)\n149.4\n201.2\n51.8\n0.25\n0.15\n361.2\nRangefront Central\nResource Definition\nand\n228.6\n243.8\n15.2\n0.39\n0.15\nand\n278.9\n292.6\n13.7\n0.25\n0.15\nLBP552 (0, -80)\n39.6\n57.9\n18.3\n0.25\n0.15\n300.2\nRangefront Central\nResource Definition\nand\n91.4\n96.0\n4.6\n0.46\n0.20\nand\n111.3\n115.8\n4.6\n0.52\n0.15\nincluding\n111.3\n114.3\n3.0\n0.70\n0.20\nand\n129.5\n137.2\n7.6\n0.34\n0.15\nincluding\n129.5\n132.6\n3.0\n0.57\n0.20\nand\n161.5\n198.1\n36.6\n0.30\nand\n237.7\n248.4\n10.7\n0.49\n0.15\nincluding\n239.3\n246.9\n7.6\n0.61\n0.20\nLBP554 (170, -45)\n128.0\n137.2\n9.1\n0.84\n0.20\n294.1\nRangefront Central\nResource Definition\nincluding\n134.1\n135.6\n1.5\n1.39\n1.00\nand\n144.8\n199.6\n54.9\n1.49\n0.15\nincluding\n144.8\n192.0\n47.2\n1.71\n0.20\nand including\n147.8\n160.0\n12.2\n3.99\n1.00\nand including\n150.9\n152.4\n1.5\n5.41\n5.00\nand including\n155.4\n157.0\n1.5\n5.17\nand including\n166.1\n175.3\n9.1\n1.83\n1.00\nand\n219.5\n248.4\n29.0\n0.35\n0.15\nLBP557 (225, -68)\n160.0\n170.7\n10.7\n0.32\n0.20\n281.9\nRangefront Northwest\nStep-Out\nand\n214.9\n231.6\n16.8\n1.34\nincluding\n214.9\n227.1\n12.2\n1.59\n1.00\nLBP565 (45, -45)\n51.8\n62.5\n10.7\n0.39\n0.20\n294.1\nRangefront North\nStep-Out\nand\n80.8\n196.6\n115.8\n0.34\n0.15\nincluding\n131.1\n196.6\n65.5\n0.41\n0.20\nand including\n138.7\n140.2\n1.5\n1.72\n1.00\nand including\n193.5\n195.1\n1.5\n1.07\nand\n228.6\n246.9\n18.3\n0.35\n0.15\nHole ID (Az, Dip) (degrees)\nFrom (m)\nTo (m)\nIntercept (m)\nAu (g/t)\nCut-off Au (g/t)\nHole Length (m)\nTarget\nComments\nLBP567 (340, -60)\n41.1\n48.8\n7.6\n0.54\n0.20\n221.0\nRangefront\nResource Definition\nand\n54.9\n140.2\n85.3\n0.30\n0.15\nincluding\n56.4\n64.0\n7.6\n0.47\n0.20\nand\n158.5\n178.3\n19.8\n0.31\n0.15\nincluding\n161.5\n172.2\n10.7\n0.43\n0.20\nand including\n166.1\n167.6\n1.5\n1.21\n1.00\n1Liberty Gold has changed the reporting cut-offs to include a 0.15 g/t Au cut-off, to reflect the lower cut-offs used by most operating oxide heap-leach mines in the Great Basin.

Downhole thickness are reported herein; true width varies depending on drill hole dip, but generally ranges from 60% to 80% of true thickness. Gold grades are reported uncapped Some oxide intervals report reduced cyanide solubility; a full investigation is underway. For a full table of results for the 19 new holes in this release, please see the link above.\n2022 WORK PROGRAM The 2022 exploration program at Black Pine commenced in January, with three RC and one core rig active. Drilling through to the end of February focused on the lower-elevation RFA and M Zone with the goal to continue resource expansion and confirmation, with the core drill focused on metallurgical testing. On March 1, two drills were moved to Goldstrike to commence engineering, resource upgrade and metallurgical drilling, while two drills remain at Black Pine to focus on step-out drilling and new target testing.\nLiberty Gold plans to aggressively advance Black Pine in 2022 with drilling, initial engineering and permitting programs and further de-risking activities, with the goal to provide an updated resource estimate and Preliminary Economic Assessment in the second half of 2022, subject to further positive drill results.\nABOUT BLACK PINE Black Pine is located in the northern Great Basin, immediately adjacent to the Utah/Idaho border. It is a Carlin-style gold system, similar in many ways to the prolific deposits located along Nevada\u2019s Carlin trend. Like Nevada Gold Mines\u2019 Long Canyon deposit, Black Pine represents a growing number of Carlin-style gold systems located off the main Carlin and Cortez trends in underexplored parts of the Great Basin. The historic Black Pine Mine operated from 1992 to 1997, during a period of historically low gold prices, with 435,000 ounces of gold produced from five composite, shallow pits, with an average head grade of 0.63 g/t Au.\nA mineral resource estimate containing an indicated mineral resource of 1,715,000 ounces of gold at an average grade of 0.51 g/t Au and totalling 105,075,000 tonnes; and an inferred mineral resource of 370,000 ounces of gold at an average grade of 0.37 g/t Au and totalling 31,211,000 tonnes was released on July 13, 2021, with the resource technical report filed on SEDAR on August 19, 2021, and available on the Liberty Gold website.\nA virtual site tour and 3D model of Black Pine property, including details about the geology and mineralization, is available on the homepage of the Company\u2019s website: libertygold.ca\nQUALITY ASSURANCE \u2013 QUALITY CONTROL Drill composites were calculated using cut-offs of 0.15 g/t Au, 0.20 g/t Au, 1.0 g/t Au and 5.0 g/t Au. Drill intersections are reported as drilled thicknesses. True widths of the mineralized intervals vary between 30% and 100% of the reported lengths due to varying drill hole orientations but are typically in the range of 60% to 80% of true width. Drill samples were assayed by ALS Limited in Reno, Nevada for gold by Fire Assay of a 30 gram (1 assay ton) charge with an AA finish, or if over 5.0 g/t Au were re-assayed and completed with a gravimetric finish. For these samples, the gravimetric data were utilized in calculating gold intersections. For any samples assaying over 0.10 ppm an additional cyanide leach analysis is done where the sample is treated with a 0.25% NaCN solution and rolled for an hour. An aliquot of the final leach solution is then centrifuged and analyzed by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy. QA/QC for all drill samples consists of the insertion and continual monitoring of numerous standards and blanks into the sample stream, and the collection of duplicate samples at random intervals within each batch. Selected holes are also analyzed for a 51 multi-element geochemical suite by ICP-MS. ALS Geochemistry-Reno is ISO 17025:2005 Accredited, with the Elko prep lab listed on the scope of accreditation.\nQUALIFIED PERSON Moira Smith, Ph.D., P.Geo., Vice-President Exploration and Geoscience, Liberty Gold, is the Company's designated Qualified Person for this news release within the meaning of National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\") and has reviewed and validated that the information contained in the release is accurate.\nABOUT LIBERTY GOLD Liberty Gold is focused on exploring the Great Basin of the United States, home to large-scale gold projects that are ideal for open-pit mining.

All statements in this press release, other than statements of historical fact, are \"forward-looking information\" with respect to Aurelius within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including statements with respect to the anticipated receipt of final approval from the TSX Venture Exchange, the use of proceeds of the Offering, the tax treatment of the Flow-Through Shares, the timing for the Canadian exploration expenses to be renounced in favour of the subscribers, the Company's planned drilling and exploration activities, and the anticipated development of the Aureus Gold Properties. Generally, this forward-looking information can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \"plans\", \"expects\" , \"is expected\", \"budget\", \"scheduled\", \"estimates\", \"forecasts\", \"intends\", \"anticipates\" , \"believes\", or variations or comparable language of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results \"may\", \"could\", \"would\", \"should\", \"might\" or \"will be taken\", \"occur\" or \"be achieved\" or the negative connotation thereof. Forward-looking information is necessarily based upon a number of factors and assumptions that, if untrue, could cause the actual results, performances or achievements of Aurelius to be materially different from future results, performances or achievements expressed or implied by such statements. Such statements and information are based on numerous assumptions regarding present and future business strategies and the environment in which Aurelius will operate in the future, including the price of gold, anticipated costs and ability to achieve goals.\nCertain important factors that could cause actual results, performances or achievements to differ materially from those in the forward-looking information include, among others, gold price volatility, mining operational and development risks, litigation risks, regulatory restrictions (including environmental regulatory restrictions and liability), changes in national and local government legislation, taxation, controls or regulations and/or change in the administration of laws, policies and practices, expropriation or nationalization of property and political or economic developments in Canada, delays, suspension and technical challenges associated with projects, higher prices for fuel, steel, power, labour and other consumables, currency fluctuations, the speculative nature of gold exploration, the global economic climate, dilution, share price volatility, competition, loss of key employees, additional funding requirements and defective title to mineral claims or property. Although Aurelius believes its expectations are based upon reasonable assumptions and has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking information, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended.Mineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no certainty that all or any part of the Mineral Resources will be converted to Mineral Reserves. Inferred Mineral Resources are based on limited drilling which suggests the greatest uncertainty for a resource estimate and that geological continuity is only implied. Additional drilling will be required to verify geological and mineralization continuity and it is reasonable that most of the Inferred Mineral resources could be upgraded to Indicated Mineral Resources.\nThe Company provides forward-looking information for the purpose of conveying information about current expectations and plans relating to the future and readers are cautioned that such statements may not be appropriate for other purposes. By its nature, this information is subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause the actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements of Aurelius to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, including but not limited to: the risk that the Company cannot complete the remainder of the Offering on the terms described herein, on the timing described herein or at all, risks related to completion of the updated mineral resource estimate for the Aureus Gold Properties within the expected schedule, risks related to difficulties in executing exploration programs at the Aureus Gold Properties, the Mikwam and Lipton properties on the Company's proposed schedules and within its cost and scheduling estimates, whether due to weather conditions, availability or interruption of power supply, mechanical equipment performance problems, natural disasters or pandemics in the areas where it operates, the integration of acquisition; risks related to current global financial conditions including market reaction to the coronavirus outbreak; competition within the industry; actual results of current exploration activities; environmental risks; changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined; future price of gold; failure of plant, equipment or processes to operate as anticipated; mine development and operating risks; accidents, labour disputes and other risks of the mining industry; delays in obtaining approvals or financing; risks related to indebtedness and the service of such indebtedness, as well as those factors, risks and uncertainties identified and reported in Aurelius' public filings under Aurelius' SEDAR profile at www.sedar.com. Although Aurelius has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking information, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. There can be no assurance that such information will prove to be accurate as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof and, accordingly, are subject to change after such date. Aurelius disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise unless required by law.\nNOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO US NEWS WIRE SERVICES OR FOR DISSEMINATON INTO THE UNITED STATES NEWS RELEASE",

The organization now expects economic growth of 3.2% this year, down from a prior 4.1% forecast.\nChina also reported that its economy slowed in March as consumption, real estate and exports were hit hard, worsening an outlook already weakened by COVID-19 curbs and the Ukraine war.\n\"Stocks continued to search for sustained upside momentum amid high inflation readings, interest rates on the rise, and dashed hopes for a cease fire in Ukraine,\" said Chris Larkin, managing director at E*TRADE.\nOIL, BOND YIELDS SURGE\nOil prices closed over 1% higher, boosted by concerns over tight global supply amid the Ukraine crisis.\nThose concerns were amplified after Libya's National Oil Corp said a \"painful wave\" of closures were impacting its facilities, offsetting any concerns about reduced demand from a locked down China.\n\"With global supplies now so tight, even the most minor disruption is likely to have an outsized impact on prices,\" said Jeffrey Halley, analyst at brokerage OANDA.\nBrent crude settled 1.3% higher at $113.16 a barrel after earlier hitting $114.84, its highest since March 28. U.S. crude ended up 1.2% at $108.21 per barrel.\nThe looming prospect of aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve helped push U.S. Treasury yields to three-year highs while boosting other safe havens.\nThe Fed is now expected to hike rates by 50 basis points at its May and June meetings, at least, as it looks to contain rapid inflation. Fed funds futures traders are expecting the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate to rise to 1.28% in June and to 2.67% next February, from 0.33% now.",

Half of the core is kept on site for reference, and its counterpart is sent for preparation and assaying to African Laboratory for Mining and Environment (\"Afrilab\") in Marrakech, Morocco. All samples are analyzed for silver, copper, iron, lead, and zinc using Aqua regia and finished by atomic absorption spectroscopy (\"AAS\"). Samples grading above 200 g/t Ag are reanalyzed using fire assaying.\nFor definition drilling using T28 drilling equipment, all individual samples represent 1.2m in length. Samples are assayed at either the Zgounder Mine Laboratory (\"ZMSM\") or at Afrilab. At Afrilab, all samples are analyzed for silver, copper, iron, lead, and zinc using Aqua regia and finished by AAS. Samples grading above 200 g/t Ag are reanalyzed using fire assaying. At ZMSM, all samples are analyzed for silver only using Aqua regia and finished by AAS. Rigorous quality controls (QaQc) are applied at both locations.\nMarc-Antoine Audet, Ph.D. P.

Red Hill property located in the Cortez gold trend of north-central Nevada. To view this news release with its graphics displayed please link to: https://nulegacygold.com/news/news-releases/nulegacy-gold-provides-guidance-for-2022-programs/\nHighlights:\nAfter an extended period of review NuLegacy is planning:\nAn initial 6 (of a possible 12) hole reverse circulation with core-tail drilling program totaling approximately 12,000 ft. (3,700 meters for the first 6 holes) to test newly defined targets within favorable host rock in the Mid-Rift corridor between the Western Rift (focus of 2020-21 drilling) and the Serena/North and Central Iceberg corridor (see map below and linked).\nAn additional 5 holes into the Western Rift to follow up on the widely spaced 11-hole 2020-21 drill program which encountered significant intervals of Carlin-style alteration, trace element geochemistry and important intercepts of anomalous gold in favorable host rocks and structural settings. This data is interpreted as the margin of a robust Carlin-type gold system, or systems.\nWith gold approaching US$2,000/ounce, 5 to 7 infill RC drill holes in the Serena/North zones to further evaluate a possible gold resource in the Iceberg corridor by drilling the ~ 430-meter gap between hole SR (Serena) 18-02 (16.9 grams gold over 8.7 meters) and WS (Western Slope) 19-02 (9.6 grams gold over 5.1 meters). (See news releases \u2013 Aug. 27/18 and Feb. 18/20).\nA leaner, focused exploration and corporate management team.\nA modest cash position to commence exploration and evaluate potential strategic alternatives.\n2022 Summer Drill Program: Over the fall and winter, our exploration team worked diligently to complete a full review of NuLegacy\u2019s exploration and drill results from the past 12 years, including re-logging of 150,000+ feet of core and RC drill chips, analyzing countless assays and multi-element geochemistry results and reviewing and re-mapping of key geological structures and formations to update and refine the exploration model and vector the drill plans towards the most prospective target zones within our district scale 108 sq. km. Red Hill property.\nMid-Rift: As highlighted above, the geo-team has identified key high priority drill targets in the area between the Western Rift zones and the previously discovered Serena, North and Central Iceberg zones (Iceberg corridor) and submitted permit applications for these targets as well as new road construction.\nCretaceous diorite intrusive bodies occur as approximate north-northwest oriented dikes coincident within the Iceberg corridor\u2019s South, Central and North zones (associated metamorphic alteration likely is enhancing host rock favorability). One dike trend roughly follows the Iceberg fault, and another is evidenced about 200 meters to the west.\nThe newly identified NNW trending fault zone within the Mid-Rift targets is supported by air photo linears and mapping data and is coincident with a change in CSAMT characteristics of the Miocene basalt flows (western edge of stronger alteration) \u2013 the same fault zone probably had high fluid flow in the Eocene, and likely produced the Carlin-type mineralization below.\nThe planned 2022 holes will be considerably shallower (and much less expensive) than the deep 2,500 to 4,000-foot core holes drilled in 2021.\nCharles Weakly said, \u201cMuch of the Carlin-style alteration, structure and pathfinder element geochemistry we are seeing in our exploratory drilling is consistent with what is seen in holes just outside the deposits at Goldrush/4-Mile.\u201d I\nWestern Rift: While the 11-hole 2020-21 program failed to discover significant amounts of gold mineralization, all that deep drilling provided NuLegacy\u2019s geo-team with excellent data instrumental to their understanding of key geological structures, trends and zones of Carlin-style alteration and multi-element traces for defining the 2022 drill targets.\nThis data, along with Colog, core logging, and cross section work, points to a series of uplifted and down-dropped blocks in the Paleozoic section caused by a swarm of west dipping low angle faults that are favorably laden with deep tapping lamprophyre type dikes.\nDr. Roger Steininger, NuLegacy Director, Exploration, says, \u201cWe have the Central-mineralized zone type low angle faults and have found numerous en-echelon faults like it, and are now seeking steep Iceberg-type cross-faults (on echelon to the west of the Iceberg fault) intersecting them to locate a possible gold deposit in the Mid-Rift and Western Rift.\u201d\nIceberg Corridor: With gold prices approaching US$ 2,000/ounce we intend to complete 5 to 7 infill RC drill holes in the Serena/North zones to further evaluate the potential for a gold resource in the Iceberg corridor.\nThe Iceberg gold bearing corridor (deposit) is approximately 3 km long and several hundred meters wide. Drilling has defined three centers of gold concentrations (North, Central, and South zones) with limited drilling between the higher-grade intervals in the Serena and Western Slope zones just to the west.\nMuch of the mineralization in the Iceberg deposit is near surface and oxidized. Construction of cross sections is in progress to determine the potential quantity of gold mineralization in the deposit(s).\nDrilling: More complete presentations on the prospective targets will be provided as we prepare to drill them. We are actively negotiating contract arrangements for drill rigs and road construction for a planned start of our initial 2022 drill program in late May-early June as final permits are received.\nLeaner Exploration and Corporate Finance Team: Over the fall and winter of 2021, the Company reduced its exploration team from seven members (whilst drilling with 4 rigs at Red Hill in summer 2021) to three key members required to review and refine NuLegacy\u2019s drilling model and exploration plans for 2022. Charles Weakly, NuLegacy\u2019s Exploration Manager, continues to lead our exploration team and remains fully focused and excited by the Red Hill\u2019s prospect for hosting a significant Carlin-style gold deposit.\nNuLegacy also reduced its corporate management and associated \u201coverheads\u201d by approximately 40% and marketing budget by close to 80% over the past 24 months to conserve cash and is now undertaking certain strategic corporate hires and re-introducing a modest marketing budget as we gear up for the 2022 summer drilling and exploration program. We also plan to supplement the exploration team as necessary to ensure its ability to carry out the 2022 summer-fall drill program and process results in an effective and timely manner.\nNuLegacy also announces that Mr. Edward Cope has stepped down as a director of the Company for personal reasons. The board of directors of NuLegacy expresses its sincere gratitude and thanks to Ed for his faithful commitment and services during the past five years, and Albert Matter, NuLegacy\u2019s CEO, adds his \u201cappreciation for Ed\u2019s sound guidance and the quality of people he helped to attract to NuLegacy over the past five years. We wish him all the best in his retirement.\u201d\nNuLegacy\u2019s board of directors now consists of four directors, Albert Matter, Alex Davidson, Roger Steininger and John Budreski, and the Company plans to continue with this leaner corporate structure for the foreseeable future.\nCorporate Objectives: NuLegacy currently has a modest cash position of C$5 million to commence its initial 2022 drill program and carry out corporate operations. Our immediate focus is to finalize drill targets, engage contractors and complete permitting with a view to commencing the 2022 exploration program in late May or early June while preparing to augment the treasury when appropriate.\nAfter 12 years and ~ $50 million spent exploring the Red Hill property, management is acutely aware of the challenges facing a junior exploration company searching for elephant sized Carlin-style gold deposits. The directors and corporate management of NuLegacy are encouraged that the geo-team\u2019s work continues to support the Red Hill\u2019s potential for hosting a significant deposit. The highly concentrated, narrow footprints associated with these large-ounce high-grade Carlin-style gold deposits in the Cortez and Carlin trends of Nevada illustrate the elusive nature of these \u201celephants\u201d, as evidenced by the fact all seven of the largest multi-million ounce deposits1 in the Carlin and Cortez trends are owned by majors (Barrick and Newmont).\nAs part of NuLegacy\u2019s corporate objectives, management and the board of directors intend to explore alternative corporate and strategic initiatives for financing the continued exploration of the Red Hill property. This includes a possible merger and/or buy-out by a Nevada focused mid-tier gold producer and/or exploration company with the necessary funding capabilities and additional expertise to carry out the continued exploration and drilling necessary to fully explore the Red Hill property\u2019s potential for hosting a large Carlin-style gold deposit.\nStock Options: NuLegacy has granted stock options to certain key directors and officers to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,075,000 common shares exercisable for a period of five years at a price of $0.05 per share, subject to certain vesting requirements.\nOn trend: NuLegacy Goldis focused on confirming potential high-grade Carlin-style gold deposits within its flagship 108 sq. km (42 sq. mile) district scale Red Hill Property in the Cortez gold trend of Nevada. The Rift Anticline target islocated on trend and adjacentI to three, multi-million ounce Carlin-type gold deposits (the Pipeline, Cortez Hills and Goldrush deposits) which are ranked amongst the world\u2019s thirty largest, lowest cost and politically safest gold mines and are three of Nevada Gold Mines\u2019 most profitable mines.II\n1 All seven are amongst the world's thirty largest gold mines.\nI The similarity and proximity of these deposits in the Cortez Trend including Goldrush are not necessarily indicative of the gold mineralization in NuLegacy\u2019s Red Hill Property.\nII As extracted from Barrick\u2019s Q4-2013 and Q1-2014 reports. As reported by Barrick, the Goldrush resource contains 8,557,000 indicated ounces of gold within 25.78 million tonnes grading ~10.57 g/t and 1,650,000 inferred ounces within 5.6 million tonnes grading ~9.0 g/t.\nDr. Roger Steininger, a Director of NuLegacy, is a Certified Professional Geologist (CPG 7417) and the qualified person as defined by NI 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, responsible for approving the scientific and technical information contained in this news release.\nOn Behalf of the Board of NuLegacy Gold Corporation,\nAlbert Matter, Chief Executive Officer & Founding Director Tel: +1 (604) 639-3640; Email: albert@nuggold.com\nCautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Information: This news release contains forward-looking information and statements under applicable securities laws, which information and/or statements relate to future events or future performance (including, but not limited to, the prospective nature of the Red Hill Property and its potential to host a significant Carlin-style gold deposit; the current modeling and proposed 2022 exploration and drill program for the Red Hill Property including potential locations and number of drill sites/ targets, the nature and type of drilling, number of holes, total meters, and the timing and costs thereof; the existence of potential mineral resources; and potential strategic alternatives to support future exploration including the possible merger and/or buy out by a strategic mid-tier gold producer or otherwise) and reflect management\u2019s current expectations and beliefs based on assumptions made by and information currently available to the Company.

For further information please see the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements and Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&A\") filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com under the Company\u2019s profile.\nFirst Quarter 2022 Highlights\nOperations\n-\nQ1 gold production: 93,209 ounces in Q1 2022. Production was heavily impacted in the earlier part of the quarter by COVID-related absenteeism, weather related challenges and power outages at our operations. In the latter part of the quarter, most operations returned to planned levels of tonnage, grades and production.\n-\nQ1 gold sales: 94,472 ounces at an average realized gold price per ounce sold (1) of $1,889 in Q1 2022.\n-\nCash operating costs(1): $835 per ounce sold in Q1 2022. The increase in cost was primarily driven by lower overall gold production and an increase in the price of certain commodities and consumables.\n-\nAll-in sustaining costs (\"AISC\")(1): $1,347 per ounce sold in Q1 2022.\n-\nTotal capital expenditures: $60.8 million in Q1 2022, including $5.6 million of growth capital(1) spent at Skouries with activity focused on cladding of the process plant, commencement of basic engineering, and continued preservation of site facilities and equipment. Growth capital of $23.7 million in Q1 2022 focused on waste stripping at Kisladag and construction of the North leach pad.\n-\nProduction outlook: We are maintaining our 2022 annual guidance of 460,000 \u2013 490,000 ounces of gold production.\nFinancial\n-\nCash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital(1): $49.7 million in Q1 2022.\n-\nCash, cash equivalents and term deposits: $434.7 million, as at March 31, 2022.\n-\nAdjusted EBITDA(1): $62.1 million in Q1 2022.\n-\nNet loss: Q1 2022 net loss attributable to shareholders of the Company was $316.8 million or $1.74 loss per share. Lower net income in Q1 2022 is primarily attributable to an impairment of $365.4 million ($345.4 million, net of deferred tax) of the Certej project, a non-core asset, and a write-down of $19.8 million ($15.4 million, net of deferred tax) relating to decommissioned equipment at Kisladag.\n-\nAdjusted net loss(1): $19.0 million net loss, or $0.10 loss per share in Q1 2022. Adjusted net loss in Q1 2022 removes, among other things, the non-cash impairment charge related to the Certej project and the non-cash write-down of decommissioned equipment at Kisladag.\n-\nFree cash flow(1): Negative $26.8 million in Q1 2022, primarily due to lower gold production and sales.\n-\nFinancial outlook: Cash operating costs and AISC were higher in Q1 2022 due to operational challenges that resulted in lower gold ounces produced and sold. In light of significant volatility in prices for electricity, fuel, reagents and other consumables required for our operations, we are monitoring the impact on expected full year operating and capital costs and will provide an update next quarter.\n(1) These financial measures or ratios are non-IFRS financial measures or ratios. Certain additional disclosures for non-IFRS financial measures and ratios have been incorporated by reference and additional detail can be found at the end of this press release and in the section 'Non-IFRS and Other Financial Measures and Ratios' in the Company's March 31, 2022 MD&A.\nOther\n-\nStrengthened union agreements: In January 2022, we completed a two-year collective bargaining agreement with our labour union in Turkey. Adjustments were incorporated in light of continued high consumer inflation rates to support our workforce with rising costs of food and electricity. In April 2022, we also completed a two-year collective bargaining agreement with our labour unions in Greece. The agreement incorporates technology and flexibility to support the achievement of productivity and efficiency targets.\n\"Our global operations were met with significant challenges in the first quarter,\u201d said George Burns, Eldorado\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Severe weather in Turkey and Greece, a government-mandated power outage in Turkey, and COVID-related absenteeism across all sites impacted our production. As we previously indicated, production in 2022 is expected to be heavily weighted to the second half of the year. Despite the headwinds, we have seen operations improve towards the end of the quarter and are maintaining our consolidated full-year guidance of 460,000 to 490,000 ounces of gold,\" added Burns.\n\u201cDuring the quarter, we made meaningful progress at Skouries, our development project in Greece, with activity focused on cladding of the process plant, commencement of basic engineering, and continued preservation of site facilities and equipment. At Kisladag, the ramp-up of the newly installed HPGR is continuing, and agglomeration optimization continues to show improvements. At Lamaque, an exploration drift is currently being developed from the Triangle-Sigma decline to provide drilling platforms for resource conversion of the Ormaque deposit beginning in the second quarter.\"\n\"Our focus ahead is on maintaining positive momentum by delivering on key initiatives including a financing package for Skouries. Financing discussions continue to advance, and we are evaluating all available options including, joint venture equity partners, project and debt financing through EU and Greek lenders as well as the EU Recovery and Resilience Fund, and metal streams. Subject to financing and Board approval, target restart of construction at Skouries is in the second half of 2022.\"\nConsolidated Financial and Operational Highlights\n| 3 months ended March 31, | ||||||\n| Continuing Operations(6) | 2022 | 2021 | ||||\n| Revenue | $ | 194.7 | $ | 224.6 | ||\n| Gold produced (oz) | 93,209 | 111,742 | ||||\n| Gold sold (oz) | 94,472 | 113,594 | ||||\n| Average realized gold price ($/oz sold)(2) | $ | 1,889 | $ | 1,732 | ||\n| Production costs | $ | 104.6 | $ | 108.6 | ||\n| Cash operating costs ($/oz sold)(2,3) | $ | 835 | $ | 641 | ||\n| Total cash costs ($/oz sold)(2,3) | $ | 941 | $ | 687 | ||\n| All-in sustaining costs ($/oz sold)(2,3) | $ | 1,347 | $ | 986 | ||\n| Net (loss) earnings for the period(1,4) | $ | (316.8 | ) | $ | 14.3 | |\n| Net (loss) earnings earnings per share \u2013 basic ($/share)(1,4) | $ | (1.74 | ) | $ | 0.08 | |\n| Adjusted net (loss) earnings (1,2,4) | $ | (19.0 | ) | $ | 25.2 | |\n| Adjusted net (loss) earnings per share ($/share)(1,2,4) | $ | (0.10 | ) | $ | 0.14 | |\n| Net cash generated from operating activities(5) | $ | 35.2 | $ | 99.1 | ||\n| Cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital(2,5) | $ | 49.7 | $ | 81.2 | ||\n| Free cash flow(2,5) | $ | (26.8 | ) | $ | 33.4 | |\n| Cash, cash equivalents and term deposits | $ | 434.7 | $ | 533.8 |\n(1) Attributable to shareholders of the Company.\n(2) These financial measures or ratios are non-IFRS financial measures or ratios.

See Note 17 of our condensed consolidated interim financial statements. Amounts presented are from continuing operations only.\nTotal revenue was $194.7 million in Q1 2022, a decrease of 13% from total revenue of $224.6 million in Q1 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by lower sales volumes in Q1 2022, and was partly offset by higher average metal prices.\nProduction costs decreased to $104.6 million in Q1 2022 from $108.6 million in Q1 2021 primarily due the suspension of operations at Stratoni at the end of 2021. Production costs at Stratoni totalled $15.3 million in Q1 2021. This decrease was partly offset by increases in certain production costs in Q1 2022 as a result of supply concerns caused by financial and trade sanctions against Russia, and ongoing supply chain challenges due to COVID-19. Cost increases primarily impacted electricity, fuel and reagents.\nCash operating costs in Q1 2022 averaged $835 per ounce sold, an increase from $641 per ounce sold in Q1 2021. The increase was primarily due to lower production in the quarter, combined with an increase in certain production costs. AISC per ounce sold increased to $1,347 in Q1 2022, from $986 in Q1 2021, primarily due to the increase in cash operating costs per ounce sold, combined with higher royalty expense.\nWe reported net loss attributable to shareholders from continuing operations of $316.8 million ($1.74 loss per share) in Q1 2022, compared to net earnings of $14.3 million ($0.08 earnings per share) in Q1 2021. Lower net income in Q1 2022 is primarily attributable to the impairment of the Certej project, a non-core gold asset, and the write-down of decommissioned equipment at Kisladag.\nAdjusted net loss was $19.0 million ($0.10 loss per share) in Q1 2022, compared to adjusted net earnings of $25.2 million ($0.14 earnings per share) in Q1 2021. Adjusted net loss in Q1 2022 removed the $365.4 million ($278.0 million attributable to shareholders and net of deferred tax) non-cash impairment of Certej, the $19.8 million ($15.4 million net of deferred tax) non-cash write-down of decommissioned equipment at Kisladag, $12.4 million loss on foreign exchange due to translation of deferred tax balances, a $7.0 million gain on the non-cash revaluation of the derivative related to redemption options in our debt and a $1.0 million deferred tax recovery relating to the impact of tax rate changes in Turkey.\nOperations Update\nGold Operations\n| 3 months ended March 31, | |||||\n| 2022 | 2021 | ||||\n| Total | |||||\n| Ounces produced | 93,209 | 111,742 | |||\n| Ounces sold | 94,472 | 113,594 | |||\n| Production costs | $ | 104.6 | $ | 108.6 | |\n| Cash operating costs ($/oz sold) (1,2) | $ | 835 | $ | 641 | |\n| All-in sustaining costs ($/oz sold) (1,2) | $ | 1,347 | $ | 986 | |\n| Sustaining capital expenditures (2) | $ | 24.5 | $ | 20.5 | |\n| Kisladag | |||||\n| Ounces produced | 29,779 | 46,172 | |||\n| Ounces sold | 29,778 | 47,507 | |||\n| Production costs | $ | 30.1 | $ | 26.3 | |\n| Cash operating costs ($/oz sold) (1,2) | $ | 861 | $ | 492 | |\n| All-in sustaining costs ($/oz sold) (1,2) | $ | 1,084 | $ | 607 | |\n| Sustaining capital expenditures (2) | $ | 2.5 | $ | 2.8 | |\n| Lamaque | |||||\n| Ounces produced | 33,377 | 28,835 | |||\n| Ounces sold | 34,125 | 29,078 | |||\n| Production costs | $ | 27.2 | $ | 23.0 | |\n| Cash operating costs ($/oz sold) (1,2) | $ | 763 | $ | 759 | |\n| All-in sustaining costs ($/oz sold) (1,2) | $ | 1,182 | $ | 1,162 | |\n| Sustaining capital expenditures (2) | $ | 13.0 | $ | 9.3 | |\n| Efemcukuru | |||||\n| Ounces produced | 21,057 | 23,298 | |||\n| Ounces sold | 21,382 | 24,130 | |||\n| Production costs | $ | 17.0 | $ | 14.6 | |\n| Cash operating costs ($/oz sold) (1,2) | $ | 648 | $ | 525 | |\n| All-in sustaining costs ($/oz sold) (1,2) | $ | 999 | $ | 693 | |\n| Sustaining capital expenditures (2) | $ | 3.5 | $ | 2.6 | |\n| Olympias | |||||\n| Ounces produced | 8,996 | 13,437 | |||\n| Ounces sold | 9,187 | 12,879 | |||\n| Production costs | $ | 30.2 | $ | 29.4 | |\n| Cash operating costs ($/oz sold) (1,2) | $ | 1,449 | $ | 1,145 | |\n| All-in sustaining costs ($/oz sold) (1,2) | $ | 2,399 | $ | 1,799 | |\n| Sustaining capital expenditures (2) | $ | 5.6 | $ | 5.8 |\n(1) Revenues from silver, lead and zinc sales are off-set against cash operating costs.\n(2) These financial measures or ratios are non-IFRS financial measures or ratios. See the section 'Non-IFRS and Other Financial Measures and Ratios' in the Company's MD&A for explanations and discussion of these non-IFRS financial measures and ratios.\nKisladag\nKisladag produced 29,779 ounces of gold in Q1 2022, a 36% decrease from 46,172 ounces in Q1 2021. The decrease was primarily due to COVID-19 related absenteeism, severe weather and an approximate three-day government-mandated power outage. The decrease was also the result of lower tonnage placed on the heap leach pad in Q4 2021 during the commissioning of the high-pressure grinding rolls circuit (\"HPGR\"). Average grade declined to 0.61 grams per tonne in Q1 2022 from 0.77 grams per tonne in Q1 2021.\nTonnes placed on the heap leach pad in Q1 2022 were lower than planned, primarily due to snowfall and prolonged freezing temperatures that impacted the ore conveyance and stacking system, reducing productivity in the quarter. Tonnes placed on the pad and production ramped up in March and optimization of the agglomeration circuit continued. The HPGR is performing to plan, with recovery rates as expected. Lower tonnes placed on the heap leach pad in Q1 2022 are expected to negatively impact gold production in Q2 2022.\nRevenue decreased to $56.6 million in Q1 2022 from $85.7 million in Q1 2021, reflecting lower sales in the quarter and partly offset by an increase in the average realized gold price.\nProduction costs increased to $30.1 million in Q1 2022 from $26.3 million in Q1 2021 primarily due to cost increases in labour, reagents, electricity and fuel. These increases, combined with lower production in the quarter, resulted in a significant increase in cash operating costs per ounce sold to $861 in Q1 2022 from $492 in Q1 2021.\nAISC per ounce sold increased to $1,084 in Q1 2022 from $607 in Q1 2021, primarily due to the increase in cash operating costs per ounce sold, combined with an increase in royalty expense. The increase in royalty expense to $3.7 million in Q1 2022 from $2.1 million in Q1 2021 was primarily due to a $2.8 million reversal of expense recorded in Q1 2021 following an amendment of retroactive gold royalty rates, and to a lesser extent, due to higher gold royalty rates in Q1 2022 in line with higher gold prices in the quarter.\nSustaining capital expenditures(1) of $2.5 million in Q1 2022 primarily included equipment rebuilds and processing improvements. Growth capital expenditures of $20.0 million in Q1 2022 included waste stripping to support the mine life extension, and construction of the first phase of the North heap leach pad. Severe weather in the quarter resulted in some delays in construction of the North heap leach pad and it is expected to be available for stacking in late 2022.\nLamaque\nLamaque produced 33,377 ounces of gold in Q1 2022, a 16% increase from 28,835 ounces in Q1 2021 and primarily due to higher throughput in the quarter. COVID-19 related absenteeism led to a reduction in workforce hours in January and February. This delayed the underground development of high-grade stopes, which led to lower than planned gold grades in the quarter. Mine development increased in March and gold grade and tonnage returned to planned levels. Average grade increased slightly to 5.27 grams per tonne in Q1 2022 from 5.17 grams per tonne in Q1 2021. Full-year gold production at Lamaque is expected to be in line with guidance.\nRevenue increased to $64.9 million in Q1 2022 from $52.0 million in Q1 2021 due to higher production in the quarter, combined with a higher average realized gold price.\nProduction costs increased to $27.2 million in Q1 2022 from $23.0 million in Q1 2021, primarily due to higher production in the quarter. Cost increases for consumables were partly offset by a slightly weaker Canadian dollar during the quarter. Cash operating costs per ounce sold increased to $763 in Q1 2022 from $759 in Q1 2021, primarily reflecting higher production.\nAISC per ounce sold increased to $1,182 in Q1 2022 from $1,162 in Q1 2021, primarily due to an increase in sustaining capital expenditure. Sustaining capital expenditure of $13.0 million in Q1 2022 primarily included underground development and construction. Growth capital expenditure of $1.8 million in Q1 2022 was primarily construction of underground infrastructure.\n(1) These financial measures or ratios are non-IFRS financial measures or ratios. Certain additional disclosures for non-IFRS financial measures and ratios have been incorporated by reference and additional detail can be found at the end of this press release and in the section 'Non-IFRS and Other Financial Measures and Ratios' in the Company's March 31, 2022 MD&A.\nEfemcukuru\nEfemcukuru produced 21,057 payable ounces of gold in Q1 2022, a 10% decrease from 23,298 payable ounces in Q1 2021. The decrease was due to a planned decrease in grade to 5.95 grams per tonne in Q1 2022 from 6.67 grams per tonne in Q1 2021, and was partly offset by higher throughput during the quarter despite experiencing COVID-19 related absenteeism.\nRevenue increased to $41.3 million in Q1 2022 compared to $39.8 million in Q1 2021. The increase was due to a higher average realized gold price during Q1 2022, partly offset by lower payable gold ounces sold.\nProduction costs increased to $17.0 million in Q1 2022 from $14.6 million in Q1 2021 due to increased tonnes processed, combined with cost increases in labour, electricity and consumables. These increases, combined with lower production in the quarter, resulted in an increase in cash operating costs per ounce sold to $648 in Q1 2022, from $525 in Q1 2021.\nAISC per ounce sold increased to $999 in Q1 2022 from $693 in Q1 2021, primarily due to the increase in cash operating costs per ounce sold, combined with an increase in royalty expense. The increase in royalty expense to $3.1 million in Q1 2022 from $0.8 million in Q1 2021 was primarily due to a $1.7 million reversal of expense recorded in Q1 2021 following an amendment of retroactive gold royalty rates, and to a lesser extent, due to higher gold royalty rates in Q1 2022 in line with higher gold prices in the quarter.\nSustaining capital expenditures of $3.5 million in Q1 2022 was primarily underground development and growth capital expenditures of $0.4 million includes resource conversion drilling at Kokarpinar.\nOlympias\nOlympias produced 8,996 ounces of gold in Q1 2022, a 33% decrease from 13,437 ounces in Q1 2021. The decrease reflected lower processing volumes and lower gold grade in the quarter. Lead and zinc production were lower in Q1 2022 as compared to Q1 2021, also due to lower processing volumes while silver ounces produced were slightly higher due to higher grade. In January and February, gold production at Olympias was impacted by COVID-19 related absenteeism. Additionally, operations were impacted for approximately six days in January due to snowfall in the region which resulted in an approximate four-day power outage. Operations resumed mining to plan in March and achieved planned tonnage and grades for the month. Initiatives are in place to continue ramping up mine production tonnage, control the grades and maximize plant throughput for the remainder of the year. Plant throughput in Q2 2022 is expected to be impacted by planned processing tie-ins to improve water treatment plant efficiency and capacity.\nRevenue decreased to $31.2 million in Q1 2022 compared to $33.4 million in Q1 2021 primarily as a result of lower sales volumes. Gold revenue was impacted during the quarter by the 13% VAT import charge levied on customers importing Olympias gold concentrate into China. This import charge, effective since October 1, 2021, reduces revenue by a corresponding amount. China was the primary destination of Olympias gold concentrate in Q1 2022, as shipments to Russia were halted as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. We continue to explore other markets. These decreases were partly offset by an increase in the average realized gold price in the quarter. Silver and base metal revenue increased to $16.2 million in Q1 2022 from $12.9 million in Q1 2021, primarily due to strong metal prices in the quarter.\nProduction costs increased slightly to $30.2 million in Q1 2022 from $29.4 million in Q1 2021. Consistent costs in the quarter reflected price increases in electricity, fuel and other consumables, offset by reduced consumption as a result of lower production. These price increases, combined with lower production in the quarter, resulted in an increase in cash operating costs per ounce sold to $1,449 in Q1 2022 from $1,145 in Q1 2021. This increase was partly offset by a higher proportion of silver and base metal revenue in the quarter, which reduce cash operating costs as by-product credits.\nAISC per ounce sold increased to $2,399 in Q1 2022 from $1,799 in Q1 2021 primarily due to the increase in cash operating costs per ounce sold, combined with an increase in royalty expense. Royalty expense increased to $2.5 million in Q1 2022 from $1.7 million in Q1 2021 as result of higher metal prices in the quarter. Sustaining capital expenditure of $5.6 million in Q1 2022 primarily included underground development, and resulted in a $155 increase in AISC per ounce sold due to lower gold production in the quarter.\nFor further information on the Company's operating results for the first quarter of 2022, please see the Company\u2019s MD&A filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com under the Company\u2019s profile.\nConference Call\nA conference call to discuss the details of the Company\u2019s First Quarter 2022 Results will be held by senior management on Friday, April 29, 2022 at 11:30 AM ET (8:30 AM PT).

Often, these forward-looking statements and forward-looking information can be identified by the use of words such as \"ahead\", \u201cbelieves\u201d, \u201ccontinue\u201d, \u201cexpects\u201d, \u201cfocus\u201d, \u201cguidance\u201d, \u201cintends\u201d, \"outlook\", \u201cplans\u201d, \"target\" or the negatives thereof or variations of such words and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results \u201ccan\u201d, \u201ccould\u201d, \"may\", \"might\", \u201cwill\u201d or \"would\" be taken, occur or be achieved.\nForward-looking statements or information contained in this release include, but are not limited to, statements or information with respect to: the duration, extent and other implications of production challenges and cost increases, including those in respect of COVID-19 and restrictions and suspensions with respect to the Company's operations; the Company\u2019s 2022 annual guidance, including our individual mine production; the Ormaque exploration drift; resource conversion drilling; the optimization and development of Greek operations; the Company's conference call to be held on April 29, 2022; our expectation as to our future financial and operating performance; expected metallurgical recoveries and improved concentrate grade and quality; non-IFRS financial measures and ratios; risk factors affecting our business; and our strategy, plans and goals, including our proposed exploration, development, construction, permitting, financing and operating potential, plans and priorities and related timelines. Forward-looking statements and forward-looking information by their nature are based on assumptions and involve known and unknown risks, market uncertainties and other factors, which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements or information.\nWe have made certain assumptions about the forward-looking statements and information, including assumptions about: our preliminary gold production and our guidance, benefits of the completion of the decline at Lamaque, the improvements at Kisladag and the optimization of Greek operations; tax expenses in Turkey; how the world-wide economic and social impact of COVID-19 is managed and the duration and extent of the COVID-19 pandemic; timing, cost and results of our construction and exploration; the geopolitical, economic, permitting and legal climate that we operate in; the future price of gold and other commodities; the global concentrate market; exchange rates; anticipated values, costs, expenses and working capital requirements; production and metallurgical recoveries; mineral reserves and resources; and the impact of acquisitions, dispositions, suspensions or delays on our business and the ability to achieve our goals. In addition, except where otherwise stated, we have assumed a continuation of existing business operations on substantially the same basis as exists at the time of this release.\nEven though our management believes that the assumptions made and the expectations represented by such statements or information are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statement or information will prove to be accurate. Many assumptions may be difficult to predict and are beyond our control.\nFurthermore, should one or more of the risks, uncertainties or other factors materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described in forward-looking statements or information. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, among others: inability to meet production guidance; inability to achieve the expected benefits of the completion of the decline at Lamaque, the improvements at Kisladag and the optimization of Greek operations; inability to assess income tax expenses in Turkey; risks relating to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and any future pandemic, epidemic, endemic or similar public health threats; risks relating to our operations being located in foreign jurisdictions; community relations and social license; climate change; liquidity and financing risks; development risks; indebtedness, including current and future operating restrictions, implications of a change of control, ability to meet debt service obligations, the implications of defaulting on obligations and change in credit ratings; environmental matters; waste disposal; the global economic environment; government regulation; reliance on a limited number of smelters and off-takers; commodity price risk; mineral tenure; permits; risks relating to environmental sustainability and governance practices and performance; non-governmental organizations; corruption, bribery and sanctions; litigation and contracts; information technology systems; estimation of mineral reserves and mineral resources; production and processing estimates; credit risk; actions of activist shareholders; price volatility, volume fluctuations and dilution risk in respect of our shares; reliance on infrastructure, commodities and consumables; currency risk; inflation risk; interest rate risk; tax matters; dividends; financial reporting, including relating to the carrying value of our assets and changes in reporting standards; labour, including relating to employee/union relations, employee misconduct, key personnel, skilled workforce, expatriates and contractors; reclamation and long-term obligations; regulated substances; necessary equipment; co-ownership of our properties; acquisitions, including integration risks, and dispositions; the unavailability of insurance; conflicts of interest; compliance with privacy legislation; reputational issues; competition, as well as those risk factors discussed in the sections titled \u201cForward-looking information and risks\u201d and \u201cRisk factors in our business\u201d in our most recent Annual Information Form & Form 40-F. The reader is directed to carefully review the detailed risk discussion in our most recent Annual Information Form & Form 40-F filed on SEDAR and EDGAR under our Company name, which discussion is incorporated by reference in this release, for a fuller understanding of the risks and uncertainties that affect our business and operations.\nThe inclusion of forward-looking statements and information is designed to help you understand management\u2019s current views of our near- and longer-term prospects, and it may not be appropriate for other purposes.\nThere can be no assurance that forward-looking statements or information will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements or information contained herein.

Gold ETF holdings jumped by 269 tonnes in the first three months of the year, more than making up for the 174-tonne annual outflow seen in 2021.\nCentral banks also added 84 tonnes to their global gold reserves in the quarter, with net buying more than doubling from the fourth quarter of 2021.\nGold\u2019s reaction to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine\nThe price of gold reached $2,050 per ounce in early March after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, but has since retraced its gains, falling to under $1,900 per ounce this week.\nRich said that he expects gold prices will likely remain volatile in the coming quarters as investors judge whether geopolitical tensions will continue, and if the Federal Reserve\u2019s actions to combat inflation will be successful.\n\u201cI think the market has a ton of unanswered questions out there, and gold is going to react as we start to see some of these answers unfold,\u201d he said. \u201cCan the Fed really fight inflation without throwing a wet blanket on GDP? And are we headed toward a stagflation where they can't get inflation down, but they're hurting GDP with rate hikes?\u201d\nThe Fed raised interest rates by a quarter-point in March in hopes of cooling rising consumer prices, and analysts are expecting a half-point hike could be coming in May. If inflation is controlled, it will likely be bad news for gold prices\u2014that is, unless rising rates spark a recession.\nGold tends to perform well during recessions, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows, as investors look to the physical asset to protect their wealth.\nA number of top investment banks and Wall Street titans have been sounding the alarm over the potential for a U.S. recession over the past few months as well. Deutsche Bank economists, led by head of research David Folkerts-Landau, even predicted this week a \u201cmajor recession\u201d could be in the cards for the U.S. economy, arguing the Fed is \u201cwell behind the curve\u201d when it comes to fighting inflation.",

(NASDAQ:FB) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:\n\u00e2\u20ac\u015bDuring the quarter we reinvested in Facebook. This is not the first time we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve held a position in the company, which operates the largest and most profitable social media business in the world. We first bought shares in Q4 2018, after the Cambridge Analytica scandal caused the stock to drop to less than 20x earnings.\nThat investment was successful, with users and advertisers largely shrugging off the scandal and causing revenues to grow from $40b in 2017 to $86b in 2020. EPS rose from $6 to more than $10 in 2020, and we sold our shares between $250 and $300 in mid-2020 to reinvest in stocks that had seen share price dislocations due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn Q1, Facebook investors once again got spooked, with shares falling almost 50% to under $200 per share. Today, shares trade at their lowest valuation ever: 12x earnings net of cash. We think the core business remains one of the best in the world and that issues surrounding TikTok competition, Zuckerberg\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s investments in virtual reality, and changes to iOS tracking policies are largely overblown or over-discounted in today\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s price.

We transitioned Mupane from an open pit short-term high-cost producer to an underground mine, with an extended life and significantly reduced operating costs. We have now leveraged those skills to put Galaxy into commercial production, and endeavour to do the same at Summit.\nThe Transaction also significantly improves our balance sheet and provides an opportunity for Galane Gold to provide a greater return to our stakeholders,\u201d said Nick Brodie, Chief Executive Officer.\nCedric Sam of Hawks Mining said, \u201cWe thank Galane Gold for the support they have provided in helping us complete this transaction and look forward to their continued guidance. This is a very exciting and important event with the only producing gold mine in Botswana being transitioned into majority local ownership. This is a significant first step for Hawks Mining, who like Galane Gold, intends to build a team to take on other opportunities specifically in Botswana.\u201d\nRavi Sood, the Chairman of Galane Gold, added, \u201cI would like to reiterate that our experience with Mupane in Botswana over the past 11 years has been outstanding in every respect.

(2) All-in-Sustaining Costs include cash costs plus sustaining, refining and reclamation costs, as well as 2% royalties.\nKen MacLeod, President and CEO of Sonoro, stated, \u201cWe are very pleased with the improved economic parameters of the updated PEA. Using the same resource calculations of the original PEA, we have optimized the mine plan to contemplate commencing production at a lower rate utilizing higher-grade ore, eventually ramping up to potential capacity of 15,000 mtpd in year three. The result is a reduction in the estimated initial CAPEX of over 19% and an increase in after-tax NPV and IRR of 29% and 40.4%, respectively.\u201d\nJohn Darch, Chairman of Sonoro, added, \u201cThe updated PEA again highlights the intrinsic value of the Cerro Caliche project, and we continue to assess options to potentially further improve the project\u2019s economic viability, such as leasing large capital cost equipment.The updated PEA does not include the nearly completed drilling campaign, which commenced in November 2021 after the initial PEA was published. We are excited to review the potential for resource growth from the new geological data. An increase in the size and grade of the resource may potentially further improve the project\u2019s economics and extend the proposed life of mine.\u201d\nMineral Resource Estimate The updated PEA utilizes the same geological data as the initial PEA, filed in October 2021, and is based on the Company\u2019s September 2018 to April 2021 drilling campaigns. As previously announced, the PEA estimates Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources of 349,000 ounces of gold at a 0.41 g/t Au grade and Inferred Mineral Resources of 71,000 ounces of gold at 0.40 g/t Au grade. The original report also notes a range of the potential mineralization that may conceptually exist outside of the resource pit shells believed to be from 19,250,000 to 34,370,000 tonnes containing 204,000 to 365,000 ounces of gold, as well as 1,683,000 to 3,005,000 ounces of silver.\nReaders are cautioned that these potential mineralization ranges are conceptual in nature and that despite being based on a limited amount of exploration drilling and sampling outside the current resource pit shells, it is uncertain that further exploration will result in the mineralization targets being delineated as a mineral resource.\nDrilling Data Approximately 7,000 meters of additional drilling being completed at Cerro Caliche was not included in the current mineral resource estimate. Final assay results are still pending with the new geological data to be included in a further updated resource estimate scheduled to be released in the fall of 2022.\nSince drilling resumed in November 2021, the Company has announced multiple high-grade intercepts and expansions of several known mineralized zones in the southwestern region of the property. The potential economic impact of these results on the proposed mining operation will also be assessed in the updated resource estimate.\nPEA Summary The optimized mine plan outlined in the updated PEA increased total tonnes processed from 31.5 million tonnes to 32.2 million tonnes and total waste from 65.5 million tonnes to 66.8 million tonnes. Optimization also increased the average gold grade from 0.41 g/t Au to 0.43 g/t Au for the LOM, as well as the average gold equivalent from 0.51 g/t AuEq to 0.58 g/t AuEq during the first three years of production.\nTotal recovered gold equivalent increased from 323,550 ounces to 344,674 ounces.\nThe updated PEA is preliminary in nature and includes inferred resources that are considered too speculative to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves and there is no certainty the estimates presented in the PEA will be realized.\nThe full PEA will be filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and Sonoro\u2019s website www.sonorogold.com within 45 days of the issuance of this news release.\nTable 4: Updated Operating & Capital Sensitivity Analysis (USD)\nSensitivity\n-20\n%\n-10\n%\nBase Case\n10\n%\n20\n%\nOperating Costs \u2013 Pre-tax NPV\n$147.3m\n$115.8m\n$84.4m\n$53.0m\n$21.6m\nOperating Costs \u2013 IRR\n113.1\n%\n94.6\n%\n74.9\n%\n53.2\n%\n27.4\n%\nCapital Costs \u2013 Pre-tax NPV\n$94.5m\n$89.7m\n$84.4m\n$78.6m\n$72.3m\nCapital Costs \u2013 IRR\n124.0\n%\n95.4\n%\n74.9\n%\n59.7\n%\n48.1\n%\nCapital Costs\nThe updated estimated capital costs for the Cerro Caliche Gold Project are based on an open pit, heap leach operation with contract mining.

During the period, we made significant progress at the MCSA Mining Complex on our Pilar 3.0 initiative, which included securing key long-lead items such as the third ball mill and shaft winder, advancing shaft construction and new surface installations, and completing the installation of our Cooling Project. Successful execution of these initiatives is expected to allow us to increase mining and processing capacity to accommodate significantly higher planned throughput in the years ahead.\n\"Despite these significant positive developments, the first quarter was not without challenges. In addition to an underlying strengthening of the Brazilian Real during the first quarter, our operating costs faced the same inflationary headwinds experienced globally across all industries. While many of the challenges related to costs are externally driven, we are focused on continuing to improve our operating efficiencies through existing programs and by investing in new technologies applicable across all areas of our business. At the same time, we are taking a cautious approach and currently guiding to the higher end of our full-year operating cost guidance ranges.\n\"Highlighting our pursuit of continuous improvement, we commenced an engineering initiative last year, known as Project Honeypot, that is already delivering significant near-term value for our operations. Through this initiative our engineering teams, supported by our geology and exploration group, have developed a comprehensive program to identify and recover high-grade stopes at the Pilar Mine that were left behind by previous operators decades ago. While the addition of Project Honeypot stopes to the mine plan are expected to be gradual, we anticipate a positive impact on mined copper grades commencing in the second quarter of 2022. These contributions are expected to drive higher copper production through the remainder of the year and, as a result, we are currently guiding to the high-end of our full-year production guidance range.\"\n*Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income attributable to owners of the Company, Adjusted net income per share attributable to owners of the Company, C1 cash cost per pound of copper produced, C1 cash cost per ounce of gold produced and All-in Sustaining Costs (\u201cAISC\u201d) per ounce of gold produced are non-IFRS measures \u2013 see the Notes section of this press release for additional information.

Together, the existing and new shaft currently under construction are expected to increase total hoisting capacity of the Pilar Mine to approximately 5.7 million tonnes per annum, an increase of over 60% compared to current hoisting capacity of 3.5 million tonnes per annum, offering flexibility for future mine expansions.\n-\nConstruction of the new external shaft continues to progress on schedule and on budget with excavation for the head-frame and two winder foundations completed during the first quarter.\n-\nExpansion of the Cara\u00edba Mill to 4.2 million tonnes per annum is underway with a third ball mill ordered during the period for which commissioning is expected in Q2 2023.\n-\nSignificant progress has been made in defining opportunities in the upper levels of the Pilar Mine that have the potential to add near-term value through an initiative known as \"Project Honeypot\". This engineering initiative is focused on recovering high-grade stopes, ribs and sill pillars left behind by previous operators during the late 1990s due to the under-capitalized nature of operations at the time. The first Project Honeypot stope (RC03) is approximately 130,000 tonnes grading approximately 4.00% copper and is expected to commence mining in Q2 2022.\n-\nThe second and final phase of the Cooling Project was completed subsequent to quarter-end at the Pilar Mine with hand-over to operations occurring at the end of April 2022. The Cooling Project is expected to support expansions at depth and has the potential to drive meaningful operating efficiencies.\n-\n-\nImportant advances on key workstreams at Boa Esperan\u00e7a included:\n-\nExecution of the critical-path power transmission line contract;\n-\nMobilization of the first earth works package, including new access road construction and road upgrades;\n-\nCompletion of Gap Zone and condemnation drilling; and,\n-\nMarket tendering for key contracts completed subsequent to quarter-end. Contractor and supplier selections remain ongoing.\n-\n-\n| OPERATING AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS | ||||||||\n| 3 months | 3 months | 3 months | ||||||\n| Mar. 31, 2022 | Dec. 31, 2021 | Mar. 31, 2021 | ||||||\n| Operating Highlights | ||||||||\n| Copper (MCSA Operations) | ||||||||\n| Ore Processed (tonnes) | 596,230 | 646,319 | 597,594 | |||||\n| Grade (% Cu) | 1.78 | 2.01 | 2.30 | |||||\n| Cu Production (tonnes) | 9,784 | 11,918 | 12,638 | |||||\n| Cu Production (000 lbs) | 21,570 | 26,275 | 27,863 | |||||\n| Cu Sold in Concentrate (tonnes) | 10,045 | 12,393 | 12,469 | |||||\n| Cu Sold in Concentrate (000 lbs) | 22,145 | 27,321 | 27,488 | |||||\n| C1 cash cost of Cu produced (per lb)(1) | $ | 1.31 | $ | 0.96 | $ | 0.49 | ||\n| Gold (NX Gold Operations) | ||||||||\n| Au Production (oz) | 8,796 | 8,544 | 9,451 | |||||\n| C1 cash cost of Au Produced (per oz)(1) | $ | 638 | $ | 582 | $ | 487 | ||\n| AISC of Au produced (per oz)(1) | $ | 1,092 | $ | 910 | $ | 643 | ||\n| Financial Highlights ($ in millions, except per share amounts) | ||||||||\n| Revenues | $ | 108.9 | $ | 134.9 | $ | 122.5 | ||\n| Gross profit | 61.0 | 84.4 | 82.8 | |||||\n| EBITDA(1) | 78.1 | 80.7 | 55.2 | |||||\n| Adjusted EBITDA(1) | 62.4 | 86.8 | 86.7 | |||||\n| Cash flow from operations | 44.0 | 66.7 | 62.1 | |||||\n| Net income | 52.5 | 60.2 | 32.1 | |||||\n| Net income attributable to owners of the Company | 52.1 | 59.8 | 31.7 | |||||\n| Per share (basic) | 0.58 | 0.67 | 0.36 | |||||\n| Per share (diluted) | 0.57 | 0.65 | 0.34 | |||||\n| Adjusted net income attributable to owners of the Company(1) | 33.0 | 59.7 | 56.3 | |||||\n| Per share (basic) | 0.37 | 0.67 | 0.64 | |||||\n| Per share (diluted) | 0.36 | 0.65 | 0.61 | |||||\n| Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments | 465.5 | 130.1 | 84.6 | |||||\n| Working capital(1) | 443.7 | 86.0 | 63.5 | |||||\n| Net debt(1) | (54.4 | ) | (70.9 | ) | 74.5 |\n(1) EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to owners of the Company, Adjusted net income (loss) per share attributable to owners of the Company, Net Debt, Working Capital, C1 cash cost of copper produced (per lb), C1 cash cost of gold produced (per ounce) and AISC of gold produced (per ounce) are non-IFRS measures \u2013 see the Notes section of this press release for a discussion on non-IFRS Measures.\n| ADJUSTED EBITDA & NET INCOME (LOSS) RECONCILIATION | |||\n|\n| 3 months ended | ||\n| Adjusted EBITDA | $ | 62,377 | |\n| Adjustments: | |||\n| Unrealized foreign exchange gain on USD denominated balances in MCSA | 11,279 | ||\n| Unrealized foreign exchange gain on derivative contracts | 24,714 | ||\n| Realized foreign exchange loss on derivative contracts | (4,567 | ) | |\n| Share based compensation and other | (14,707 | ) | |\n| Incremental costs in response to COVID-19 pandemic | (1,004 | ) | |\n| EBITDA | $ | 78,092 | |\n| Adjusted net income attributable to owners of the Company | $ | 32,951 | |\n| Adjustments for non-cash items (attributable to owners of the Company): | |||\n| Unrealized foreign exchange gain on USD denominated debt in MCSA | 1,337 | ||\n| Unrealized foreign exchange gain on derivative contracts, net of tax | 24,615 | ||\n| Share based compensation | (1,990 | ) | |\n| Incremental costs in response to COVID-19 pandemic | (998 | ) | |\n| Reported net income attributable to owners of the Company | $ | 55,915 |\n2022 GUIDANCE(*)\nThe Company is reaffirming its full-year production, cost and capital expenditure guidance as detailed in the tables below. At the MCSA Mining Complex, the Company is guiding to the high-end of its full- year copper production guidance range. Increased copper production is expected to result from higher mining rates at the Pilar Mine relative to the first quarter as well as improved grades due to planned stope sequencing and mining of an initial stope within the Project Honeypot zone. Higher mined and processed volumes from the Surubim Mine are also expected to contribute to higher copper production volumes through the balance of the year.\nUnit operating costs during the first quarter were affected by inflation in the cost of key consumables and impacted by the strengthening of the BRL versus the US dollar. While unit costs are expected to benefit through the remainder of the year from higher copper and gold production, based upon the influence of first quarter operating costs, the Company is currently guiding to the higher end of its full- year operating cost guidance ranges.\n2022 PRODUCTION AND COST GUIDANCE(*)\nThe Company's cost guidance for 2022 assumes a USD:BRL foreign exchange rate of 5.30, a gold price of $1,725 per ounce and a silver price of $20.00 per ounce.\n| MCSA Mining Complex | |\n| Copper Production (tonnes) | 43,000 - 46,000 |\n| C1 Cash Cost Guidance (US$/lb)(1) | $1.05 - $1.15 |\n| NX Gold Mine | |\n| Gold Production (ounces) | 39,000 - 42,000 |\n| C1 Cash Cost Guidance (US$/oz)(1) | $500 - $600 |\n| All-in Sustaining Cost (AISC) Guidance (US$/oz)(1) | $925 - $1,025 |\n(1) C1 Cash Costs and AISC are a non-IFRS measure - see the Notes section of this press release for additional information.\n2022 CAPITAL EXPENDITURE GUIDANCE(*)\nThe Company's capital expenditure guidance for 2022 assumes a USD:BRL foreign exchange rate of 5.30 and has been presented below in USD millions.\n| MCSA Mining Complex | ||\n| Growth | $125 - $140 | |\n| Sustaining | $80 - $90 | |\n| Exploration | $25 - $30 | |\n| Total, MCSA Mining Complex | $230 - $260 | |\n| Boa Esperan\u00e7a Project | ||\n| Growth | $70 - $80 | |\n| Sustaining | $0 | |\n| Exploration | $5 - $6 | |\n| Total, Boa Esperan\u00e7a Project | $75 - $86 | |\n| NX Gold Mine | ||\n| Growth | $0 - $1 | |\n| Sustaining | $16 - $18 | |\n| Exploration | $9 - $10 | |\n| Total, NX Gold Mine | $25 - $29 | |\n| Company Total | ||\n| Growth | $195 - $221 | |\n| Sustaining | $96 - $108 | |\n| Exploration | $39 - $46 | |\n| Total, Company | $330 - $375 |\n(*) Guidance is based on certain estimates and assumptions, including but not limited to, mineral reserve estimates, grade and continuity of interpreted geological formations and metallurgical performance.

These performance measures have no standardized meaning prescribed within generally accepted accounting principles under IFRS and, therefore, amounts presented may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other mining companies. These non-IFRS measures are intended to provide supplemental information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.\nC1 cash cost of copper produced (per lb.)\nC1 cash cost of copper produced (per lb) is a non-IFRS performance measure used by the Company to manage and evaluate the operating performance of its copper mining segment and is calculated as C1 cash costs divided by total pounds of copper produced during the period. C1 cash costs includes total cost of production, transportation, treatment and refining charges, and certain tax credits relating to sales invoiced to the Company's Brazilian customer on sales, net of by-product credits and incentive payments. C1 cash cost of copper produced per pound is widely reported in the mining industry as benchmarks for performance but does not have a standardized meaning and is disclosed in supplement to IFRS measures.\nC1 cash cost of gold produced (per ounce)\nC1 cash cost of gold produced (per ounce) is a non-IFRS performance measure used by the Company to manage and evaluate the operating performance of its gold mining segment and is calculated as C1 cash costs divided by total ounces of gold produced during the period. C1 cash cost includes total cost of production, net of by-product credits and incentive payments. C1 cash cost of gold produced per ounce is widely reported in the mining industry as benchmarks for performance but does not have a standardized meaning and is disclosed in supplemental to IFRS measures.\nAll-in Sustaining Cost of gold produced (per ounce)\nAll-in sustaining cost of gold produced (per ounce) is an extension of C1 cash cost of gold produced (per ounce) discussed above and is also a key performance measure used by management to evaluate operating performance of its gold mining segment. AISC of gold produced (per ounce) is calculated as AISC divided by total ounces of gold produced during the period. AISC includes C1 cash costs, site general and administrative costs, accretion of mine closure and rehabilitation provision, sustaining capital expenditures, sustaining leases, and royalties and production taxes. AISC of gold produced (per ounce) is widely reported in the mining industry as benchmarks for performance but does not have a standardized meaning and is disclosed in supplement to IFRS measures.\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-IFRS performance measures used by management to evaluate its debt service capacity and performance of its operations. EBITDA represents earnings before finance expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA before the pre-tax effect of adjustments for non-cash and/or non-recurring items required in determination of EBITDA under its revolving credit facility for covenant calculation purposes.\nAdjusted net income attributable to owners of the Company and Adjusted net income per share attributable to owners of the Company\n\u201cAdjusted net income attributable to owners of the Company\u201d is net income attributed to shareholders as reported, adjusted for certain types of transactions that, in management's judgment, are not indicative of our normal operating activities or do not necessarily occur on a recurring basis. \u201cAdjusted net income per share attributable to owners of the Company\u201d (\u201cAdjusted EPS\u201d) is calculated as \"adjusted net income attributable to owners of the Company\" divided by weighted average number of outstanding common shares in the period. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, the Company and certain investor and analysts use these supplemental non-IFRS performance measures to evaluate the normalized performance of the Company. The presentation of Adjusted EPS is not meant to substitute the net income (loss) per share attributable to owners of the Company (\u201cEPS\u201d) presented in accordance with IFRS, but rather it should be evaluated in conjunction with such IFRS measures.\nNet (Cash) Debt\nNet (cash) debt is a performance measure used by the Company to assess its financial position and ability to pay down its debt. Net (cash) debt is determined based on cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, net of loans and borrowings as reported in the Company\u2019s condensed consolidated interim financial statements.\nWorking capital and Available liquidity\nWorking capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities as reported in the Company\u2019s condensed consolidated interim financial statements. The Company uses working capital as a measure of the Company\u2019s short-term financial health and ability to meet its current obligations using its current assets. Available liquidity is calculated as the sum of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and the undrawn amount available on its revolving credit facilities. The Company uses this information to evaluate the liquid assets available.\nABOUT ERO COPPER CORP\nEro Copper Corp is a high-growth, clean copper producer with operations in Brazil and corporate headquarters in Vancouver, B.C.

Other events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ materially from those estimated or projected and expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained herein. There can be no assurance that forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements contained herein are made as of the date of this press release and the Company disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or results or otherwise, except as and to the extent required by applicable securities laws.\nCAUTIONARY NOTES REGARDING MINERAL RESOURCE AND MINERAL RESERVE ESTIMATES\nIn accordance with applicable Canadian securities regulatory requirements, all mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates of the Company disclosed in this press release have been prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 and are classified in accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (\u201cCIM\u201d) Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council on May 10, 2014 (the \u201cCIM Standards\u201d). NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators that establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects. NI 43-101 differs significantly from the disclosure requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) generally applicable to U.S. companies. For example, the terms \u201cmineral reserve\u201d, \u201cproven mineral reserve\u201d, \u201cprobable mineral reserve\u201d, \u201cmineral resource\u201d, \u201cmeasured mineral resource\u201d, \u201cindicated mineral resource\u201d and \u201cinferred mineral resource\u201d are defined in NI 43-101. These definitions differ from the definitions in the disclosure requirements promulgated by the SEC. Accordingly, information contained in this press release may not be comparable to similar information made public by U.S. companies reporting pursuant to SEC disclosure requirements.\nMineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Pursuant to the CIM Standards, mineral resources have a higher degree of uncertainty than mineral reserves as to their existence as well as their economic and legal feasibility. Inferred mineral resources, when compared with measured or indicated mineral resources, have the least certainty as to their existence, and it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will be upgraded to an indicated or measured mineral resource as a result of continued exploration. Pursuant to NI 43-101, inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of any economic analysis. Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of a mineral resource exists, will ever be converted into a mineral reserve, or is or will ever be economically or legally mineable or recovered.",

While bitcoin was created 13 years ago, gold predates human civilization. The earliest record of gold being used for decoration dates back to 4000 BC. There\u2019s a chance it was used for other purposes (perhaps barter) even prior to that.\nOver those four millennia, gold has played a pivotal role in global politics and economics. In fact, most global currencies were pegged to the value of gold until 1971. Put simply, gold has had much more time to prove its status as a store of value.\nBut just because bitcoin is new doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s less secure. The underlying blockchain has never been hacked, and the asset has certainly helped create more wealth than gold over the past 13 years.\nConvenience\nWhile gold has a wide head start, bitcoin is arguably more convenient to invest in.\nUnlike physical gold, bitcoin can be stored online or on a software wallet. It can be moved across the world in a matter of minutes for minimal costs.\nCurrently, the average bitcoin transaction costs about $1.50 and is likely to be completed in about 10 minutes.\nBy comparison, physical gold needs to be stored securely, physically moved and protected around the clock \u2014 making it less convenient for the digital age.\nVolatility\nAlthough bitcoin is easier to store and transact with, it\u2019s also much more volatile than gold.\nAccording to portfolio optimization Bitcoin\u2019s standard deviation \u2014 a measure of how much it can move beyond its average price in either direction \u2014 is 4.34. Compare that to gold\u2019s standard deviation of just above one.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a more stable asset, gold is clearly the better choice.\nCorrelation\nCorrelation is a key factor when measuring the riskiness of a particular asset.\nIf the price of a given asset moves independently from the economy or other traditional investments, adding that asset can significantly lower the risk of your overall portfolio.\nCorrelation coefficients range from -1.0 (a perfect negative correlation) to +1.0 (a perfect positive correlation). 0 shows no correlation at all.\nBitcoin\u2019s correlation to U.S. stocks has reached as high as 0.66, so it\u2019s not the best way to lower the risk profile of a traditional portfolio.\nThe gold-stock relationship changes over time depending on different economic conditions. But in times of extreme stock market volatility, gold prices have a low or even negative correlation with the S&P 500.\nCentral bank reserve assets\nGold is used as a reserve asset by central banks across the world \u2014 a key factor that makes it stand apart from Bitcoin.\nNations hold gold reserves as a safe haven, with countries like France, the United States and Germany each holding close to 80% of their total reserves in gold. This use as a reserve asset puts a theoretical floor on the value of gold.\nBitcoin is just beginning to gain acceptance from governments worldwide. El Salvador made bitcoin legal tender last year, and several other nations like Brazil and Mexico are considering the same.\nSome governments are also thinking about the digital asset as a way to circumvent sanctions. Russia, for instance, is considering accepting bitcoin as payment for its oil and gas exports.\nDistribution\nGold is naturally distributed across the world. Australia has the largest proven reserve of gold at 20% of global capacity. Meanwhile, gold that has already been mined is widely distributed among jewelry buyers, corporate buyers and central banks.\nUntil recently, the majority of bitcoin mining was done within China. But ever since China\u2019s crackdown on crypto mining, the percentage of computer energy used in the process \u2014 the so-called 'hashrate' \u2014 is more widely distributed across the world. In fact, no country currently accounts for more than 35% of mining capacity.\nBitcoin that has already been mined is similarly well distributed.\nThe largest bitcoin holding belongs to the network\u2019s anonymous founder Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto holds 1 million bitcoin, which is about 4.7% of total supply. Public companies hold roughly 1%.\nCulture\nIn some parts of the world, storing wealth in gold is deeply ingrained in local culture. For example, it\u2019s an essential part of rituals and marriages in India, which is why Indian households are sitting on a $1.5 trillion hoard of gold.\nBitcoin is rapidly gaining cultural credibility, too. According to several surveys, roughly half of North American millennials said they would put a portion of their savings in bitcoin.\nCrypto\u2019s role in internet culture and meme investing is making it a bigger force in the global economy. Whether this cultural revolution displaces gold remains to be seen.\nBottom line\nGold is certainly more stable and time-tested than Bitcoin. However, Bitcoin\u2019s drawbacks are quickly being resolved and younger investors are adopting it in greater numbers.\nOver time, the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency might actually fulfill its potential as digital gold.\nSign up for our MoneyWise newsletter to receive a steady flow of actionable ideas from Wall Street's top firms.",

This was a geotechnical drill hole within La India open pit that was initially surveyed and analysed for structures and rock strength, which once completed, was assayed for gold and silver. It adds confidence to the geological model for the forthcoming Feasibility Study and serves as a timely reminder of the wide zones of material with good open pit gold grade available near surface within the fully permitted La India Project.\u201d\nBackground\nCondor announced the completion of 21 geotechnical drill holes on the planned La India Open Pit in an RNS dated 30th November 2021. The drilling was designed to provide drill core samples through all sides of the pit wall in order to collect geotechnical information to analyse and to determine the geotechnical parameters for the final pit design to a Feasibility Study (FS) level of detail, which is to plus or minus 15% accuracy. In all cases the drill holes were collared within the open pit shell and angled to pass through the pit wall at a pre-determined location in order to sample the rock mass that will eventually form the pit wall. Three of the geotechnical holes were drilled through the principal La India mineralised zone to test the pit walls on the footwall side of the pit. The drill core collected through the mineralised zone effectively provides additional infill drill samples, and this material was assayed after the geotechnical test work had been completed.\nAssay results\nThe twin geotechnical drill holes LIGT528 and LIGT536 have provided a useful additional infill in the planned Northern Starter Pit. The drill holes returned similar intercepts of 41.05 m (28.7 m true width) at 2.62 g/t gold and 44.85 m (30.2 m true width) at 2.55 g/t gold in the hanging-wall of the historic mine workings. Of these only LIGT536 successfully drilled into the historic mine footwall to return an amalgamated hangingwall and footwall intercept of 50.70 m (34.1 m true width) at 2.56 g/t gold from 2.80 m drill depth. This intercept includes three high-grade veins in the hanging-wall of 6.0 m true width at 4.30 g/t gold, 2.0 m true width at 5.31 g/t gold and 3.6 m true width at 8.75 g/t gold, as well as a 3 m wide mine cavity (see table below). These twin holes have returned the 8th and 10th best intercepts to-date on the La India Vein (see Table 1 below).\nGeotechnical drill hole LIGT531 was drilled 150 m along strike to the southwest in the zone between the two planned starter pits. The assay results confirmed significant mineralisation at depth between the two starter pits in the segment where the La India Vein splits in two: returning significant intercepts of 7.60 m (5.3 m true width) at 3.11 g/t gold from 36.00 m drill depth (the upper La India vein), and 7.35 m (5.1 m true width) at 2.70 g/t gold from 51.45 m drill depth (the lower La India vein). These assay results add confidence to the geological model.\nTable 1.

The Company is a gold exploration and development company with a focus on Nicaragua.\nOn 25 October 2021 Condor announced the filing of a Preliminary Economic Assessment Technical Report (\u201cPEA\u201d) for its La India Project, Nicaragua on SEDAR https://www.sedar.com. The highlight of the technical study is a post-tax, post upfront capital expenditure NPV of US$418 million, with an IRR of 54% and 12 month pay-back period, assuming a US$1,700 per oz gold price, with average annual production of 150,000 oz gold per annum for the initial 9 years of gold production. The open pit mine schedules have been optimised from designed pits, bringing higher grade gold forward resulting in average annual production of 157,000 oz gold in the first 2 years from open pit material and underground mining funded out of cashflow.\nIn August 2018, the Company announced that the Ministry of the Environment in Nicaragua had granted the Environmental Permit (\u201cEP\u201d) for the development, construction and operation of a processing plant with capacity to process up to 2,800 tonnes per day at its wholly-owned La India gold Project (\u201cLa India Project\u201d). The EP is considered the master permit for mining operations in Nicaragua. Condor has purchased a new SAG Mill, which has mainly arrived in Nicaragua. Site clearance and preparation is at an advanced stage.\nEnvironmental Permits were granted in April and May 2020 for the Mestiza and America open pits respectively, both located close to La India. The Mestiza open pit hosts 92 Kt at a grade of 12.1 g/t gold (36,000 oz contained gold) in the Indicated Mineral Resource category and 341 Kt at a grade of 7.7 g/t gold (85,000 oz contained gold) in the Inferred Mineral Resource category. The America open pit hosts 114 Kt at a grade of 8.1 g/t gold (30,000 oz) in the Indicated Mineral Resource category and 677 Kt at a grade of 3.1 g/t gold (67,000 oz) in the Inferred Mineral Resource category. Following the permitting of the Mestiza and America open pits, together with the La India Open Pit Condor has 1.12 M oz gold open pit Mineral Resources permitted for extraction.\nDisclaimer\nNeither the contents of the Company's website nor the contents of any website accessible from hyperlinks on the Company's website (or any other website) is incorporated into, or forms part of, this announcement.\nQualified Persons\nThe technical and scientific information in this press release has been reviewed, verified and approved by Andrew Cheatle, P.Geo., who is a \u201cqualified person\u201d as defined by NI 43-101 and Gerald D.

Usually reported as parts per million which is equivalent to grams of the mineral (i.e., gold) per tonne of rock |\nAu | Gold |\nBreccia | A rock made up of angular rock fragments cemented together by a finer grained matrix |\nDiamond core drilling | A drilling method in which penetration is achieved through abrasive cutting by rotation of a diamond encrusted drill bit. This drilling method enables collection of tubes of intact rock (core) and when successful gives the best possible quality samples for description, sampling and analysis of an ore body or mineralised structure. |\nFoot wall | Originally a miner\u2019s term to refer to the rock below the mineralised zone that they exploited. Now often used to the rock adjacent to and below an ore or mineralised body or geological fault. Note that on steeply-dipping tabular ore or mineralised bodies the foot wall will be inclined nearer to the vertical than horizontal. |\nGrade | The proportion of a mineral within a rock or other material. For gold mineralisation this is usually reported as grams of gold per tonne of rock (g/t) |\ng/t | grams per tonne |\nHanging wall | Originally a miner\u2019s term to refer to the rock above the mineralised zone that they exploited. Now often used to refer to the rock adjacent to and above an ore or mineralised body or geological fault. Note that on steeply-dipping tabular ore or mineralised bodies the hanging wall will be inclined nearer to the vertical than horizontal. |\nIndicated Mineral Resource | That part of a Mineral Resource for which tonnage, densities, shape, physical characteristics, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a reasonable level of confidence. It is based on exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. The locations are too widely or inappropriately spaced to confirm geological and/or grade continuity but are spaced closely enough for continuity to be assumed. |\nInferred Mineral Resource | That part of a Mineral Resource for which tonnage, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a low level of confidence. It is inferred from geological evidence and assumed but not verified geological and/or grade continuity. It is based on information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that may be limited, or of uncertain quality and reliability. |\nIntercept | Refers to a sample or sequence of samples taken across the entire width or an ore body or mineralized zone. The intercept is described by the entire thickness and the average grade of mineralisation |\nIRR | The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is the discount rate that makes the net present value (NPV) of a project zero. In other words, it is the expected compound annual rate of return that will be earned on a project or investment |\nKt | Thousand tonnes |\nMineral Resource Estimate | A concentration or occurrence of material of economic interest in or on the Earth\u2019s crust in such a form, quality, and quantity that there are reasonable and realistic prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, continuity and other geological characteristics of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated from specific geological knowledge, or interpreted from a well constrained and portrayed geological model. |\nMineral Reserve | An \u2018Ore Reserve\u2019 is the economically mineable part of a Measured and/or Indicated Mineral Resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined. Appropriate assessments and studies have been carried out, and include consideration of and modification by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors. These assessments demonstrate at the time of reporting that extraction could reasonably be justified. Ore Reserves are sub-divided in order of increasing confidence into Probable Ore Reserves and Proved Ore Reserves. |\nNI 43-101 | Canadian National Instrument 43-101 a common standard for reporting of identified mineral resources and ore reserves |\nNPV | Net Present Value (NPV) is the value of all future cash flows (positive and negative) over the entire life of an investment discounted to the present. NPV analysis is a form of intrinsic valuation and is used extensively across finance and accounting for determining the value of a business, investment security, capital project, new venture, cost reduction program, and anything that involves cash flow. It is after deducting the upfront capital cost |\nOpen pit mining | A method of extracting minerals from the earth by excavating downwards from the surface such that the ore is extracted in the open air (as opposed to underground mining). |\nQuartz | A common rock mineral composed of the elements silicon and oxygen. |\nStockwork | Multiple connected veins with more than one orientation, typically consisting of millimetre to centimetre thick fracture-fill veins and veinlets. |\nStrike length | The longest horizontal dimension of an ore body or zone of mineralisation. |\nTrue width | The shortest axis of a body, usually perpendicular to the longest plane. This often has to be calculated for channel or drill samples where the sampling was not exactly perpendicular to the long axis. The true width will always be less than the apparent width of an obliquely intersect sample. |\nVein | A sheet-like body of crystallised minerals within a rock, generally forming in a discontinuity or crack between two rock masses. Economic concentrations of gold are often contained within vein minerals. |",

The DD component of the drilling program for NOA 1, NOA 2, NOA 4-6, and NOA 7/8 are pending.\nDifferential GPS techniques were used to survey all drill collar locations accurately. Downhole survey using gyroscopic method was undertaken for all drillholes and stored in the geological database.\nGeological logging for the Phase 2 drilling has been uploaded it onto the Company's central SQL geological database.\nSampling was carried out to Monument's protocols as per industry best practice. Quality control procedures adopted for all sub-sampling stages to maximize the representativeness of samples was to insert commercial certified reference material \u201cCRM\u201d for standards and blanks every 20 samples. The CRMs covered gold grade ranges expected at the Murchison Project.\nAll sample preparation and gold assaying of primary samples were undertaken by an independent commercial laboratory, ALS Geochemistry, in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. Samples were analyzed for gold by lead collection fire assay of a 50g charge with AAS finish.\nNOA 1\nBest results from the completed RC holes at NOA 1 include:\n-\n4m at 32.0g/t Au from 218m 1m at 1.1g/t Au from 226m (visible gold was sighted in RC chips associated with intercept \u2013 see Figure 1), 1m at 4.2g/t Au from 229m and 1m at 1.1g/t Au in 21BNRC050.\n-\nIncluding 1m at 71.8g/t Au from 219m\n-\n-\n2m at 5.3g/t Au from 140m in 21BNRC047\n-\n1m at 4.3g/t Au from 190m and 1.7g/t Au from 184m in 21BNRC048\n-\n1m at 1.2g/t Au from 240m in 21BNRC049\n-\n1m at 4.3g/t Au from 246m and 1m at 1.5g/t Au from 243m in 21BNRC052\nThe location of results from drill holes reported in this release is shown in the plan view in Figure 3 and the sectional view in Figure 4. The sectional view is a cross-section of 7010030N at the NOA 1 deposit with a clipping window of 50m on either side of the section line AA1 indicated on the plan view in Figure 3. The cross-sectional view shows significant intercepts of drilling reported in this release shown in yellow boxes and some previously reported drilling in white boxes. The interpreted broad mineralization within the target zone highlighted gold grades greater than 0.5g/t.\nHoles 21BNRC047, 21BNRC048, 21BNRC049, 21BNRC050, 21BNRC052 and 21BNRD051 (RC pre-collar with diamond tail) were drilled to target the deeper portions of the NOA 1 interpreted high-grade gold mineralization, where previous drillholes 16MRC107 and 20MRD013 had intersected 7m at 9.0g/t Au from 140m and 1m at 7.6g/t Au from 243m respectively (Figure 4). Gold mineralization within all drillholes is associated with sheared mafic-ultramafic rocks and quartz-carbonate veins with talc-carbonate alteration, accessory biotite, pyrite and minor arsenopyrite. In diamond drill core, the mineralized zones are visually distinctive due to the presence of millimeter to centimeter wide quartz-carbonate veins that are commonly folded and display yellow-brown talc-carbonate selvages.\nThe width and grade of the mineralization intercepted at depth beneath the historic pit in drill hole 21BNRC050 indicate continuity of mineralization at depth and remain open, greatly enhancing the NOA 1 underground target\u2019s potential to host significant gold mineralization beyond the existing Mineral Resource (Figure 4).\nThe results from the DD are expected to provide critical structural and geological information that will assist in evaluating the structural components of the various lithological units. Monument looks forward to updating the market with a more comprehensive announcement combining all the Phase 2 RC and DD results over the coming weeks when the DD results become available.\nFigure 4: NOA 1 cross-section 7010030N (AA1) +-50m looking North showing Phase 2 drilling completed, anomalous intercepts in recent RC drilling (yellow boxes) and some previously reported drilling (white boxes) is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/fd8c62d5-bad5-4961-b32c-9ee3ee5dfa3a\nNew Alliance\nOne RC hole was drilled at the New Alliance target, which has historically produced 30koz of gold from an open pit (Figures 2 and 5). This hole targeted the high-grade mineralization plunge interpreted beneath the northern end of the pit. Significant assay returned include 1m at 2.4g/t Au from 45m and 1m at 2.8g/t from 116m in 21BNRC054. This zone of interpreted gold mineralization at New Alliance remains open being mostly untested along strike and at depth. (Figure 5).\nDrillholes for this release are detailed in Appendices 1 and 2.\nFigure 5: Drill location plan at New Alliance target is available at https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/74be83cb-9ae2-4151-9315-52fa0fb94f83\nBACKGROUND OF MONUMENT MURCHISON PROJECT\nMonument\u2019s Murchison Gold Project comprises 170km2 of highly prospective Archean Greenstone.

That would be a very choppy and strong move, but I would not expect some type of massive momentum with it. This is a scenario where we would see a lot of back and forth, meaning that you should have plenty of time to buy on the dips if that does in fact be the case. You could make an argument for a bullish flag at the moment, but we need a breakout to the outside to see momentum carry gold higher. Underneath, the $1800 level continues to be the \u201cfloor\u201d in the market.\nGold Price Predictions Video 31.05.22\nFor a look at all of today\u2019s economic events, check out our economic calendar.\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\nMore From FXEMPIRE:\n-\nRussians, Ukrainians fight on outskirts of Sievierodonetsk, EU haggles over oil ban\n-\nBomb hits Russian-occupied Ukraine city of Melitopol \u2013 Russian, Ukraine officials\n-\nFed\u2019s Waller backs 50 bps rate hikes until \u201csubstantial\u201d reduction in inflation\n-\nErdogan tells Zelenskiy he values project to create sea route for agriculture exports",

Reverse circulation (RC) and diamond drillings have started at the beginning of the year 2022 with the objective of increasing the resources. A compilation of the geological work will be created and published during the third quarter.\nFinance:\nA higher grade (0.82 g/t compared to 0.76 g/t for the same period in 2021) and an increase in the average gold price ($2,365 per ounce compared to $2,281 for the same period in 2021) resulted in a 53% increase in the operating income and a 43% increase in cash flows from operating activities. While improving its cash flow, the Company continues debt reduction with a net cash position of $ 3.1 million on March 31, 2022, compared to $ 9.3 million on December 31, 2021.\nTransaction:\nThe Company continues its work to complete the pre-feasibility study for the Kiniero project in Guinea, perform accounting work, and integrate the Sycamore teams and procedures, in order to meet all preliminary conditions for completing of the transaction, with the objective of closing the transaction with Sycamore Mining Ltd before the end of the second quarter.\nMr. Georges Cohen, President of Robex, declared: \u201cA quarter with strong improvements across all metrics. I am thrilled to finally see the benefits of the investments and the teamwork done in 2021. Our financial balance sheet has been strengthened and allows us to consider our new growth phase from a strong position, with the exploration of our properties and our new development project in Guinea.\u201d\nFirst Quarter of 2022 Operating and Financial Results Highlights\nQuarters ended March 31,\n2022\n2021\nVariation\nGold ounces produced\n12,089\n10,642\n+14%\nGold ounces sold\n13,671\n11,502\n+19%\n(rounded off to the nearest thousand dollars)\nRevenue \u2013 Gold sales\n32,333,000\n26,241,000\n+23%\nOperating income\n15,363,000\n10,035,000\n+53%\nNet income attributable to equity shareholders\n12,505,000\n9,710,000\n+29%\nBasic earnings per share\n0.021\n0.016\n+29%\nDiluted earnings per share\n0.021\n0.016\n+29%\nAdjusted amounts\nNet income attributable to equity shareholdersi\n12,394,000\n9,604,000\n+29%\nPer sharei\n0.021\n0.016\n+29%\nCash flows\nCash flows from operating activitiesii\n16,481,000\n11,526,000\n+43%\nPer sharei\n0.027\n0.019\n+43%\nStatistics\n(in dollars)\nAverage realized selling price (per ounce)\n2,365\n2,281\n+4%\nAll-in sustaining cost (per ounce sold)i\n1,166\n1,732\n-33%\nAdjusted all-in sustaining cost (per ounce sold)i iii\n851\n1,053\n-19%\nAs of March 31, 2022\nAs of December 31, 2021\nVariation\nTotal assets\n137,074,000\n142,668,000\n-4%\nTotal liabilities\n29,311,000\n44,020,000\n-33%\nNet debt (cash)iv\n(3,074,000\n)\n(9,281,000\n)\n-66%\nMining Operations (Gold):\nQuarters ended March 31,\n2022\n2021\nOperating Data\nOre mined (tonnes)\n638,772\n477,350\nOre processed (tonnes)\n509,374\n472,410\nWaste mined (tonnes)\n2,074,601\n2,720,038\nOperational stripping ratio\n3.2\n5.7\nHead grade (g/t)\n0.82\n0.76\nRecovery\n90.1%\n92.8%\nGold ounces produced\n12,089\n10,642\nGold ounces sold\n13,671\n11,502\nFinancial Data\n(rounded off to the nearest thousand dollars)\nRevenue \u2013 Gold sales\n32,333,000\n26,241,000\nMining operation expenses\n(8,934,000\n)\n(9,188,000\n)\nMining royalties\n(1,002,000\n)\n(656,000\n)\nAdministrative expenses\n(3,178,000\n)\n(2,244,000\n)\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets\n(2,443,000\n)\n(2,632,000\n)\nSegment operating income\n16,776,000\n11,521,000\nStatistics\n(in dollars)\nAverage realized selling price (per ounce)\n2,365\n2,281\nCash operating cost (per tonne processed)i\n17\n18\nTotal cash cost (per ounce sold)i\n727\n856\nAll-in sustaining cost (per ounce sold)i\n1,166\n1,732\nAdjusted all-in sustaining cost (per ounce sold)i iii\n851\n1,053\nAdministrative expenses (per ounce sold)\n232\n195\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets (per ounce sold)\n179\n229\nFor more information, Robex\u2019s MD&A and the consolidated financial statements are available on the Company's website in the Investors section at robexgold.com.

(TSX:YRI; NYSE:AUY; LSE:AUY) (\u201cYamana\u201d), today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement (the \u201cArrangement Agreement\u201d), under which Gold Fields will acquire all of the outstanding common shares of Yamana (\u201cYamana Shares\u201d) pursuant to a plan of arrangement (the \u201cTransaction\u201d).\nUnder the terms of the Transaction, all of the outstanding Yamana Shares will be exchanged at a ratio of 0.6 of an ordinary share in Gold Fields (each whole share, a \u201cGold Fields Share\u201d) or 0.6 of a Gold Fields American depositary share (each whole American depositary share, a \u201cGold Fields ADS\u201d) for each Yamana Share (the \u201cExchange Ratio\u201d).\nThe Transaction implies a valuation for Yamana of US$6.7 billion and represents a premium of 33.8% to the 10-day Volume-Weighted Average Price (\u201cVWAP\u201d) of Yamana\u2019s Shares of US$ 5.201 on Friday, May 27, 2022, being the last trading day on the NYSE prior to the date of this announcement, based on the 10-day VWAP of Gold Fields ADSs of US$ 11.592. Upon closing of the Transaction, it is anticipated that Gold Fields Shareholders and Yamana Shareholders will own approximately 61% and 39% of the Combined Group, respectively.\nThe acquisition of Yamana by Gold Fields significantly strengthens the ability of the combined company (the \u201cCombined Group\u201d) to deliver on Gold Fields\u2019 three strategic pillars: maximizing asset potential; advancing ESG commitment; and growing the value and quality of its asset portfolio. The Combined Group has the potential to create significant long-term value for shareholders through greater scale, an industry-leading portfolio of assets, an enhanced production profile with significant growth potential, operational and geological synergies, and a strengthened financial profile for future growth and shareholder returns.\nGold Fields\u2019 Board believes that offering the Gold Fields Consideration Shares is the best way to capture and unlock growth opportunities while still maintaining financial flexibility, capital and operational discipline, and providing attractive returns to shareholders. Strong near-term operating cash flows from Gold Fields\u2019 producing assets complement the manageable capital requirements of Yamana\u2019s world class, high return project portfolio, providing greater capacity to fund the combined growth pipeline internally, while maintaining shareholder returns in line with Gold Fields\u2019 existing policy.\n-\nAs traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)\n-\nAs traded on the NYSE\nYamana is a natural strategic fit for Gold Fields, with its high quality, diversified portfolio of long life assets located in mining friendly rules-based jurisdictions across the Americas (including its five producing mines and pipeline of development projects and exploration properties) and with a shared focus on health and safety and ESG performance.\nWith the combination of Gold Fields\u2019 and Yamana\u2019s portfolio of assets, Gold Fields will become a new global gold major able to create value at every stage of its pipeline.\nThe Combined Group will maintain its presence in all regions while continuing to honour commitments to stakeholders. Gold Fields believes that this Transaction offers employees and communities more opportunities in the long-term given its track record of ongoing investment in the regions in which it operates.\nThe Transaction has been unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of both Gold Fields and Yamana and is expected to close in the second half of 2022 subject to and following the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the Transaction. Gold Fields will remain headquartered in Johannesburg.\nThe acquisition will be implemented by way of a plan of arrangement of Yamana under the Canada Business Corporations Act (\u201cCBCA\u201d) pursuant to the Arrangement Agreement entered into between Gold Fields and Yamana dated 31 May 2022. The consideration payable (the \u201cTransaction Consideration\u201d) to the shareholders of Yamana will consist of either, at the election of a Yamana shareholder, newly issued Gold Fields Shares or newly issued Gold Fields ADSs, which each represent one Gold Fields Share, in accordance with the Exchange Ratio. The Gold Fields Shares are listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (\u201cJSE\u201d) and the Gold Fields ADSs are listed on the NYSE.\nChris Griffith, Chief Executive Officer of Gold Fields said: \u201cToday we are announcing the acquisition by Gold Fields of Yamana, two companies with complementary portfolios, cultures and strategic priorities. The result is a combination with much greater capacity and potential value than the sum of its parts. Each company brings with it a unique set of skills and geological knowledge, enabling the Combined Group to enhance its assets more efficiently over the long-term than they could as separate companies.\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement is the result of a robust and extensive process carried out by the Gold Fields\u2019 Board and management team to identify the optimum solution to support our revised strategy. Yamana\u2019s high-quality asset base in the Americas and strong development and exploration pipeline will further diversify the geography of our portfolio, creating a top-4 global gold major, well positioned to deliver long-term value creation. Combined, Gold Fields will boast an industry leading portfolio of high-quality, long-life flagship assets that span some of the world\u2019s most established gold mining jurisdictions.\n\u201cLike Gold Fields, Yamana is focused on operational delivery, disciplined capital allocation, portfolio management, maximising shareholder returns, and upholding leading sustainability, safety and ESG performance. These shared priorities are foundational to this Transaction.\u201d\nPeter Marrone, Executive Chairman of Yamana Gold said: \u201cThis is an outstanding opportunity for our shareholders, employees and the local communities in which we operate throughout the Americas. The Transaction delivers an immediate and compelling premium for Yamana Shareholders, reflecting the inherent fair value of our assets, while also offering an opportunity to benefit from the creation of a new global gold producer with an attractive value proposition.\n\u201cWe saw significant merit in pursuing discussions with Gold Fields because of the quality of their company on a standalone basis and because of the quality a combination would create. After many months of discussions and conduct of diligence, including site diligence, over a period beginning late last year, we felt even more certain in our premise that Gold Fields was a high-quality standalone company and the company resulting from the combination would be even better. We were also encouraged and influenced by Gold Fields\u2019 conclusions, after their extensive diligence, of what was our inherent, fair value.\n\u201cThe combination of Yamana and Gold Fields creates a world-class, globally diversified company with regional relevance across premier, rules-based mining jurisdictions that is underpinned by low cost, long life mines. The combined entity will be well positioned to deliver long-term value creation with its enhanced scale, management strength and improved capital markets profile. Yamana and Gold Fields also have complementary corporate cultures and values with an ESG-first operating model with a strong focus on supporting host communities and environmental stewardship.\n\u201cWe believe that Yamana's shareholders\u2019 ownership of the Combined Group reflects the fair value of the contribution that each company brings.\u201d\nStrategic Rationale for Gold Fields\nThe Transaction has a compelling strategic rationale and is expected to provide considerable benefits to the shareholders of Gold Fields (\u201cGold Fields Shareholders\u201d), shareholders of Yamana (\u201cYamana Shareholders\u201d) and the Combined Group\u2019s employees and stakeholders. The Transaction will bring together two highly complementary gold portfolios with an enhanced long-term value proposition, centred around:\n-\nGrowing the value and quality of our portfolio of assets with an industry-leading combined portfolio of high-quality assets comparing favourably to the scale, cost and life of the premium-rated majors, and an appropriate balance of existing production with future growth;\n-\nEnhanced geographical diversification with a combined portfolio of high-quality assets across the world\u2019s premier mining jurisdictions in South Africa, Ghana, Australia, Canada, and South America, with risk mitigated through a balanced geographical spread and majority exposure to OECD countries;\n-\nStrengthened financial position driven by Gold Fields and Yamana\u2019s highly complementary cash flow generation profiles with strong near-term operating cash flows from producing assets, healthy balance sheets and staggered major capital investment cycles providing the Combined Group with greater capacity to fund its project pipeline without compromising balance sheet flexibility or shareholder returns;\n-\nIndustry-leading growth pipeline combining Gold Fields\u2019 track record in portfolio optimisation and project development with Yamana\u2019s current assets and deep pipeline with accelerated growth potential. The Combined Group will benefit from the near-term growth of Gold Fields\u2019 Salares Norte and South Deep mines, and longer-term growth from Yamana\u2019s Wasamac, Malartic Odyssey and MARA projects as well as additional opportunities in Yamana\u2019s high-quality exploration pipeline;\n-\nComplementary cultures and aligned strategic priorities with shared values as disciplined, value-driven companies focused on operational delivery, capital allocation, portfolio management, responsible growth and shareholder returns underpinned by a strong focus on people, particularly their safety, and upholding leading sustainability and ESG performance. The Combined Group will continue to commit to Gold Fields\u2019 2030 decarbonisation, environmental, safety and health, diversity and stakeholder value creation targets; and\n-\nInitial target pre-tax synergies of approximately US$40 million per year anchored in operational integration, as well as potential financing synergies and a streamlining of overhead cost structures.\nStrategic Rationale for Yamana\nFor shareholders of Yamana, the Transaction presents compelling rationale including:\n-\nCompany scale with Yamana Shareholders retaining approximately 39% ownership in the combined top tier, globally diversified, senior gold producer, ranked highest by reserve life index relative to senior gold peers, third largest by gold production in 2024, and fourth largest by market capitalization;\n-\nInternational presence and regional relevance with 14 mines providing regional relevance across premier, rules-based mining jurisdictions including North America, South America, Africa and Australia;\n-\nManagement strength with the Combined Group offering Yamana Shareholders industry leading management bench strength which shares the philosophy of managing regionally dominant platforms. Gold Fields\u2019 management provides significant experience in certain geologies such as paleo placer deposits which could unlock the full value of the Jacobina gold belt in addition to significant experience in advancing projects which will be of strategic significance in the advancement of Yamana\u2019s portfolio of world class development assets;\n-\nEnhanced capitalized position along with exposure to significant near-term production and cash flow growth from Gold Fields\u2019 portfolio, improving the ability to deliver a leading growth profile through Yamana\u2019s high return, project pipeline including MARA, Odyssey, Wasamac, Jacobina\u2019s phased expansion in addition to further opportunities throughout the portfolio;\n-\nRealization of inherent fair value, crystallizing value for Yamana Shareholders while allowing for upside appreciation from further growth and the potential re-rating of the combined portfolio.\nBoard of Directors\u2019 Recommendations\nGold Fields has engaged financial and legal advisors, which are listed below.

The 2021 drilling program consisted of 54 holes for a total of 18,632 metres. Earlier results were reported on December 2, 2021 (73.5 g/t Au over 1.35 m), October 20, 2021 (3.93 g/t Au over 5.45 m), June 22, 2021 (70.8 g/t Au over 0.4 m) and March 22, 2021 (8.46 g/t Au over 13.8 m).\nThe results from the last 13 holes show several high-grade intersections, including 19.12 g/t Au over 1.9 m, 41.0 g/t Au over 0.5 m, 11.9 g/t Au over 1.5 m and 16.7 g/t Au over 0.89 m. The three best intersections are located along the northeastern extension of the current resource envelope (Figure 1). All significant assay results are provided in Table 2.\nThe 2021 drilling program was a surface program aimed at continuing to expand the McKenzie Break gold deposit and supplementing the recent mineral resource estimate (the \u201c2021 MRE\u201d, effective February 1, 2021 and amended October 14, 2021, available on the Corporation\u2019s website) with holes drilled on 50-metre centres down to a vertical depth of 400 metres. Based on recent results outside the 2021 MRE envelope, the current program has succeeded in expanding the gently dipping deposit, particularly to the northeast. The mineralized footprint now measures 600 metres by 1,100 metres and has been tested to a vertical depth of up to 400 metres. The 2021 program also confirmed that the mineralization is continuous and remains open in all directions.\nThe 2022 drilling program on the McKenzie Break property, which began in April with one drill rig, consists of 20,000 metres of drilling in 65 holes. A second drill rig will be added once Monarch\u2019s Swanson 10,000-metre drilling program is complete. Monarch will continue testing the deposit with holes at 50-metre centres. The 2022 program is aimed at expanding the current underground resource to the north and east, increasing the size of the currently proposed resource pit shell up-dip through expansion to the south and west and testing additional exploration targets along the volcanic-intrusive contact to the south.\nLater this year, Monarch will update the mineral resource estimate to include the additional 18,632 metres drilled in 2021 and several strategic holes to be drilled in 2022, as well as a new interpreted geological model.\n\u201cMcKenzie Break continues to show strong exploration potential in all directions as we continue to encounter high-grade gold mineralization,\u201d said Jean-Marc Lacoste, President and Chief Executive Officer of Monarch. \u201cWe expect 2022 to be another busy year on McKenzie Break and are looking forward to the results of the updated mineral resource estimate later in the year.\u201d\nAbout McKenzie Break Gold mineralization occurs in an elongated diorite unit or lens within a shallow embayment of the Pascalis Batholith. Monarch continues to have drilling success beyond the limits of the current resource envelope, recently updated by Geologica and GoldMinds (effective February 1, 2021, and amended October 14, 2021, available on the Corporation\u2019s website) (see Table 1). The mineralized envelope currently measures 1,100 metres by 600 metres and has been tested down to a vertical depth of 400 metres. In 2022, the Corporation will drill 20,000 metres to continue testing the limits of the defined pit shell and mineralized envelope and to test other priority targets on the property, including targets along the volcanic-intrusive contact to the south. The 2022 drilling program began in April with one drill rig, with a second rig to be added later in the year.\nTable 1: 2021 mineral resource estimate for the McKenzie Break deposit\nArea (cut-off grade)\nIndicated resource\nInferred resource\nTonnes (t)\nGrade (g/t)\nOunces (Au)\nTonnes (t)\nGrade (g/t)\nOunces (Au)\nPit-constrained (0.50 g/t Au)\n1,441,377\n1.80\n83,305\n2,243,562\n1.44\n104,038\nUnderground (2.38 g/t Au)\n387,720\n5.03\n62,677\n1,083,503\n4.21\n146,555\nTOTAL\n1,829,097\n145,982\n3,327,065\n250,593\nMineral resource estimate notes:\nMineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. An Inferred Mineral Resource has a lower level of confidence than that applying to a Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource and must not be converted to a Mineral Reserve. The estimate of mineral resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, market or other relevant issues. The quantity and grade of reported inferred resources are uncertain in nature and there has not been sufficient work to define these inferred resources as indicated or measured resources.\nThe database used for this mineral estimate includes drill results obtained from historical records and up to the recent 2018-2020 drill program.\nMineral resources are reported at a cut-off grade of 0.50 g/t Au for the pit-constrained and underground mineral resources are reported at a cut-off grade of 2.38 g/t Au within reasonably mineable volumes.\nThese cut-offs were calculated at a gold price of C$1,980 ounce.\nThe pit-constrained resources were based on the following parameters: mining cost $3.5/t, processing, transportation + G&A costs $27/t, Au recovery 95%, pit slopes 15 degrees for overburden and 50 degrees for rock.\nThe underground reasonably mineable volumes were based on the following parameters: mining cost $98/t, processing, transportation + G&A costs $27/t, Au recovery 95%, dilution of 15% at 0 g/t Au with a minimum stope dimension of 10m x 10m x 5m.\nThe geological interpretation of the deposits was based on lithologies and the typical mineralized interval mainly composed by diorite hosted shear zones.\nThe mineral resource presented here was estimated with a block size of 5m x 5m x 5m for the pit-constrained and for underground.\nThe blocks were interpolated from equal length composites calculated from the mineralized intervals. Prior to compositing, high-grade gold assays were capped to 60 g/t Au applied on 0.6-metre composites.\nThe mineral estimation was completed using the inverse distance squared methodology utilizing two passes. For each pass, search ellipsoids followed the geological interpretation trends were used.\nTonnage estimates are based on rock specific gravity of 2.77 tonnes per cubic metre for all the zones. Results are presented undiluted and in situ.\nEstimates use metric units (metres, tonnes and g/t). Metal contents are presented in troy ounces (metric tonne x grade / 31.10348).\nThis mineral resource estimate is dated February 11th, 2021, and with an amended date of October 14th, 2021. The effective date for the drillhole database used to produce this updated mineral resource estimate is February 1st, 2021. Tonnages and ounces in the tables are rounded to the nearest hundred.

Tokosea is a new greenfield discovery at Enchi where first pass drilling has highlighted the strong potential to delineate additional resources across the 216 km2 land package at Enchi.\nHighlights from Drilling at Tokosea\nDrilling on the southern end of the Tokosea trend intersected multiple structures and has extended the drill tested gold mineralization 100 metres to the south:\nHole TORC057 intersected mineralization in both the near surface oxides and upper portions of the sulphides. Near surface the hole intersected 1.29 g/t Au over 13.0 m from 42 m. Within the upper sulphides the hole intersected 0.48 g/t Au over 32.0 m from 106 m, including 1.06 g/t Au over 7.0 m from 108 m.\nDrilling on the central portion of the main trend at Tokosea extended the zone to depth, as well as up- and down- dip from prior drill tested mineralization:\nHole TORC081 intersected 1.64 g/t Au over 10.0 m from 158 m.\nHole TORC077 intersected 2.11 g/t Au over 7.0 m from 71 m.\nHole TORC070 intersected 1.73 g/t Au over 8.0 m from 28 m and 1.62 g/t Au over 2.0 m from 78 m.\nDrilling on a sub-parallel structure at Tokosea intersected gold mineralization within the near-surface oxidized zone, including:\nHole TORC063 intersected 1.34 g/t Au over 8.0 m from 10 m.\nStrong results from drilling at Tokosea, a new greenfield discovery at Enchi, continue to highlight the potential for mineral resource growth at Enchi:\nThis drilling was completed as part of the first pass discovery drilling completed at Tokosea in 2022, with prior results announced March 7, 2022 and April 20, 2022.\nTokosea is outlined on surface by a six-kilometre-long and two-to-three-kilometre-wide gold-in-soil anomaly. Previous drill intercepts at Tokosea include: 1.80 g/t Au over 27.0 m from 30 m including 4.13 g/t Au over 3.0 m from 31 m in TORC045, and 1.67 g/t Au over 17.0 m from 131 m including 18.17 g/t Au over 1.0 m from 131 m in TORC032 (see Newcore\u2019s April 20, 2022 news release).\nGreg Smith, VP Exploration of Newcore stated, \"We are excited by the results we have achieved from our inaugural drill program at Tokosea. Only 82 holes have been drilled on the target, with drilling testing mineralization to an average vertical depth of only 75 metres. First pass drilling at Tokosea focused on testing shallow gold mineralization within the oxides and upper portion of the sulphides, with the target remaining open along strike and at depth and only a small portion of the anomaly tested to date. These results expand this new discovery at Enchi and confirm the potential for resource growth across the Project, a district scale property located on a prolific gold belt that hosts a number of multi-million-ounce gold mines.\"\nThis news release reports results for 26 RC holes totalling 3,501 m (TORC057 to TORC082) targeting the Tokosea Gold Target. 20 of the 26 holes intersected gold mineralization.\nSelect assay results from the 26 holes of the drill program reported in this release are below:\nTable 1 - Enchi Gold Project Drill Highlights\nHole ID\nZone/Deposit\nFrom (m)\nTo (m)\nLength (m)\nAu (g/t)\nTORC057\nTokosea\n42.0\n55.0\n13.0\n1.29\nand\n106.0\n138.0\n32.0\n0.48\nincluding\n108.0\n115.0\n7.0\n1.06\nTORC081\nTokosea\n158.0\n168.0\n10.0\n1.64\nTORC077\nTokosea\n71.0\n78.0\n7.0\n2.11\nTORC070\nTokosea\n28.0\n36.0\n8.0\n1.73\nand\n78.0\n80.0\n2.0\n1.62\nTORC063\nTokosea\n10.0\n18.0\n8.0\n1.34\nTORC080\nTokosea\n84.0\n113.0\n29.0\n0.35\nincluding\n85.0\n91.0\n6.0\n0.53\nNotes:\n1.

Tokosea is outlined on surface by a six-kilometre-long and two-to-three-kilometre-wide gold-in-soil anomaly.\nDrilling on the southern end of the Tokosea trend has now expanded the gold mineralization defined on the main structure, intersecting multiple zones in the oxides and upper portion of the sulphides. Hole TORC057 intersected a near surface structure with 1.29 g/t Au over 13.0 m from 42 m in the oxides, and a deeper structure in the sulphides with 0.48 g/t Au over 32.0 m from 106 m, including 1.06 g/t Au over 7.0 m from 108 m extending the drill tested gold mineralization 100 metres to the south.\nDrilling on the central portion of the main structure at Tokosea, 1.5 kilometres northeast of hole TORC057, extended the main mineralized zone up- and down- dip from the previously drill tested zone. Hole TORC081 extended mineralization on the central portion of the main structure by 100 metres to the south, intersecting 1.64 g/t Au over 10.0 m from 158 m. Hole TORC070, collared 400 metres north of TORC081, intersected an upper mineralized zone in the oxides with 1.73 g/t Au over 8.0 m from 28 m, and 1.62 g/t Au over 2.0 m from 78 m in the sulphides. Hole TORC077, 100 metres north of TORC081, intersected 2.11 g/t Au over 7.0 m from 71 m.\nA series of holes at Tokosea also tested a sub-parallel zone located approximately 350 metres west of the main structure. Drilling intersected additional gold mineralization within the near-surface oxidized zone and upper portion of the sulphide zone. Hole TORC063 tested the central portion of the sub-parallel structure and intersected 1.34 g/t Au over 8.0 m from 10 m within the oxides. Hole TORC080 intersected a broad zone of gold mineralization in the sulphides with 0.35 g/t Au over 29.0 m from 84 m, including 0.53 g/t Au over 6.0 m from 85 m. Hole TORC065 intersected two gold zones in the oxides with an upper mineralized zone of 0.31 g/t Au over 19.0 m from 24 m, and a second zone with 0.81 g/t Au over 4.0 m from 57 m.\nFirst pass drilling at Tokosea now consists of 82 RC holes totalling 10,238 m (TORC001 to TORC082) designed to test gold-in-soil and trench anomalies. The wide spaced and shallow drilling tested several targets within a four-kilometre-by-two-kilometre area, with 68 of the 82 holes intersecting gold mineralization.\nEnchi Gold Project Mineral Resource Estimate\nThe Enchi Gold Project hosts a pit constrained Inferred Mineral Resource of 70.4 million tonnes grading 0.62 g/t Au containing 1.41 million ounces gold (see Newcore news release dated June 8, 2021). Mineral resource estimation practices are in accordance with CIM Estimation of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Best Practice Guidelines (November 29, 2019) and follow CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (May 10, 2014), that are incorporated by reference into National Instrument 43-101 (\"NI 43-101\"). The Mineral Resource Estimate was prepared by independent qualified person Todd McCracken, P. Geo. of BBA E&C Inc. The technical report, titled \"Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Enchi Gold Project, Enchi, Ghana\" has an effective date of June 8, 2021, and is available under the Company\u2019s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.\n2020 - 2022 Enchi Drilling Program\nA 90,000 metre discovery and resource expansion drilling program is underway at Enchi (anticipated completion in Q2 2022). The program includes both RC and diamond drilling and includes the first deeper drilling on the Project. Newcore\u2019s multi-pronged exploration approach has delivered on the goals set out at the start of drilling: (i) successfully outlined potential resource growth along strike at all four existing deposits (Sewum, Boin, Nyam, Kwakyekrom); (ii) encountered strong results at previously drilled zones that are outside of the resource area (Kojina Hill and Eradi); (iii) drilling intersected high-grade at depth which has outlined the potential for underground resources; and (iv) identified new discoveries from successful first pass drilling on early stage kilometre-scale gold-in-soil anomalous targets (Sewum South, Tokosea). For the total planned 90,000 metre drill program, assay results have now been received and released for 549 holes representing 86,565 metres.\nTokosea Gold Target\nThe Tokosea Target is located in the central portion of the Enchi Gold Project and is one of the largest anomalous areas with gold-in-soil and associated geophysical anomalies. Tokosea is located 15 kilometres southeast of the town of Enchi, with nearby roads and power and further access provided by a series of drill roads. Tokosea is outlined on surface by a six-kilometre-long and two-to-three-kilometre-wide gold-in-soil anomaly. An airborne geophysical anomaly coincident with the area defines a series of sub-parallel and intersecting structures. Historic artisanal small scale open pit and underground mining has occurred on individual structures dating as far back as the early 20th century. The area was untested by drilling prior to the current drill program. 82 RC holes totalling 10,238 metres were completed and released as part of the current drill program.\nNewcore is committed to best practice standards for all exploration, sampling and drilling activities. Drilling was completed by an independent drilling firm using industry standard RC and Diamond Drill equipment. Analytical quality assurance and quality control procedures include the systematic insertion of blanks, standards and duplicates into the sample strings. Samples are placed in sealed bags and shipped directly to Intertek Labs located in Tarkwa, Ghana for 50 gram gold fire assay.\nQualified Person\nMr. Gregory Smith, P. Geo, Vice President of Exploration at Newcore, is a Qualified Person as defined by NI 43-101, and has reviewed and approved the technical data and information contained in this news release. Mr. Smith has verified the technical and scientific data disclosed herein and has conducted appropriate verification on the underlying data including confirmation of the drillhole data files against the original drillhole logs and assay certificates.\nAbout Newcore Gold Ltd.\nNewcore Gold is advancing its Enchi Gold Project located in Ghana, Africa\u2019s largest gold producer (1). The Project currently hosts an Inferred Mineral Resource of 1.41 million ounces of gold at 0.62 g/t (2). Newcore Gold offers investors a unique combination of top-tier leadership, who are aligned with shareholders through their 27% equity ownership, and prime district scale exploration opportunities. Enchi\u2019s 216 km2 land package covers 40 kilometres of Ghana\u2019s prolific Bibiani Shear Zone, a gold belt which hosts several 5 million-ounce gold deposits, including Kinross\u2019 Chirano mine 50 kilometers to the north. Newcore\u2019s vision is to build a responsive, creative and powerful gold enterprise that maximizes returns for shareholders.\nOn Behalf of the Board of Directors of Newcore Gold Ltd.\nLuke Alexander President, CEO & Director\nFor further information, please contact:\nMal Karwowska | Vice President, Corporate Development and Investor Relations +1 604 484 4399 info@newcoregold.com www.newcoregold.com\n(1) Source: Production volumes for 2020 as sourced from the World Gold Council\n(2) Notes for Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate:\n1. CIM definition standards were followed for the resource estimate. 2. The 2021 resource models used ordinary kriging (OK) grade estimation within a three-dimensional block model with mineralized zones defined by wireframed solids and constrained by pits shell for Sewum, Boin and Nyam. Kwakyekrom used Inverse Distance squared (ID2). 3. A base cut-off grade of 0.2 g/t Au was used with a capping of gold grades varied by deposit and zone. 4. A US$1,650/ounce gold price, open pit with heap leach operation was used to determine the cut-off grade of 0.2 g/t Au. Mining costs of US$1.40 for oxides, US$2.10 for transition, and US$2.60 for fresh rock per mined tonne and G&A and milling costs of US$6.83/milled tonne. The Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate is pit constrained. 5. Metallurgical recoveries have been applied to four individual deposits and in each case three material types (oxide, transition, and fresh rock) with average recoveries of 77% for Sewum, 79% for Boin, 60% for Nyam and 72% for Kwakyekrom. 6. A density of 2.20 g/cm3 for oxide, 2.45 g/cm3 for transition, and 2.70 g/cm3 for fresh rock was applied. 7. Optimization pit slope angles varied based on the rock types. 8. Mineral Resources that are not mineral reserves do not have economic viability. Numbers may not add due to rounding. 9.

(TSX: MSA), (CB: MINEROS) (\"Mineros\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to report an initial mineral resource estimate on Luna Roja, a gold skarn deposit forming part of its Hemco Property in Nicaragua (Figure 1).\nLuna Roja is located in Nicaragua's Golden Triangle, centered around the towns of Bonanza, Rosita and Siuna in northeastern Nicaragua. The Golden Triangle is the economically most significant mining region in the country, with an estimated 5 million ounces of gold produced since the nineteenth century, including over 1.3 million ounces of gold produced from the Hemco Property since 1993.\n\"We are pleased to have achieved this step at Luna Roja, one of several key targets in our pipeline of organic growth projects,\" said Andr\u00e9s Restrepo, President and CEO of Mineros. \"We are advancing Luna Roja and other early to advanced-stage targets throughout our highly prospective Hemco Property landholdings. Going forward, we will continue to explore Luna Roja, with the objective of adding to and upgrading this initial mineral resource,\" continued Mr. Restrepo.\nTable 1.

Drilling in 2021 focused primarily on confirming the tenor of gold mineralization in the main outcropping skarn body in the northwest part of the Deposit, and informing an initial mineral resource. An approximately 450 m long by 80 m wide by 250 m deep mineralized trend was delineated defining the Deposit, which is open laterally toward the southeast and at depth. Holes were irregularly spaced in the initial 2019-2020 drill campaign, with the objective of target delineation. The 2021 follow-up drill program focused on a 100 m by 50 m regular grid to refine the geological interpretation. The core of the mineralized skarn was drilled at approximately 25 m to 50 m spacing.\nThe initial mineral resource estimate announced herein includes the results of 9,607 m in 59 diamond drill holes completed between May 2019 and November 2021, as well as the results of 258 m in 101 channel samples. The initial mineral resource estimate was prepared using a 5 m by 5 m by 5 m block model constrained with 3D wireframes of the principal mineralized domains. Values for gold were interpolated into blocks using inverse distance squared. Definitions for resource categories used in this release are consistent with those defined by CIM (2014) and adopted by NI 43-101. Classification solids were created based on drill hole spacing where an average distance of 0 m to 30 m was categorized as indicated resources and 30 m to 60 m as inferred resources.\nThe open pit mineral resource is contained within an optimized pit shell and the underground mineral resource is reported within constraining volumes (Figure 2).\nA Whittle open pit optimization algorithm was run on the block model to constrain the resource with 45\u00b0 pit wall slopes and a long term gold price of US$1,700 per ounce. In addition to the mineralization contained within the optimized pit shell, an initial underground resource has been included below the pit, reported within constraining volumes, built around continuous blocks above a cut-off grade of 2.0 g/t Au, and considering a minimum thickness of 2 m.\nGold mineralization at Luna Roja is hosted within skarns associated primarily with selective replacement of carbonate rocks of the Cretaceous Metap\u00e1n Formation. Luna Roja mineralization is hosted in red-brown-yellow garnet, magnetite and hematite skarn, green-yellow garnet-pyroxene skarn. Bleached or gray marble and hornfels also occur in the Deposit and several intrusive phases have been delineated.\nThere are no known legal, political, environmental, or other risks that could materially affect the potential development of the mineral resources at the Luna Roja Deposit.\nQUALITY ASSURANCE, QUALITY CONTROL, AND DATA VERIFICATION\nMineros has implemented a quality assurance/quality control (\"QA/QC\") program aligned with industry best practices, in which certified reference materials (\"standards\"), duplicates and blanks are routinely inserted into the sample stream to assess precision, accuracy, contamination and bias. All standards, duplicates and blanks are validated and any batches that fail QA/QC are reanalyzed.\nDiamond drill core samples are selected by the geologists on site; sample intervals are typically 1 m in length, but can range from a minimum of 0.2 m to a maximum of 2 m. HTW-diameter diamond drill core to be sampled is cut in half lengthwise, with one half of the core stored on-site in wooden core boxes and the other half sent to the Bureau Veritas Commodities Canada Ltd. (\"Bureau Veritas\") laboratory in Managua, Nicaragua for sample preparation, then to the Bureau Veritas laboratory in Vancouver, Canada for geochemical analysis. Bureau Veritas is independent of Mineros.\nThe materials sent for sample preparation and analysis are packed by Mineros geologists in plastic bags with tamper-proof seals, with a chain of custody procedure for delivery to Bureau Veritas. Sample preparation is carried out following the PREP70-250 package (crushing of the entire sample to >= 70% passing 2 mm mesh, pulverization of 250 grams >= 85% 75 \u00b5m).\nGeochemical analysis is certified by Standards Council of Canada (\"SCC\") Standard ISO/IEC 17025:2017 with validation date until 2023-10-07. Samples, standards, duplicates and blanks are analyzed for gold using a standard fire assay method (30 g aliquot) and atomic absorption finish (AAS). Those over 10 ppm are reanalyzed by 30 g fire assay with gravimetric finish. All samples are analyzed for a 45-element suite, run with a 4-acid digestion and an ICP-ES/MS finish. All coarse rejects and pulps are returned by the laboratory and stored by the Company in a secure warehouse. Pulps from 5% of the materials analyzed are sent to a certified secondary laboratory, ALS Chemex, in Medell\u00edn, Colombia, to be analyzed using methods analogous to those used at Bureau Veritas. ALS Chemex is independent of Mineros.\nNEXT STEPS\nThe evaluation and analysis of the geological and drill data collected to date has identified several other areas with potential for additional zones of mineralization at depth and/or along the extension of the main skarn body towards the southeast, coincident with geophysical anomalies that resulted from a ground magnetometer survey conducted in 2020, which indicate the potential for the extension of the mineralized system under sedimentary cover. In addition, the Deposit has both a mineral assemblage and a geochemical signature associated with a distal skarn, hence the potential for nearby proximal endoskarn mineralization.\nA 3,000 m diamond drill campaign is planned for the second half of 2022. This campaign will include a series of short, near-surface drill holes into the Deposit, designed to increase the confidence level in areas previously tested with channel samples, as well as an initial drill test of three geophysical anomalies. The three geophysical anomalies are located east to southwest of the Deposit. The first anomaly is located to the southeast along the strike of the main body and covers an area of approximately 600 m by 130 m. The second anomaly is to the east of the Deposit and covers an area of approximately 900 m by 100 m. The third anomaly to the southwest covers an area of approximately 400 m by 350 m.\nAdditional work on the Deposit in the second half of 2022 will include relogging of drill core, refinement of the geological model, reinterpretation of geophysical data collected in 2020, additional mapping and surficial sampling. Once this work has been completed, the Company plans to conduct additional drill testing in 2023 focused on testing the extension of the mineralization laterally and to depth, the continuity of the underground mineral resource, and expanding and upgrading the initial mineral resource, as well as metallurgical testing.\nABOUT THE HEMCO PROPERTY\nThe Hemco Property was acquired by Mineros in 2013. It is located in northeastern Nicaragua in the Golden Triangle in the vicinity of the town of Bonanza, approximately 230 km northeast of the capital of Managua. The Hemco Property includes the Panama and Pioneer Mines, the Porvenir Project, the Luna Roja Deposit, the Caribe Exploration Target, artisanal mining and the Hemco, La Curva, and Vesmisa processing plants.\nSince acquisition, the Company has worked extensively with artisanal miners through the \"Bonanza Model\" that aims to maintain reliability of supply of mineralized material from artisanal miners by exploring to identify areas for them to work, offering a fair price for their production, promoting better work conditions, including health and safety, supporting their organization in cooperatives, and ensuring the participation of miner groups, and local and national authorities in the steering committee that organizes the artisanal miners.\nGold production at the Hemco Property in 2021 totaled 127,151 ounces and 2022 production guidance is 121,000 to 127,000 ounces.\nABOUT MINEROS S.A.\nMineros is a Latin American gold mining company headquartered in Medellin, Colombia. The Company has a diversified asset base, with mines in Colombia, Nicaragua and Argentina and a pipeline of development and exploration projects throughout the region.\nThe board of directors and management of Mineros have extensive experience in mining, corporate development, finance and sustainability.

(\"Zacatecas\" or the \"Company\") (TSXV: ZAC) (OTC Markets: ZCTSF) (Frankfurt: 7TV) is pleased to report multiple silver and base metal assays from the ongoing maiden diamond drilling at El Cristo vein system. Despite only testing the near surface, often strongly oxidized parts of the El Cristo veins, assay results indicate significant silver mineralization over downhole intervals of up to 9.53 m.\nEl Cristo is the NW strike extension of the prolific and well known Veta Grande vein system onto the Zacatecas Silver property.\nHighlights:\nA maiden diamond drill program is targeting intermediate sulphidation veins at the El Cristo project. El Cristo is the NW strike extension of the well-known Veta Grande system.\nInitial El Cristo results include:\nTo date the Company has completed 28 holes for 2811 metres with assay results pending for 15 holes.\nDr. Chris Wilson, Chief Operating Officer and a Director of Zacatecas comments, \"The Company has now received assay results for 13 of 28 diamond drill holes at El Cristo. All holes targeted the shallow depth extension of intermediate sulphidation veins below near-surface historical workings or areas proximal to shallow historical shafts. Several holes hit historical mining voids or zones of backfill material over widths of up to 5 m, suggesting that a higher-grade part of the near surface vein had already been mined. That there are at least 20 shallow historical shafts at El Cristo, strongly suggests that the system is mineralized. Almost all holes drilled beneath these zones intersected multi-phase sulphidic quartz-carbonate veins with zinc and lead base metal sulphides. Drilling by Zacatecas has only tested small areas of the overall vein system to very shallow depths. That the first thirteen holes intersected a robust silver-equivalent grades over down-hole intercept of up to 9.56 meters is very encouraging. The system is open in all directions across multiple veins.\"\nMineralization at El Cristo is of an intermediate sulphidation epithermal type, which crop out within a dilutional zone that is at least 4 km along strike and up to 600 m wide. Within this zone are multiple, steeply dipping, northwest-southeast trending veins, which have been mined historically from at least 20 near surface shafts and multiple areas of near surface workings.\nEl Cristo represents the northwest strike extension of the Veta Grande vein, which has reported, but unverified, historical production of 200 Moz AgEq. The veins at El Cristo show similar characteristics to those at Veta Grande, have a similar orientation, and are part of the same sigmoidal zone of dilation.\nHistorically the El Cristo vein system was only tested by 8 angled diamond drill holes which targeted veins at depths of below 100 to 200 metres. Of these six were concentrated within a 500 m strike length in the central parts of the veins.\nZacatecas drill holes targeted the near surface depth extension of the larger surface workings and/or the depth extension of veins around the deeper historical shaft. The 28 holes drilled to date by the Company have been scout holes also designed to test select veins over at least 2 km of strike extension.\nHole CRI-2022-001 intercepted 5 metres of back-fill material and 4.5 m of footwall mineralization for a combined intercept of 9.53 meters @ 175 Ag Eq (167 g/t Ag, 0.12 % Zn and 0.04 % Pb) from 40.03 m downhole. It seems likely that the back-fill was lower grade material used to fill the void left from mining a higher grade vein.\nHole CRI-2022-002 was a step-down of hole 001, which targeted the vein approximately 40 m vertical deeper, and intercepted 1.45 meters @ 121 Ag Eq (11.3 g/t Ag, 1.6 % Zn and 0.5% Pb and 0.18 g/t Au) from 109.05 m downhole.\nHoles CRI-2022-003 to 007 were drilled off the same drill pad in the same line of section to intercept the vein progressively deeper. Hole CRI-2022-003 intercepted an approximately 5 m wide historical mining void where the target vein had been removed. Results from holes CRI-2022-006 and 007 are pending.\nHole CRI-2022-004 intercepted 0.4 m @ 163 g/t AgEq (12.4 g/t Ag, 2.4% Zn, 0.5% Pb and 0.18 ppm Au) from 57.81 m downhole.\nHole CRI-2022-005 targeted the vein below Hole 004 and intercepted 0.65 meters @ 829 g/t Ag Eq (565 g/t Ag, 1.2 g/t Au, 2.7 % Zn and 1.3 % Pb) from 55.15 m downhole.\nHole CRI-2002-013 encountered significant base metals resulting in 0.5 meters @ 974 g/t Ag Eq (19.6 g/t Ag, 0.23 g/t Au, 17.5% Zn, 1% Pb) from 70.3 m downhole. Also base metal rich, hole CRI-2022-12 resulted in 4.36 meters @ 242 g/t Ag Eq (48 g/t Ag, 0.19 g/t Au, 2.7% Zn and 1.5% Pb) from 54.34 m downhole.\nThe initial results of the maiden El Cristo drill program were successful. While the Company continues to receive assays over the coming weeks, the Company has elected to halt drilling until the results of received. The remaining drill results will provide a greater understanding of the El Cristo vein system and allow Zacatecas to optimize drill target selection in the upcoming months.\nTable 1.

The assays are not capped. Assumptions used in USD for the silver equivalent calculation were metal prices of $24/oz silver, $1,800/oz gold, $1.81/lb zinc, $ 0.90/lb lead and 100% recovery.\nQuality Assurance / Quality Control\nZacatecas follows industry-recognized standards of Best Practice and Quality Assurance/Quality Control. Samples are submitted to ALS in batches of 20 \u2014 comprising 16 half cut core samples, one field blank, two certified reference material standards and one staged duplicate. Samples are sealed in plastic bags using single use tie-locks and delivered to ALS Zacatecas \u2014 thereby ensuring chain of custody. Since the ALS facility in Zacatecas is only a preparation facility, sample pulps were sent to ALS Ireland for fire assay. To date all batches have passed QAQC and blanks and CRM's were within acceptable tolerance limits. All diamond holes were drilled HQ diameter. Core recovery across all veins was better than 98%.\nQualified Person\nThe contents of this news release have been reviewed and approved by Chris Wilson, B.Sc. (Hons), PhD, FAusIMM (CP), FSEG, Chief Operating Officer of Zacatecas. Dr. Wilson is a Qualified Person as defined by NI 43-101 and is responsible for all technical information in this news release.\nAbout Zacatecas Silver Corp.\nThe Zacatecas silver property is located in Zacatecas state, Mexico, within the highly prospective Fresnillo silver belt, which has produced over 6.2 billion ounces of silver. The company holds 7,826 hectares (19,338 acres) of ground that is highly prospective for low-sulphidation and intermediate-sulphidation silver base metal mineralization and potentially low-sulphidation gold-dominant mineralization. On December 15, 2021, Zacatecas announced a mineral resource estimate at the Panuco deposit consisting of 2.7 million tonnes at 187 grams per tonne (g/t) silver equivalent (AgEq) (171 g/t silver (Ag) and 0.17 g/t gold (Au)) for 16.4 million ounces AgEq (15 million ounces silver and 15,000 ounces gold) (See news release dated December 14, 2021).\nThe property is 25 kilometres (km) southeast of MAG Silver Corp.'s Juanicipio mine and Fresnillo PLC's Fresnillo mine. The property shares common boundaries with Pan American Silver Corp. claims and El Orito, which is owned by Endeavour Silver.\nAdditionally, Zacatecas has recently announced a transaction to acquire the Esperanza Gold Project from Alamos Gold Inc. Esperanza is an advanced stage, attractive low-cost, low-capital-intensity and low-technical-risk growth project located in Morelos state, Mexico. Alamos has progressed the project through advanced engineering, including metallurgical work, while also focusing on stakeholder engagement, including building community relations.\nTo date, significant core and reverse circulation drilling has occurred at the Esperanza gold project, resulting in a total of 389 drill holes for 69,716 metres. Four targets adjacent to or close to the historical resource were identified to potentially expand the historical resource. The project also hosts seven regional exploration targets, largely untested, that also merit drill testing.\nAlamos reported in its most recent annual information form a resource estimate of a measured and indicated resource of 34,352,000 tonnes at 0.98 g/t gold and 8.09 g/t silver for 1,083,366 ounces of gold and 8,936,201 ounces of silver and inferred resource of 718,000 tonnes at 0.80 g/t gold and 15.04 g/t silver for 18,375 ounces of gold and 347,192 ounces of silver. The Company considers this to be an historical resource for the purposes of National Instrument 43-101. Resource blocks were defined using with dimensions of 10 metres (m) by 10 m by five m. The estimation of grades was performed with the ordinary kriging method on capped composites. An added step in the estimation strategy was the utilization of the dynamic anisotropy technique in Vulcan's unfolding options. This added capability allows for a more realistic outcome of the estimated grade's spatial distribution as it follows the folded shape of the deposit. Assumptions used in the resource include the following metal prices: gold price of $1,400 (U.S.) per ounce (oz) and silver price of $22 (U.S.) per oz. The resource assumed the following economic assumptions: recovery of 60.4 per cent at 0.2 g/t to 71.9 per cent at 1.6 g/t for gold, 25 per cent for silver, $2.60-per-tonne mining costs, 64-cents-per-tonne general and administrative costs, $4.20-per-tonne milling costs and a pit slope of 45 degrees. The Company considers the resource relevant due to its identification and modelling of the Esperanza deposit.\nThe Company has not done sufficient work to classify the resource as a current mineral resource or mineral reserves and the Company is not treating the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. Although the resource estimate is considered reliable, the Company will resample a portion of the drill core for the purpose of carrying out a new resource estimate. Furthermore, additional data verification, including resurveying of select diamond drill holes collars; review of graphic drill core logs, comparison of these logs with remaining half-cut core and a cross check of select geological logs agonist database entries; and a check of original assay certificates against the assays and drill hole database.\nOn behalf of the Company\nBryan Slusarchuk\nChief Executive Officer and Director\nForward-Looking Statements\nInformation set forth in this news release contains forward-looking statements that are based on assumptions as of the date of this news release.

The Company expects to release its full Q2 financial and operational results after the market closes on August 11, 2022.\nMetallurgy Update\nAs previously announced on February 25, 2022, the Company reported that the AGM experienced lower than expected recoveries in Q1 2022 (see news release \"Galiano Gold Reports Lower than Expected Gold Recovery at the Asanko Gold Mine\"). Subsequent to the announcement, an extensive drilling campaign was completed to provide representative samples for metallurgical testing. The objective of the program was aimed at further defining metallurgical recoveries at Esaase, and to add to the extensive metallurgical test work previously carried out on the Esaase deposit.\nDuring Q2, sixteen diamond drill holes were completed, along strike through both the Esaase Main and South pits. The resulting 2,221 meter increments were tested individually at the AGM laboratory as a preliminary recovery assessment.\nEncouraging results have been received from the initial site assessment which determined the cyanide soluble gold content of pulverized intervals via Bulk Leach Extractable Gold (\"BLEG\") technique followed by fire assay of solid residue. Results to date indicate alignment with the historical metallurgical testwork previously carried out on the Esaase deposit.\nThe metallurgical testing performed at the AGM was conducted on half core material, while the corresponding retained halves have been dispatched to Bureau Veritas in Vancouver for independent 3rd party testing. Results of the independent laboratory testing are expected late in Q3 2022.\nQ2 Operational Update\nDuring Q2, significant work took place to optimize the AGM's plant performance this included revising the mill feed blend regime, increasing the mass pull in the gravity circuit and adjusting operating parameters and reagent additions in the carbon-in-leach circuit. The optimizations resulted in recoveries increasing quarter on quarter, averaging 84% in Q2. Consequently, gold production was positively impacted with preliminary production of approximately 50,000 ounces during the quarter.\n\"Although work continues to further define metallurgical recoveries at Esaase, we are pleased with the initial laboratory recovery results\", said Matt Badylak President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We are additionally encouraged by the strong performance in the plant during the quarter which resulted in preliminary production of 92,300 ounces for the first half of 2022. On the back of improving recoveries and robust production in H1, we expect to provide an update to full year guidance in our upcoming Q2 disclosures.\"\nAbout Galiano Gold Inc.\nGaliano's vision is to build a sustainable business capable of long-term value creation for its stakeholders through a combination of exploration, accretive M&A activities and the disciplined deployment of its financial resources. The Company currently operates and manages the Asanko Gold Mine, located in Ghana, West Africa which is jointly owned with Gold Fields Ltd.

The Company disclosed first quarter fiscal 2022 results in the press release dated January 18, 2022.\nDuring Q2 FY2022, 426 meters were completed in one drill hole and during Q3 FY2022, 1,337 meters were completed in three drill holes, one of them still ongoing. These drill holes were planned to intersect mineralization throughout N40\u00baE direction. Drill hole 22ORW07 intercepted 6.05 m with 22.16 g/t Au and 1.60 m with 27.43 g/t Au. These results confirm the continuity of the mineralization along 250 m Northeast-Southwest trend (see Figure 2). Calcic skarn with sulfides (arsenopyrite mainly) and mineralized silicified breccias were intersected.\n10 drill holes were completed to date (last one in progress) with 2,890 meters. The first four drill holes were focused on defining the skarn mineralization at depth in a previously drilled area and the remaining six drill holes were completed in an undrilled area targeting intersect mineralization related to N40\u00baE structures.\nThe drilling campaign is still in progress focused on defining mineralization to the Northeast and the structure at depth.\nTable 1: Intercepts | ||||\nDDH | From (m) | To (m) | Thick* (m) | Au(gpt) |\n21ORW06 | 88.60 | 89.40 | 0.80 | 13.20 |\n21ORW06 | 233.10 | 236.60 | 3.50 | 1.03 |\n22ORW07 | 218.10 | 218.70 | 0.60 | 3.79 |\n22ORW07 | 271.45 | 277.50 | 6.05 | 22.16 |\n22ORW07 | 342.65 | 344.25 | 1.60 | 27.43 |\n22ORW08 | 142.50 | 143.50 | 1.00 | 0.74 |\n22ORW08 | 206.20 | 207.30 | 1.10 | 0.69 |\n22ORW08 | 260.00 | 261.00 | 1.00 | 0.67 |\n22ORW09 | 299.00 | 301.40 | 2.40 | 0.90 |\n22ORW09 | 329.80 | 331.70 | 1.90 | 4.10 |\n* | Not true widths |\nEl Valle Boin\u00e1s\nThe drilling program continued with its focus on upgrading inferred resources, with a total of 3,197 m of infill drilling completed in Breccia East, Boinas South and High Angle East. Also, 3,392 m of brownfield drilling were executed in High Angle East and E2 to extend the mineralization areas and add inferred resources.\nQuality Control\nGreenfield drill hole samples were sent to an external laboratory (ALS Laboratory) for analyses. Infill and brownfield drill holes samples were analyzed in Orovalle's Laboratory.\nSample preparation was carried out at the El Valle facility. All diamond core samples have been prepared using the following procedure, once split:\nThe core samples are dried at a temperature of 105\u00baC and then crushed through a jaw crusher to 95%<6 mm. The coarse-crushed sample is further reduced to 95%<425 microns using an LM5 bowl-and-puck pulverizer. An Essa rotary splitter is used to take a 450 g to 550 g sub-sample of each split for pulverizing. The remaining reject portion is bagged and stored. The sample is reduced to a nominal -200 mesh using an LM2 bowl-and-puck pulverizer. 140 g sub-samples are split using a special vertical-sided scoop to cut channels through the sample which has been spread into a pancake on a sampling mat. Samples are then sent to the laboratory for gold and base metal analysis. Leftover pulp is bagged and stored.\nAfter sample preparation, 30g samples are analyzed (in Orovalle Laboratory) for Au by fire assay with an atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) finish and two-gram samples for Ag, As, Bi, Cu, Hg, Pb, Sb, Se, and Zn by ICP-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) after an aqua regia digestion.\nIn case of the samples sent to an external laboratory, 30 g samples are analyzed for Au by fire assay with an atomic absorption (Au AA-25) and 35 elements by ICP (ME-ICP41) after an aqua regia digestion. When Au and Ag values are >100 ppm and Cu and As values are >10,000 ppm, specific analysis methods are used to determinate the final grade.\nThe reported work has been completed using industry standard procedures, including a quality assurance/quality control (\"QA/QC\") program consisting of the insertion of certified reference material, blanks and duplicates samples into the sample stream.\nThe exploration update was prepared under the supervision of Guadalupe Collar Men\u00e9ndez, a qualified person for the purposes of NI 43-101 and an employee of Orovalle Minerals S.L., a subsidiary of Orvana.\nFinancial Performance\nQ3 FY2022 financials will be released mid-August, 2022.\nCautionary Statements - Forward-Looking Information\nCertain statements in this presentation constitute forward-looking statements or forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws (\"forward-looking statements\").

Based on yesterday\u2019s closing share price on NYSE American of $10.40 per share, the value of the new shares that will be issued as consideration is currently $53,279,658. Completion of the Transaction will be subject to several conditions set out below.\nHighlights\n-\nBilboes is a large, high grade gold deposit located approximately 75 km north of Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. Historically, it has been subject to a limited amount of open pit mining.\n-\nThe Project has NI43-101 compliant proven and probable mineral reserves of 1.96 million ounces of gold at a grade of 2.29 g/t and measured and indicated mineral resources of 2.56 million ounces of gold at a grade of 2.26 g/t and inferred mineral resources of 577,000 ounces of gold at a grade of 1.89 g/t. The Project has produced approximately 288,000 ounces of gold since 1989.\n-\nA feasibility study prepared by the vendors (the \u201cDRA Feasibility Study\u201d) indicates the potential for an open-pit gold mine producing an average of 168,000 ounces per year over a 10-year life of mine.\n-\nCaledonia will conduct its own feasibility study to identify the most judicious way to commercialise the Project to optimize shareholder returns. One approach that will be considered is a phased development which would minimise the initial capital investment and reduce the need for third party funding.\n-\nPrior to completion of the Transaction, Caledonia will enter a tribute arrangement with Bilboes Holdings so that oxide operations can be re-started with the expectation that Bilboes Holdings will return to profitable operations within 6 months. This also has the benefit of an element of pre-stripping for the main development of the Project.\n-\nThe Transaction is subject to several conditions including:\n-\nthat Bilboes Holdings receives confirmation from the Zimbabwe authorities that it will, for the life of the mine, be able to export gold directly and to retain 100 per cent of the sale proceeds in US dollars with no requirement to convert US dollar gold revenues into domestic currency; and\n-\nan arrangement with or confirmation from the Zimbabwe authorities and/or an independent power producer regarding the future availability of a sufficiently reliable and affordable electricity supply to the Project.\n-\n-\nCaledonia will, subject to satisfaction of conditions and any customary adjustments to the purchase price to account for any extraordinary liabilities incurred before completion, purchase Bilboes Gold Limited (\u201cBilboes Gold\u201d) for a consideration to be settled by the issue to the sellers of 5,123,044 new shares in Caledonia and a 1 per cent NSR on the Project\u2019s revenues. Based on yesterday\u2019s closing share price on NYSE American of $10.40 per share, the value of the new shares that will be issued as consideration is currently $53,279,658.\nCommenting on the announcement, Mark Learmonth, Chief Executive Officer, said:\n\u201cWe are delighted to have signed an agreement for the purchase of Bilboes, the premier gold development project in Zimbabwe, and indeed one of the best gold development projects in Africa.\n\u201cThis is a transformational asset for Caledonia, as we embark on the next step in our journey to become a multi-asset, mid-tier gold producer. Once in full production (which will be subject to financing of the capex) Caledonia\u2019s management believes that Bilboes could produce three times our current 64 per cent attributable share of gold production from Blanket, resulting in production from the enlarged Caledonia group being potentially four times its current size.\n\u201cThe acquisition of Bilboes will build on the recent acquisition of the Maligreen claims which host NI 43-101 compliant inferred mineral resources of 940,000 ounces of gold in 15.6 million tonnes at a grade of 1.88g/t1. We continue our work at Maligreen which is focused on increasing the confidence level of the resource base.\n\u201cWe have followed the progress of Bilboes for several years and today\u2019s announcement marks the culmination of many years of hard work on the part of both the Caledonia and Bilboes management teams.\n\u201cThe proposed acquisition of Bilboes is well timed following the completion of the Central Shaft project at Blanket in 2021 as we look to reinvest some of our surplus cash flow in this exciting new growth opportunity.\n\u201cI look forward to updating shareholders as we review the investment plan for Bilboes and as we continue work at Maligreen.\u201d\nAbout Bilboes\nBilboes was formerly owned and explored by Anglo American Corporation Zimbabwe Limited prior to its exit from the Zimbabwean gold sector in 2003. The project is approximately 75km north of Bulawayo with a total land package comprising mining claims covering 6,870 hectares and exclusive prospecting orders totaling approximately 92,000 hectares. Bilboes Gold is owned by the following:\n-\nToziyana Resources Limited (\u201cToziyana\u201d) (50 per cent) \u2013 a private Mauritius company wholly owned by GAT Investments (Private) Limited, a Zimbabwe company which is controlled by Mr. Victor Gapare, a prominent Zimbabwean mining entrepreneur. Mr Gapare was previously the Operations Director for the gold and pyrites business of Anglo American Corporation Zimbabwe Limited when Bilboes was part of its portfolio, prior to a management buyout in which he was involved, and is a former President of the Chamber of Mines Zimbabwe. Following the successful completion of the Transaction, Mr Gapare will be appointed as an executive director of Caledonia;\n-\nBaker Steel Resources Trust Limited (\u201cBSRT\u201d) (24 per cent) \u2013 a London-listed investment trust managed by Baker Steel Capital; and\n-\nInfinite Treasure Limited (\u201cInfinite Treasure\u201d) (26 per cent) \u2013 a British Virgin Islands registered subsidiary of Shining Capital Holdings LP. II, a Cayman Islands registered investment fund.\nThe Project has produced a total of approximately 288,000 ounces of gold since 1989 of which approximately 90,000 ounces were produced by the current owners. Bilboes has also completed a total of 93,400 meters of drilling over a total strike length of 7.4km. Approximately 60 per cent of this drilling was diamond core drilling.\nBilboes Gold had an unaudited loss before tax for the year ended 31 December 2021 of $1.5m and unaudited net assets at 31 May 2022 of $23m. The audit process is progressing and audited results for the year ended 31 December 2021 are expected to be completed prior to the Transaction completing. Investors should note that the historic financial performance of the business relates primarily to the legacy oxide mining operations and not the larger scale sulphide project.\nBilboes Holdings engaged DRA Projects (Pty) Ltd (\u201cDRA\u201d) to complete the DRA Feasibility Study with an effective date of 15 December 2021 for the Project, a copy of which is being filed on SEDAR today2. The mineral resources and reserves set out in the report are summarised below:\n| Mineral Resources (Cut off grade 0.9g/t) | |||\n| Category | Tonnes (Mt) | Grade (g/t) | Ounces (koz) |\n| Measured | 6.128 | 2.51 | 495 |\n| Indicated | 29.052 | 2.21 | 2,061 |\n| Total M&I | 35.180 | 2.26 | 2,555 |\n| Inferred | 9.475 | 1.89 | 577 |\n| In Situ Mineral Reserves | |||\n| Category | Tonnes (Mt) | Grade (g/t) | Ounces (koz) |\n| Proven | 5.858 | 2.42 | 456 |\n| Probable | 20.785 | 2.26 | 1,509 |\n| Total Proven & Probable | 26.644 | 2.29 | 1,964 |\n-\nMineral resources are inclusive of mineral reserves.\n-\nMineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.\n-\nMineral resources have been assessed using a long term gold price of $2,400/oz and mineral reserves have been assessed using a long term gold price of $1,500/oz\n-\nCIM definitions (May 10, 2014) observed for classification of mineral resources.\n-\nBlock bulk density interpolated from specific gravity measurements taken from core samples.\n-\nResources are constrained by a Lerchs-Grossman (LG) optimized pit shell using Whittle software.\n-\nMineral resources are not mineral reserves and have no demonstrated economic viability. The estimate of mineral resources may be materially affected by mining, processing, metallurgical, infrastructure, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors (\u201cModifying Factors\u201d).\n-\nNumbers may not add due to rounding.\n-\nEffective date of resource estimate is 25th of October 2021.\n-\nDRA is confident that enough geological work has been undertaken, and sufficient geological understanding gained, to enable the construction of an ore body model suitable for the derivation of mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates. DRA considers that both the modelling and the grade interpolation have been carried out in an unbiased manner and that the resulting grade and tonnage estimates should be reliable within the context of the classification applied. In addition, DRA is not aware of any metallurgical, infrastructural, environmental, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, or marketing issues that would impact on the mineral resource, or reserve statements as presented in the DRA Feasibility Study.\nFeasibility studies\nCaledonia will conduct its own feasibility study to identify the most judicious way to commercialise the Project to optimise shareholder returns, having regard to the availability of debt and equity on acceptable terms to augment the cash that is expected to be generated from Caledonia\u2019s existing gold operation in Zimbabwe, the Blanket Mine. One approach that will be considered is a phased development which would minimise the initial capital investment and reduce the need for third party funding.\nFor information purposes only, the DRA Feasibility Study indicates the potential for an open-pit gold mine producing an average of 168,000 ounces per year over a 10-year life of mine.\nSpecifically, the DRA Feasibility Study has the following highlights:\n| Life of Mine | 10 Years | |||||\n| Planned Production Rates | Isabella & McCays 2.88Mtpa | |||||\n| Life of Mine Gold Production (Oz) | 1.673 million ounces | |||||\n| Average Annual Nine Year Steady state LOM Production (koz) | 168koz per year | |||||\n| Peak Production (koz) | 208koz per year | |||||\n| LOM C1 Cash Cost ($/oz) | $719/oz | |||||\n| Peak Funding Requirement ($m) | $250m | |||||\n| Economic Analysis as at 15thDecember 2021 |\n| |||||\n| Gold Price ($/oz) | $1,350/oz | $1,500/oz | $1,650/oz | |||\n| Post Tax NPV (10%) ($m) | $126.9m | $225.2m | $323.3m | |||\n| Post Tax IRR (%) | 20.5% | 27.3% | 33.4% | |||\n| AISC ($/oz) | $811/oz | $818/oz | $826/oz |\nThe ore at the Bilboes deposits is refractory and will require specialised metallurgical processing. DRA has conducted work on the metallurgical processing which concludes that approximately 84 per cent of the gold contained can be recovered using Biox technology in conjunction with gravity and carbon-in-leach processing. DRA\u2019s work has been reviewed by Caledonia\u2019s internal team and technical consultants during the due diligence process.\nAs indicated above, Caledonia believes the development plan outlined in the DRA Feasibility Study can be modified to a phased approach with lower initial production and a lower peak funding requirement. Based on Caledonia\u2019s assessment of the existing capital intensity of the Project and Caledonia\u2019s experience of project development in Zimbabwe, Caledonia estimates that the peak up-front capital investment could be reduced to less than $100m for the construction of a mine with an initial production capacity of approximately 60,000 ounces per year before increasing the operation in subsequent phases to achieve an operation of similar scale to that described in the DRA Feasibility Study, being approximately 168,000 ounces per year. Caledonia intends to spend approximately 12 months following completion of the Transaction further reviewing the DRA Feasibility Study with a view to formulating a project development plan that takes into account Caledonia\u2019s future cash generation profile from the Blanket Mine and the oxide mining and processing operations at Bilboes (described further below), the availability of additional funding on acceptable terms and Caledonia\u2019s experience of developing large-scale mining projects in Zimbabwe over the past 6 years (e.g. the Central Shaft project). Accordingly, readers should treat the foregoing economic highlights as indicative only and as subject to change following the finalisation of Caledonia\u2019s revised development plan. Caledonia will update the market when the results of its own feasibility study review are complete.\nThe Transaction\nSubject to the satisfaction of various conditions precedent, Caledonia will purchase Bilboes Gold for a total consideration comprising 5,123,044 Caledonia shares and a 1 per cent NSR from the Project at completion (the \u201cConsideration\u201d). Subject to receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals, the Consideration will be split amongst the current Bilboes Gold shareholders as follows:\n-\n2,863,336 new shares in Caledonia will be issued to Toziyana of which approximately 441,000 Caledonia shares will be withheld by Caledonia and will be issued to Infinite Treasure in settlement of a separate commercial arrangement between Toziyana\u2019s holding company and Infinite Treasure. The issue of the withheld shares to Infinite Treasure is subject to Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe approval for the commercial arrangement between Toziyana\u2019s holding company and Infinite Treasure:\n-\n800,000 new shares in Caledonia and the 1% NSR will be issued to BSRT; and\n-\n1,459,708 new shares in Caledonia will be issued to Infinite Treasure. As noted above, Infinite Treasure will also receive a further approximately 441,000 Caledonia shares from Toziyana\u2019s allocation of Consideration shares in settlement of their separate commercial arrangement.\nThe Consideration shares shall be subject to sale restrictions for a 6-month period following completion of the Transaction. The NSR is perpetual but will be capped at a figure to be agreed between the parties but is currently indicated to be a theoretical maximum of $75million (which would require the Project to produce revenues of $7.5billion).\nToziyana, as the largest new holder of shares and Caledonia will enter into a relationship agreement with customary terms upon the new Consideration shares being issued.\nCaledonia currently has 12,833,126 shares in issue. The issue of an additional 5,123,044 new shares (on the basis that all shares are issued and there is no adjustment to the consideration) would result in the total number of shares in issue increasing to 17,956,170, giving the current owners of Bilboes Gold Limited an aggregate of 28.5 per cent of the post Transaction shares in issue.\nThe Transaction will be subject to several conditions precedent including but not limited to:\n-\nAn arrangement with the Zimbabwe authorities which allows inter alia:\n-\nthat Bilboes Holdings will, for the life of the mine, be able to export gold directly and to retain 100 per cent of the sale proceeds in US dollars; and\n-\nthat there will be no requirement for Bilboes Holdings to convert US dollar gold revenues into domestic currency;\n-\n-\nan arrangement with the Zimbabwe authorities, or an independent power producer regarding the future availability and cost of a sufficiently reliable electricity supply to the Bilboes mining and processing operations;\n-\nZimbabwean regulatory approvals from the Zimbabwe Competition and Tariff Commission, the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority and the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe; and\n-\napprovals for the listing of the Consideration shares from applicable securities exchanges.\nUnder the terms of the Transaction, Caledonia will take on the working capital obligations of the Bilboes group at the time of completion. The Bilboes group is estimated to have a current net working capital liability of approximately $6 million.\nOn completion of the acquisition, Mr Gapare is expected to be appointed as an executive director with specific responsibility for government relations in Zimbabwe, the implementation of Caledonia\u2019s environmental and sustainability strategy and participation in investor relations, with a salary of US$470,000 and short and long-term incentives that are offered to other senior executives. His extensive experience of both the Project and mining in Zimbabwe will be an invaluable addition to the Board.\nTribute arrangement to generate short-term cashflow\nBilboes currently has a functional oxide mining and metallurgical plant at the Project site which has historically produced up to 20,000 ounces of gold per annum but is currently on care and maintenance. Caledonia will enter into a tribute agreement with Bilboes Holdings to mine the oxide and transitional ore. This tribute agreement will commence as soon as it has been registered with the relevant authorities and will continue until completion of the Transaction. The objective of the tribute arrangement is to create short term cash flow and allow Bilboes Holdings to maintain its operational integrity in the period up to completion of the Transaction and the commencement of sulphide mining operations. Under the terms of the tribute agreement, Caledonia will fund the necessary capital and operational costs and will receive 100 per cent of the revenue from the mining operation while paying a 5 per cent royalty to Bilboes Holdings which it will apply to its working capital liabilities. The cumulative maximum funding cost to restart the oxides is expected to be in the range of $3 million to $5 million and the oxide mining operation is expected to take approximately 6 months to restart and repay the initial funding costs. On completion of the Transaction or if the Transaction fails to complete and Caledonia has recouped its investment at an adequate internal rate of return, the tribute agreement will be terminated. On completion of the Transaction, Caledonia expects to continue to mine and process the oxides and transitional ore and to use the proceeds to contribute towards funding the capital cost of the larger scale sulphide project.\nRothschild & Co acted as financial advisor to Caledonia. Hannam & Partners acted as financial advisor to Bilboes.\nCaledonia\u2019s Chairman, Leigh Wilson, also commented on the announcement, saying:\n\u201cIt gives me great satisfaction to sign an agreement for the purchase of Bilboes, a transformational asset for our business. Today\u2019s announcement represents the culmination of many months of hard work on behalf of both parties for which I extend my and the board\u2019s sincere appreciation.\n\u201cI would like to extend a welcome to Bilboes\u2019 existing shareholders as they become significant shareholders in Caledonia on completion and I look forward to their long-term support as we continue to grow the business. I would also like to extend a warm welcome to all the employees of Bilboes as we look forward to them becoming our colleagues.\n\u201cAs with many deals of this nature there remain several significant conditions precedent which I am confident that both parties will continue to work to resolve. Pending the successful resolution of these matters and the subsequent completion of the Transaction, I look forward to working with Victor as a fellow director.\n\u201cLastly, I would like to take this opportunity to thank our existing shareholders, many of whom have been investors in Caledonia for over a decade. Their patience has been rewarded as we have delivered on our strategy over the last decade, and I look forward to their continued support as we embark on the next phase of growth.\u201d\nConference Call Details\nManagement will host a conference call / webinar at 2pm British Summer Time on July 28, 2022.\nDetails for the call are as follows:\nWhen: July 28, 2022 at 02:00 PM London\nTopic: Webinar for Caledonia Shareholders\nRegister in advance for this webinar:\nhttps://caledoniamining.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_iuYwxS76Q8yNMNhPC94Dgw\nAfter registering, you will receive a confirmation email containing information about joining the webinar.\n| Caledonia Mining Corporation Plc |\n|\n| Mark Learmonth | Tel: +44 1534 679 802 |\n| Cenkos Securities plc (Nomad and Joint Broker) |\n|\n| Adrian Hadden | Tel: +44 207 397 1965 |\n| Liberum Capital Limited (Joint Broker) |\n|\n| Scott Mathieson/Kane Collings | Tel: +44 20 3100 2000 |\n| BlytheRay Financial PR |\n|\n| Tim Blythe/Megan Ray | Tel: +44 207 138 3204 |\n| 3PPB |\n|\n| Patrick Chidley | Tel: +1 917 991 7701 |\n| Curate Public Relations (Zimbabwe) |\n|\n| Debra Tatenda | Tel: +263 77802131 |\n| Rothschild & Co (Financial Advisor to Caledonia) |\n|\n| Giles Douglas | Tel: +27 11 428 3700 |\nNote: The information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information under the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 (\u201cMAR\u201d) as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and is disclosed in accordance with the Company's obligations under Article 17 of MAR.\nCautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Information\nInformation and statements contained in this news release that are not historical facts are \u201cforward-looking information\u201d within the meaning of applicable securities legislation that involve risks and uncertainties relating, but not limited, to Caledonia\u2019s current expectations, intentions, plans, and beliefs.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements or information. Forward-looking statements or information in this news release relate to, among other things: the timing for, amount of, and anticipated results of, any exploration or development programs with respect to the Company's La Colorada Skarn project, including the potential for further definition or expansion of the mineral resource in the future; the timing of any update to the mineral resource estimate and the results of any such update; and the potential generation of minerals, if any, and the quality thereof.\nThese forward-looking statements and information reflect the Company's current views with respect to future events and are necessarily based upon a number of assumptions that, while considered reasonable by the Company, are inherently subject to significant operational, business, economic and regulatory uncertainties and contingencies. These assumptions include: our mineral resource estimates and the assumptions upon which they are based; ore grades and recoveries; prices for silver, gold, and base metals remaining as estimated; currency exchange rates remaining as estimated; capital, decommissioning and reclamation estimates; prices for energy inputs, labour, materials, supplies and services (including transportation); all necessary permits, licenses and regulatory approvals for the La Colorada mine and related exploration projects are received in a timely manner; our ability to secure and maintain the surface rights necessary for our operations; and our ability to comply with environmental, health and safety laws. The foregoing list of assumptions is not exhaustive.\nThe Company cautions the reader that forward-looking statements and information involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements or information contained in this news release and the Company has made assumptions and estimates based on or related to many of these factors. Such factors include, without limitation: the duration and effects of the COVID-19 virus and any other pandemics on our operations and workforce, and the effects on global economies and society; fluctuations in silver and gold prices; fluctuations in prices for energy inputs, labour, materials, supplies and services (including transportation); fluctuations in currency markets (such as the Canadian dollar, Peruvian sol, Mexican peso, Argentine peso and Bolivian boliviano versus the U.S. dollar); risks relating to inflation and the global economic environment; operational risks and hazards inherent with the business of mining (including environmental accidents and hazards, industrial accidents, equipment breakdown, unusual or unexpected geological or structural formations, cave-ins, flooding and severe weather); risks relating to the credit worthiness or financial condition of suppliers, refiners and other parties with whom the Company does business; inadequate insurance, or inability to obtain insurance, to cover these risks and hazards; employee relations; relationships with, and claims by, local communities and indigenous populations; our ability to obtain all necessary permits, licenses and regulatory approvals in a timely manner; changes in laws, regulations and government practices, including environmental, export and import laws and regulations; changes in national and local government, legislation, taxation, controls or regulations and political, legal or economic developments in Canada, the United States, Mexico, Peru, Argentina, Bolivia, Guatemala or other countries where the Company may carry on business, including legal restrictions relating to mining; risks relating to expropriation; risk of liability relating to our past sale of the Quiruvilca mine in Peru; diminishing quantities or grades of Mineral Reserves as properties are mined; increased competition in the mining industry for equipment and qualified personnel; and those factors identified under the caption \"Risks Related to Pan American's Business\" in the Company's most recent form 40-F and Annual Information Form filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and Canadian provincial securities regulatory authorities, respectively. Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated, described or intended. Investors are cautioned against undue reliance on forward-looking statements or information. Forward-looking statements and information are designed to help readers understand management's current views of our near and longer term prospects and may not be appropriate for other purposes. The Company does not intend, nor does it assume any obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements or information, whether as a result of new information, changes in assumptions, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by applicable law.\nCautionary Note to US Investors\nThis news release has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Canadian NI 43-101 and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Definition Standards, which differ from the requirements of U.S. securities laws. NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators that establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects.\nCanadian public disclosure standards, including NI 43-101, differ significantly from the requirements of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), and information concerning mineralization, deposits, mineral reserve and resource information contained or referred to herein may not be comparable to similar information disclosed by U.S. companies. In particular, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this news release uses the terms ''measured resources'', ''indicated resources'', and ''inferred resources''. U.S. investors are advised that, while such terms are recognized and required by Canadian securities laws, the SEC does not recognize them. The requirements of NI 43-101 for identification of ''reserves'' are not the same as those of the SEC, and mineral reserves reported by the Company in compliance with NI 43-101 may not qualify as ''reserves'' under SEC standards. Under U.S. standards, mineralization may not be classified as a ''reserve'' unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that any part of a \"measured resource\" or \"indicated resource\" will ever be converted into a \"reserve\". U.S. investors should also understand that \"inferred resources\" have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of \"inferred resources\" exist, are economically or legally mineable or will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian securities laws, estimated \"inferred resources\" may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies except in rare cases. Disclosure of \"contained ounces\" in a mineral resource is permitted disclosure under Canadian securities laws.

(TSX.V: ELVT) (OTCQX: EVGDF) (the \"Company\" or \"Elevation Gold\") is pleased to announce that exploration discovery drilling has commenced on the Florence Hill target located on the Moss Mine Property in Mohave Country Arizona (see Figure 1: Moss Project Drilling Location).\nMichael G. Allen, President of Elevation Gold, stated, \"We are excited to be doing the maiden drill program on the Florence Hill Target. Recent geophysical work by the Company has identified key structures from the historic Oatman district that continue to Florence Hill. In addition, geochemical, and alteration mapping indicate the presence of a large hydrothermal system in this area. It is unusual to find an undrilled target with these features in the lower 48, and the Company is excited about the potential for making a new discovery.\"\nMore than 2 million ounces of gold have been historically produced from underground mining in the Oatman district (e.g., DeWitt et al., 1986; report.pdf (usgs.gov)). Most of the historic production was from the northwest-trending United Western, United Eastern, Tom Reed, Big Jim, and Gold Road epithermal vein systems, which appear to intersect in the Florence Hill area. Average head grades for these historic mines are reported to have ranged between approximately 10 g/t and 33 g/t gold.\nThe Company has planned a program of approximately 3,800 meters of oriented diamond core drilling, focused primarily on the Florence Hill target (see May 31, 2022, News Release). In addition, the Company has built roads and drill pads to test adjacent fault-hosted targets, including the Silver Creek Springs, eastern West Oatman, and possibly the Hardy Vein exploration targets.\nDr. Warwick S. Board, Vice President of Exploration for Elevation Gold, stated, \"The proximity of significant historic producers in the Oatman district and their location on structures that intersect the Silver Creek Caldera margin in the Florence Hill area, highlights the potential of the Florence Hill exploration target. Ongoing geological and geophysical work continues to add to our knowledge of the multiple features that are coincident in the Florence Hill exploration area. Key learnings from successive drillholes will be used to iteratively optimize drill targeting in the Florence Hill and similar target areas along the caldera margin. Everyone at Elevation Gold is excited about what this drilling may discover.\"\nIn addition, the Company is pleased to provide an update the Company's multi-phase infill and resource expansion drilling program at the Moss Mine in northwestern Arizona (see Figure 1: Moss Project Drilling Location). Results discussed include those from infill drilling below the active West Pit, the Eastern Extension, as well as from condemnation drilling in the proposed 3B Leach Pad area (see Figure 2: Drillhole Location Map).\nMichael G. Allen, President of Elevation Gold, added \"Infill drilling results continue to highlight the potential for resource and reserve expansion to the west, east, and at depth below the current mine operations. We are particularly encouraged by the continued intersection of relatively broad zones of stockwork mineralization below and to the west of the West Pit, as well as the apparent increase in thickness with depth in the Moss Vein in the Eastern Extension Area.\"\nRecent Moss Mine Drilling Highlights\nWest Pit\nInfill drilling continues to indicate the presence of broad intersections of stockwork and vein-hosted mineralization beneath the active West Pit (see May 3, 2022, News Release; Figure 2: Drillhole Location Map; Figure 3: Cross-Section: Line 11W, West Pit). Stockwork mineralization was intersected from surface down to almost 160 meters below surface in this tranche of drilling.\nDrillhole AR22-613R intersected 60.96 meters of hanging wall stockwork grading 0.54 g/t gold and 5.13 g/t silver, including 10.67 meters grading 1.00 g/t gold and 6.80 g/t silver, starting from surface, and a further 41.15 meters grading 0.30 g/t gold and 7.70 g/t silver from a depth of ~80 meters below surface.\nDrillhole AR22-606R intersected 138.68 meters of hanging wall stockwork mineralization grading 0.38 g/t gold and 0.93 g/t silver, including 3.05 meters grading 3.35 g/t gold and 1.60 g/t silver, and 4.57 meters grading 0.85 g/t gold and 1.47 g/t silver, starting around seven meters below surface.\nEastern Extension\nDrilling approximately 100 meters to the east of the current East Pit intersected stockwork and vein-hosted epithermal gold-silver mineralization in the Moss Vein from a depth of about 110 meters below surface (see Figure 2: Drillhole Location Map; Figure 4: Cross Section: Line Zero, East Extension). The vein appears to increase in thickness and grade with depth, being blind at surface in this area. Additional drilling is being planned to further explore the Moss Vein to the east of the current East Pit.\nDrillhole AR22-579R intersected 32.00 meters of stockwork and vein-hosted mineralization grading 0.84 g/t gold and 10.91 g/t silver, including 12.19 meters grading 1.56 g/t gold and 20.70 g/t silver, from a depth of ~150 meters below surface.\n3B Leach Pad Condemnation Drilling\nStockwork and vein-hosted epithermal gold and silver mineralization was intersected in nine of the ten condemnation drillholes drilled in the proposed 3B Leach Pad area (see Table 1). Drillhole intersections are mainly of low grade stockwork mineralization ranging from more than a meter to almost 40 meters in downhole thickness. Mineralization that may be related to the north-dipping Mordor Vein was intersected at depths of between approximately 22 meters and 58 meters below surface in drillholes AR22-616R and AR22-617R, approximately 400 meters to the west of the active West Pit (see Figure 1: Moss Project Drilling Location).\nDrillhole AR22-616R intersected 18.29 meters grading 0.50 g/t gold and 2.23 g/t silver from a depth of around 22 meters below surface.\nDrillhole AR22-617R intersected 25.91 meters grading 0.53 g/t gold and 4.16 g/t silver. Including 4.57 meters grading 1.54 g/t gold and 6.90 g/t silver from a depth of about 58 meters below surface.\nA complete list of the latest results from Elevation Gold's infill and near-mine exploration drilling at the Moss Mine is provided in Table 1.\nInfill and Near-mine Drilling Program\nThe drilling presented in this news release is focused on infill and resource expansion drilling targeting the Moss and Ruth Veins and associated hanging wall stockwork beneath and adjacent to the West Pit, as well as condemnation drilling in the proposed 3B Leach Pad area (see Figure 2: Drillhole Location Map).\nAssay results from 31 RC drillholes, including 12 drillholes from the West Pit area, nine drillholes from the East Extension area, and ten condemnation drillholes from the proposed 3B Leach Pad area, are presented in Table 1. Assay results are pending for twenty-six additional holes drilled as part of the infill and near-mine drilling program and will be released upon receipt and compilation.\nTable 1: Latest Results from

and between 55% to 96% for drillholes oriented between -85 degrees to -45 degrees to the south targeting the Ruth Vein and parallel stockwork structures. Although true thickness of the stockwork system between the Moss and Ruth Veins is generally difficult to assess due to the variably oriented multiple veins and veinlets that make up this zone, stockwork mineralization intersections reported for angled drillholes in the table above are considered reflective of the broader bulk tonnage mineralization target zone thickness. Stockwork zone intersections in subvertical holes likely range between 60-85% of reported zone thickness. Assay data are uncapped. AuEq = Au + Ag/75. RC drilling was conducted by Boart Longyear. RC samples, collected every 1.52 m, were transported in sealed bags to Skyline Assayers and Laboratories (Skyline) in Tucson, AZ. Field control QAQC samples, including standards, blanks, and field duplicates, were inserted into the sample stream at a rate of three field control samples every 20 regular samples. Gold was determined by fire-assay fusion of 30 g sub-samples with atomic absorption spectroscopy (method FA-01). Overlimit samples of gold were assayed by gravimetric means (FA-02).

Settlement will be in US funds by delivery of gold at the financial institutions\u2019 designated gold refinery in Switzerland and sold at the then Bloomberg BGN XAUUSD spot market price less 7%. The annual interest rate of this gold forward facility is 7.53%.\nThe Company assumes no derivative risks from the transaction as the loan principal is denominated in US funds and repayments from gold deliveries will be made in US funds, thereby providing a natural currency hedge.\nThrough this facility Asante obtains an immediate and non-dilutive financing, repayable from gold production. The Bibiani Mine has completed its commissioning, with the first gold pour announced on July 7, 2022.\nThe Company thanks the Financing Institutions for their confidence and financial support as Asante continues to develop its production profile in Ghana.\nThe Company is also in advanced discussions on additional senior secured debt facilities to provide for ongoing sustaining capital.\nAbout Asante Gold Corporation\nAsante is a gold exploration, development and operating company with a high-quality portfolio of projects in Ghana. Asante is currently operating the Bibiani Gold Mine with forecast production of 175,000 oz of gold over the next 12 months, is completing the acquisition of the Chirano Gold Mine from Kinross Gold Corporation (the Chirano Acquisition), and is developing to production its Kubi Gold mine, all located on the prolific Bibiani and Ashanti Gold Belts. Asante has an experienced and skilled team of mine finders, builders and operators, with extensive experience in Ghana.\nAsante is listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange, the Ghana Stock Exchange and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Asante is also exploring its Keyhole, Fahiakoba and Betenase projects for new discoveries, all adjoining or along strike of major gold mines near the centre of Ghana\u2019s Golden Triangle. Additional information is available on the Company\u2019s website at www.asantegold.com.\nAbout the Bibiani Gold Mine\nBibiani is a historically significant gold mine situated in the western region of Ghana, with previous gold production close to 5 Moz. It is fully permitted with available mining and processing infrastructure on-site consisting of a 3 million tonne per annum mill and processing plant, and existing mining infrastructure. Mining commenced in late February with the first gold pour announced on July 7, 2022. The Company is targeting 175,000 oz of gold production over the next 12 months.\nThe Current Mineral Resource Estimate for Bibiani, as reported in the Technical Report on the Bibiani Gold Mine, Ghana, by Principal Author Ian M Glacken FAusIMM (CP), FAIG, CEng and Qualified Person Dan Bansah MSc, MAusIMM (CP), FWAIMM, MGIG, dated November 7, 2021, and filed on SEDAR, is Measured and Indicated 20.1 million tonnes at 2.71 grams of gold per tonne for 1.81 Moz of gold, plus Inferred 8.41 million tonnes at 2.78 grams of gold per tonne for 0.75 Moz of gold from an open pit mine. The Mineral Resource has been reported above a 0.65 g/t gold cut-off and has been depleted for both historical open pit and underground development as of August 31, 2017. The Bibiani Main Pit mineral resource has been prepared by Competent Persons (Optiro, 2017) using accepted industry practices and have been classified and reported in accordance with the JORC Code (JORC, 2012). There are no material differences between the definitions of Measured, Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources under the CIM Definition Standards and the equivalent definitions in the JORC Code. The Satellite pit resource is an update completed in 2018 by Resolute Mining Limited. The Satellite pit resource is also reported above a cut-off grade of 0.65 g/t gold inside a pit shell defined at a gold price of US$1,950. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.\nAbout the Chirano Gold Mine\nThe Chirano Gold Mine is an operating open-pit and underground mining operation located in southwestern Ghana, immediately south of the Company's Bibiani Gold Mine. The Chirano Gold Mine was first explored and developed in 1996 and began production in October 2005. The Chirano Gold Mine comprises the Akwaaba, Suraw, Akoti South, Akoti North, Akoti Extended, Paboase, Tano, Obra South, Obra, Sariehu and Mamnao open pits and the Akwaaba and Paboase underground mines.\nCautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements.

For further information, please see the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements and Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&A\") filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com under the Company\u2019s profile.\nSecond Quarter 2022 Highlights\nOperations\n-\nGold production: 113,462 ounces, an increase of 22% from Q1 2022 production, driven by strong production and mine development at Lamaque.\n-\nGold sales: 107,631 ounces at an average realized gold price per ounce sold1 of $1,849.\n-\nProduction costs: $109.3 million.\n-\nCash operating costs1: $789 per ounce sold. Costs were primarily driven by lower gold production and an increase in the price of certain commodities and consumables required for safe operations, however the price increases were partly offset by the weakening of local currencies in which costs are incurred, particularly the Turkish Lira and Euro.\n-\nAll-in sustaining costs (\"AISC\")1: $1,270 per ounce sold, driven by higher cash operating costs per ounce sold and sustaining capital expenditures.\n-\nTotal capital expenditures: $83.2 million, including $32.3 million of sustaining capital1, primarily focused on underground development and construction at Lamaque. Growth capital1 of $26.4 million focused on waste stripping at Kisladag and construction of the first phase of the North leach pad to support the mine life extension. $9.1 million of capital expenditures spent at Skouries include advancing site access, completing building enclosures, and geotechnical and drilling activities.\n-\nSkouries growth capital: As a bridge to the completion of a financing package, an additional $30 to $40 million of growth capital will be allocated to the project. Total growth capital at Skouries is now expected to be $60 to $80 million in 2022.\n-\n2022 outlook: We expect production to be second-half weighted and maintain our 2022 production guidance of 460,000 to 490,000 ounces and are tracking toward the lower end of the range as a result of production challenges in Q1 2022. We are updating our 2022 guidance for consolidated cash operating costs1 to $700 to $750 per ounce sold, total cash costs1 to $790 to $840 per ounce sold and AISC1 to $1,180 to $1,280 per ounce sold.\nFinancial\n-\nCash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital1: $48.3 million.\n-\nCash, cash equivalents and term deposits: $370.0 million, as at June 30, 2022.\n-\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"): $89.1 million.\n-\nAdjusted EBITDA1: $87.6 million.\n-\nNet loss: $22.7 million, or a loss of $0.12 per share.\n-\nAdjusted net earnings2: $13.8 million net earnings, or $0.08 earnings per share. Adjusted net earnings removed a $23.3 million loss on foreign exchange due to translation of deferred tax balances, and a $14.4 million loss on the non-cash revaluation of the derivative related to redemption options in our debt.\n-\nFree cash flow2: Negative $62.8 million, primarily due to lower gold production and sales, annual royalty payments and mine standby costs.\n\u201cWe had a steady operational quarter, driven by solid production and higher grades at Lamaque and consistent operations at Efemcukuru,\" said George Burns, Eldorado's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Olympias saw meaningful improvements in the second quarter. At Kisladag, the team focused on increasing the tonnes placed on the pad, which sets up strong third quarter production. We remain confident in our ability to deliver consolidated production guidance of 460,000 to 490,000 ounces and expect to end the year in the lower end of the range,\" added Burns. \"In addition, we revised our 2022 consolidated cost guidance to reflect lower than expected gold production in the first half of the year, continued inflationary pressures, and additional costs associated with the VAT import charge on Olympias gold concentrate shipments into China.\"\n\"Considerable progress was made at Skouries during the quarter, with activity focused on execution readiness and critical path activities in engineering, procurement and siteenabling works. We look forward to updating the market as we continue to work towards financing and Board approval for the restart of construction at Skouries,\" continued Burns.\n\"Additionally, during the quarter we published our 10th annual Sustainability Report. I'm proud of the global team for the progress we've made on our goals and initiatives. Specifically, we have exceeded gender parity on our Board, and demonstrated leadership in regard to local employment and procurement.\"\nConsolidated Financial and Operational Highlights\n|\n| 3 months ended June 30, |\n| 6 months ended June 30, | |||||||||||\n| Continuing operations (5) |\n| 2022 |\n|\n|\n| 2021 |\n|\n|\n| 2022 |\n|\n|\n| 2021 |\n| Revenue | $ | 213.4 |\n|\n| $ | 233.2 |\n|\n| $ | 408.1 |\n|\n| $ | 457.8 |\n| Gold produced (oz) |\n| 113,462 |\n|\n|\n| 116,066 |\n|\n|\n| 206,671 |\n|\n|\n| 227,808 |\n| Gold sold (oz) |\n| 107,631 |\n|\n|\n| 114,140 |\n|\n|\n| 202,103 |\n|\n|\n| 227,734 |\n| Average realized gold price ($/oz sold) (2) | $ | 1,849 |\n|\n| $ | 1,840 |\n|\n| $ | 1,868 |\n|\n| $ | 1,786 |\n| Production costs |\n| 109.3 |\n|\n|\n| 112.8 |\n|\n|\n| 213.9 |\n|\n|\n| 221.4 |\n| Cash operating costs ($/oz sold) (2,3) |\n| 789 |\n|\n|\n| 645 |\n|\n|\n| 810 |\n|\n|\n| 643 |\n| Total cash costs ($/oz sold) (2,3) |\n| 879 |\n|\n|\n| 746 |\n|\n|\n| 908 |\n|\n|\n| 716 |\n| All-in sustaining costs ($/oz sold) (2,3) |\n| 1,270 |\n|\n|\n| 1,074 |\n|\n|\n| 1,306 |\n|\n|\n| 1,030 |\n| Net (loss) earnings for the period (1) |\n| (22.7 | ) |\n|\n| 31.0 |\n|\n|\n| (339.5 | ) |\n|\n| 45.4 |\n| Net (loss) earnings per share \u2013 basic ($/share) (1) |\n| (0.12 | ) |\n|\n| 0.17 |\n|\n|\n| (1.85 | ) |\n|\n| 0.25 |\n| Adjusted net earnings (loss) (1,2) |\n| 13.8 |\n|\n|\n| 29.1 |\n|\n|\n| (5.1 | ) |\n|\n| 54.3 |\n| Adjusted net earnings (loss) per share ($/share) (1,2) |\n| 0.08 |\n|\n|\n| 0.16 |\n|\n|\n| (0.03 | ) |\n|\n| 0.30 |\n| Net cash generated from operating activities (4) |\n| 26.9 |\n|\n|\n| 49.0 |\n|\n|\n| 62.2 |\n|\n|\n| 148.1 |\n| Cash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital (2,4) |\n| 48.3 |\n|\n|\n| 75.9 |\n|\n|\n| 98.1 |\n|\n|\n| 157.0 |\n| Free cash flow (2,4) |\n| (62.8 | ) |\n|\n| (23.7 | ) |\n|\n| (89.6 | ) |\n|\n| 9.7 |\n| Cash, cash equivalents and term deposits | $ | 370.0 |\n|\n| $ | 410.7 |\n|\n| $ | 370.0 |\n|\n| $ | 410.7 |\n(1) Attributable to shareholders of the Company.\n(2) These financial measures or ratios are non-IFRS financial measures or ratios. See the section 'Non-IFRS and Other Financial Measures and Ratios' in the Company's MD&A for explanations and discussion of these non-IFRS financial measures and ratios.\n(3) Revenues from silver, lead and zinc sales are off-set against cash operating costs.\n(4) 2021 amounts have been restated for a voluntary change in accounting policy to classify cash paid for interest on the statement of cash flows as a financing, rather than an operating activity.\n(5) Amounts presented are from continuing operations only. The Brazil segment is presented as a discontinued operation in 2021. See Note 17 of our condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022.\nTotal revenue was $213.4 million in Q2 2022, a decrease of 8% from $233.2 million in Q2 2021 and an increase of 10% from $194.7 million in Q1 2022. Total revenue was $408.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022, a decrease from $457.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. The decreases in both three and six-month periods were due to lower sales volumes and were partially offset by higher average metal prices.\nProduction costs decreased to $109.3 million in Q2 2022 from $112.8 million in Q2 2021 and to $213.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 from $221.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. Decreases in both periods were primarily due to the suspension of operations at Stratoni at the end of 2021. Production costs at Stratoni totalled $13.7 million in Q2 2021 and $29.0 million in the six months ended June 30, 2021. These decreases were partly offset by increases in certain production costs in Q2 2022 as a result of supply concerns caused by financial and trade sanctions against Russia, and ongoing supply chain challenges due to COVID-19. Cost increases primarily impacted electricity at operations in Greece and Turkiye, and fuel and reagents at Kisladag.\nCash operating costs in Q2 2022 averaged $789 per ounce sold, an increase from $645 in Q2 2021, and cash operating costs per ounce sold averaged $810 in the six months ended June 30, 2022, an increase from $643 in the six months ended June 30, 2021. Increases in both three and six-month periods were primarily due to lower production, lower silver and base metal sales which reduce cash operating costs as by-product credits, and lower-grade ore mined and processed at Kisladag, resulting in fewer ounces produced and sold.\nAISC per ounce sold averaged $1,270 in Q2 2022, an increase from $1,074 in Q2 2021, and AISC per ounce sold averaged $1,306 in the six months ended June 30, 2022, an increase from $1,030 in the six months ended June 30, 2021. Increases in both three and six-month periods primarily reflect the increases in cash operating costs per ounce sold, combined with higher sustaining capital expenditures.\nWe reported net loss attributable to shareholders from continuing operations of $22.7 million ($0.12 loss per share) in Q2 2022 compared to net earnings of $31.0 million ($0.17 per share) in Q2 2021 and net loss of $339.5 million ($1.85 loss per share) in the six months ended June 30, 2022 compared to net earnings of $45.4 million ($0.25 per share) in the six months ended June 30, 2021. The net loss in the six months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily due to the impairment of the Certej project, a non-core gold asset, the write-down of decommissioned equipment at Kisladag, lower sales volumes, higher mine standby costs and higher income tax expense.\nAdjusted net earnings were $13.8 million ($0.08 per share) in Q2 2022 compared to $29.1 million ($0.16 per share) in Q2 2021. Adjusted net earnings in Q2 2022 removed a $23.3 million loss on foreign exchange due to translation of deferred tax balances, a $14.4 million loss on the non-cash revaluation of the derivative related to redemption options in our debt and included a $1.2 million partial reversal of Stratoni equipment write-downs.\nQuarterly Operations Update\n|\n| 3 months ended June 30, | 6 months ended June 30, | |||||||||\n|\n|\n| 2022 |\n|\n| 2021 |\n|\n| 2022 |\n|\n| 2021 |\n| Consolidated |\n|\n|\n|\n| |||||||\n| Ounces produced |\n| 113,462 |\n|\n| 116,066 |\n|\n| 206,671 |\n|\n| 227,808 |\n| Ounces sold |\n| 107,631 |\n|\n| 114,140 |\n|\n| 202,103 |\n|\n| 227,734 |\n| Production costs (1) | $ | 109.3 |\n| $ | 112.8 |\n| $ | 213.9 |\n| $ | 221.4 |\n| Cash operating costs ($/oz sold) (2,3) | $ | 789 |\n| $ | 645 |\n| $ | 810 |\n| $ | 643 |\n| All-in sustaining costs ($/oz sold) (2,3) | $ | 1,270 |\n| $ | 1,074 |\n| $ | 1,306 |\n| $ | 1,030 |\n| Sustaining capital expenditures (3) | $ | 32.3 |\n| $ | 24.2 |\n| $ | 56.8 |\n| $ | 44.7 |\n| Kisladag |\n|\n|\n|\n| |||||||\n| Ounces produced |\n| 27,973 |\n|\n| 44,016 |\n|\n| 57,753 |\n|\n| 90,188 |\n| Ounces sold |\n| 26,881 |\n|\n| 44,049 |\n|\n| 56,659 |\n|\n| 91,555 |\n| Production costs | $ | 25.1 |\n| $ | 28.6 |\n| $ | 55.2 |\n| $ | 54.9 |\n| Cash operating costs ($/oz sold) (2,3) | $ | 798 |\n| $ | 529 |\n| $ | 831 |\n| $ | 510 |\n| All-in sustaining costs ($/oz sold) (2,3) | $ | 1,090 |\n| $ | 728 |\n| $ | 1,087 |\n| $ | 665 |\n| Sustaining capital expenditures (3) | $ | 4.3 |\n| $ | 3.7 |\n| $ | 6.8 |\n| $ | 6.5 |\n| Lamaque |\n|\n|\n|\n| |||||||\n| Ounces produced |\n| 46,917 |\n|\n| 35,643 |\n|\n| 80,294 |\n|\n| 64,478 |\n| Ounces sold |\n| 45,655 |\n|\n| 34,677 |\n|\n| 79,780 |\n|\n| 63,755 |\n| Production costs | $ | 31.5 |\n| $ | 24.0 |\n| $ | 58.7 |\n| $ | 47.0 |\n| Cash operating costs ($/oz sold) (2,3) | $ | 657 |\n| $ | 658 |\n| $ | 703 |\n| $ | 704 |\n| All-in sustaining costs ($/oz sold) (2,3) | $ | 985 |\n| $ | 1,065 |\n| $ | 1,069 |\n| $ | 1,109 |\n| Sustaining capital expenditures (3) | $ | 13.5 |\n| $ | 11.0 |\n| $ | 26.5 |\n| $ | 20.3 |\n| Efemcukuru |\n|\n|\n|\n| |||||||\n| Ounces produced |\n| 22,793 |\n|\n| 23,473 |\n|\n| 43,849 |\n|\n| 46,771 |\n| Ounces sold |\n| 23,428 |\n|\n| 23,006 |\n|\n| 44,810 |\n|\n| 47,136 |\n| Production costs | $ | 20.6 |\n| $ | 17.9 |\n| $ | 37.5 |\n| $ | 32.5 |\n| Cash operating costs ($/oz sold) (2,3) | $ | 706 |\n| $ | 525 |\n| $ | 678 |\n| $ | 525 |\n| All-in sustaining costs ($/oz sold) (2,3) | $ | 1,180 |\n| $ | 917 |\n| $ | 1,093 |\n| $ | 802 |\n| Sustaining capital expenditures (3) | $ | 5.9 |\n| $ | 3.8 |\n| $ | 9.4 |\n| $ | 6.3 |\n| Olympias |\n|\n|\n|\n| |||||||\n| Ounces produced |\n| 15,779 |\n|\n| 12,934 |\n|\n| 24,775 |\n|\n| 26,371 |\n| Ounces sold |\n| 11,667 |\n|\n| 12,409 |\n|\n| 20,854 |\n|\n| 25,288 |\n| Production costs | $ | 32.1 |\n| $ | 28.5 |\n| $ | 62.4 |\n| $ | 57.9 |\n| Cash operating costs ($/oz sold) (2,3) | $ | 1,446 |\n| $ | 1,237 |\n| $ | 1,447 |\n| $ | 1,190 |\n| All-in sustaining costs ($/oz sold) (2,3) | $ | 2,346 |\n| $ | 1,893 |\n| $ | 2,369 |\n| $ | 1,845 |\n| Sustaining capital expenditures (3) | $ | 8.5 |\n| $ | 5.7 |\n| $ | 14.1 |\n| $ | 11.5 |\n(1) Includes production costs of Stratoni (base metals production) in 2021 (Q2 2021: $13.7 million, YTD 2021: $29.0 million).

See the section 'Non-IFRS and Other Financial Measures and Ratios' in the Company's MD&A for explanations and discussion of these non-IFRS financial measures and ratios.\nKisladag\nKisladag produced 27,973 ounces of gold in Q2 2022, a decrease of 36% from 44,016 ounces in Q2 2021. The expected decrease in production was due to lower tonnes placed on the heap leach pad in the first quarter due to COVID-19 related absenteeism, severe weather and a government-mandated power outage. Average grade of 0.76 grams per tonne in Q2 2022 decreased slightly from 0.81 grams per tonne in Q2 2021 but increased from 0.61 grams per tonne in Q1 2022.\nOre tonnes placed on the heap leach pad in Q2 2022 increased 40% from Q1 2022 as production ramped up in the quarter following snowfall and prolonged freezing temperatures in Q1 2022 that impacted the ore conveyance and stacking system, reducing productivity. However, tonnes placed in the quarter were lower than in Q2 2021 due to continued optimization of the high-pressure grinding roll circuit (\"HPGR\") and debottlenecking of the belt agglomeration circuit. The HPGR is performing to plan with recovery rates as expected. Increased tonnes placed on the heap leach pad in Q2 2022 are expected to positively impact gold production in the second half of 2022.\nRevenue decreased to $51.0 million in Q2 2022 from $80.7 million in Q2 2021, reflecting lower sales in the quarter and partly offset by an increase in the average realized gold price.\nProduction costs decreased to $25.1 million in Q2 2022 from $28.6 million in Q2 2021 primarily due to a reduction in consumables used in line with lower production and efficiencies from the HPGR circuit, and weakening of the Turkish Lira. These savings were partly offset by price increases in labour, reagents, electricity, and fuel. Lower production, combined with lower grade, resulted in an increase in cash operating costs per ounce sold to $798 in Q2 2022 from $529 in Q2 2021.\nAISC per ounce sold increased to $1,090 in Q2 2022 from $728 in Q2 2021 primarily due to the increase in cash operating costs per ounce sold.\nSustaining capital expenditures of $4.3 million in Q2 2022 and $6.8 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 primarily included equipment rebuilds and processing improvements.\nGrowth capital expenditures of $23.7 million in Q2 2022 and $43.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 included waste stripping to support the mine life extension and construction of the first phase of the North heap leach pad.\nIn conjunction with the North heap leach pad, we are investing in additional higher-capacity mobile conveyors which are expected to enhance materials handling capabilities in the belt agglomeration circuit and increase throughput. Installation is expected to be complete in late 2022. We are also installing an agglomeration drum, expected to be commissioned in the first half of 2023, which is expected to improve the quality, consistency and permeability of the agglomeration process. With these investments, stacking is expected to continue on the existing heap leach pad until mid-2023, at which time stacking is expected to commence on the North heap leach pad.\nLamaque\nLamaque produced 46,917 ounces of gold in Q2 2022, an increase of 32% from 35,643 ounces in Q2 2021 due to strong throughput and higher grade. The expected increase in production from Q1 2022 also resulted from higher throughput combined with the development of higher-grade stopes following delays in the first quarter due to COVID-19 related absenteeism. Average grade increased to 6.63 grams per tonne in Q2 2022 from 5.98 grams per tonne in Q2 2021 and from 5.27 grams per tonne in Q1 2022.\nRevenue increased to $85.0 million in Q2 2022 from $63.5 million in Q2 2021 due to higher production in the quarter, combined with a higher average realized gold price.\nProduction costs increased to $31.5 million in Q2 2022 from $24.0 million in Q2 2021, primarily due to higher production in the quarter. Cash operating costs per ounce sold remained consistent at $657 in Q2 2022 from $658 in Q2 2021, due to higher production and cost savings from a weaker Canadian dollar being partly offset by cost increases for consumables.\nAISC per ounce sold decreased to $985 in Q2 2022 from $1,065 in Q2 2021 primarily due to higher gold production in the quarter, partly offset by a modest increase in sustaining capital expenditure.\nSustaining capital expenditures of $13.5 million in Q2 2022 and $26.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 primarily included underground development and construction. Growth capital expenditures of $0.9 million in Q2 2022 and $2.7 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily construction of underground infrastructure.\nEfemcukuru\nEfemcukuru produced 22,793 payable ounces of gold in Q2 2022, a 3% decrease from 23,473 payable ounces in Q2 2021. The decrease was due to a planned decrease in grade to 5.96 grams per tonne in Q2 2022 from 6.60 grams per tonne in Q2 2021, and was partly offset by higher throughput in the quarter.\nRevenue decreased to $41.4 million in Q2 2022 from $45.0 million in Q2 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a lower average realized gold price during Q2 2022 as a result of downward revaluations of provisional pricing in the quarter in line with movements in the gold price.\nProduction costs increased to $20.6 million in Q2 2022 from $17.9 million in Q2 2021 primarily due to increased tonnes processed, combined with cost increases in electricity, and consumables. The increase in production costs, combined with lower production in the quarter, resulted in an increase in cash operating costs per ounce sold to $706 in Q2 2022 from $525 in Q2 2021.\nAISC per ounce sold increased to $1,180 in Q2 2022 from $917 in Q2 2021, primarily due to the increase in cash operating costs per ounce sold combined with higher sustaining capital expenditure.\nSustaining capital expenditures of $5.9 million in Q2 2022 and $9.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily underground development and equipment rebuilds. Growth capital expenditures of $0.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 included resource conversion drilling at Kokarpinar.\nOlympias\nOlympias produced 15,779 ounces of gold in Q2 2022, a 22% increase from 12,934 ounces in Q2 2021 and primarily reflected higher average gold grade, despite slightly lower processing volumes. Lead, silver and zinc production also increased in Q2 2022 as compared to Q2 2021 as a result of higher average grades. Transformation initiatives continued to show positive results as the mine continues to ramp up productivity.\nProcessing volumes increased in the latter part of Q2 2022 as a result of processing ore stockpiles following lower processing volumes in the first quarter due to COVID-19 related absenteeism and power outages related to heavy snowfall in the region in January 2022. Water treatment plant improvements continued in the quarter with minimal impact on throughput.\nRevenue increased to $36.3 million in Q2 2022 from $34.1 million in Q2 2021 primarily as a result of higher gold prices in the quarter, despite lower sales volumes due to timing of concentrate shipments. Gold revenue was also impacted during the quarter by the 13% VAT import charge levied on customers importing Olympias gold concentrate into China. This import charge, effective since October 1, 2021, reduces revenue by a corresponding amount. China was the primary destination of Olympias gold concentrate in Q2 2022 as planned shipments to Russia were halted earlier in the year as a result of sanctions imposed on Russia due to the Russia-Ukraine war. Revenue from lead-silver concentrate sales increased in the quarter and revenue from zinc concentrate sales decreased in the quarter, in both cases due to timing of bulk shipments.\nProduction costs increased to $32.1 million in Q2 2022 from $28.5 million in Q2 2021 reflecting price increases in electricity, fuel, and other consumables. Cash operating costs per ounce sold increased to $1,446 in Q2 2022 from $1,237 in Q2 2021, primarily a result of lower throughput, certain production cost increases and the 13% VAT import charge which is included in cash operating costs. These increases were partly offset by higher gold grade and higher revenue from silver and base metal sales, which reduce cash operating costs as by-product credits. Electricity prices in the quarter remained above Q1 2021 levels but reduced from Q1 2022 due to subsidies that lowered the effective average price.\nAISC per ounce sold increased to $2,346 in Q2 2022 from $1,893 in Q2 2021 primarily due to the increase in cash operating costs per ounce sold, combined with an increase in sustaining capital expenditure.\nSustaining capital expenditures of $8.5 million in Q2 2022 and $14.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 primarily included underground development and expansion of tailings facilities. Growth capital expenditures of $1.7 million in Q2 2022 and $3.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily underground development.\nCorporate Updates\nIn July 2022, we completed the acquisition of 32.5 million common shares of G Mining Ventures Corp.

The base case assumed that all ore is processed through a standard sulphide circuit, which means that the partially oxidised material at the surface, which does not float, ends up being treated as zero value waste. If we can turn that material into cash generating ore by leaching with glycine and cyanide, it has potential to drive significant value uplift for the Kharmagtai project.\u201d\nMetallurgical Recoveries\nResults from bottle roll tests at varying cyanide and glycine addition rates were conducted using 2.5 kilograms per tonne (kg/t) cyanide and 2.5kg/t glycine tests over a 48-hour conventional leach time, shown in Table 1.\nTable 1: Gold, silver and copper recoveries at 2.5kg/t cyanide and 2.5kg/t glycine addition\n| Sample | Recovery (%) | |\n| Gold | Copper | |\n| 1 | 88.5 | 20.1 |\n| 2 | 82.3 | 13.1 |\n| 3 | 91.4 | 45.8 |\n| 4 | 70.3 | 31.9 |\nThese results demonstrate achievement of high gold recoveries at modest cyanide addition rates and in the presence of significant cyanide soluble copper. The coarse particle size indicates that heap leach treatment may be feasible.\nGenerally, gold leaching increases with decreasing particle size, providing a larger specific surface area for solution contact. Gold recoveries are expected to improve by grinding to 150 micrometre (\u00b5m) particle size, typically used for Carbon in Leach (CIL) processing.\nCyanide and glycine consumption was relatively low, indicating high potential for recovering and recycling of both reagents via the eventual optimal processing route. The addition of glycine reduced the cyanide consumption versus the cyanide consumption when leached using traditional cyanidation. Actual cyanide consumption rates ranged from 1.6kg/t to 2.1kg/t.\nTest Program Scope\nThere is up to 90Mt of partially oxidised material at Kharmagtai, with 80% located near surface at Stockwork Hill, White Hill and Golden Eagle. If this material was processed as ore rather than pre-stripping, it could reduce waste rock production by approx. 10%.\nThe scope of the test program included head grade analysis and combined cyanide and glycine leach test work on four composite samples of previously untested, partially oxidised material from the upper 30m across the Kharmagtai mineralised system. The objective of the leach tests was to determine metallurgical recovery of gold and copper, and gauge potential of glycine addition to enhance recovery and reduce cyanide consumption. These results will inform future variability test work to evaluate an optimal processing route for this material.\nLeaching with Glycine and Cyanide\nCyanide and glycine leaching was investigated on this partially oxidised material. Low cyanide addition, coupled with a glycine-dominant lixiviant, has many beneficial properties, particularly for leaching of precious metals with elevated copper content. This occurs due to copper preferentially bonding to glycine rather than cyanide, thus freeing the cyanide to leach gold.\nGlycine is a widely available bulk reagent with characteristics favourable for use in mineralogical processing; non-toxic, water soluble, stable, non-volatile and can be recycled. Under alkaline conditions, glycine forms stable complexes with precious and base metals but not with iron, magnesium, or manganese.\nMetallurgical test work was undertaken by Perth based Mining and Process Solutions (MPS), who hold the rights for leaching metals using glycine with cyanide.\nSample Selection and Preparation\nFour composite samples were collected from Stockwork Hill, White Hill and Golden Eagle deposits at Kharmagtai project, as being representative of each of these zones. Samples were coarse rejects (P80>2mm particle size), consisting of mixed oxide and sulphide material taken from previously drilled diamond core holes. There is a risk that aged diamond core will deliver lower metallurgical recovery than test work on newly drilled material, due to post-drilling oxidation. Care was taken during sample selection to avoid those exhibiting evidence of post-drilling oxidation.\nSample preparation consisted of homogenising and splitting samples \u201cas received\u201d into their respective composites and labelling \u201cSample 1\u201d through to \u201cSample 4\u201d, with no further crushing or grinding. Each split was rotary split and homogenised for head analysis and sub-samples taken for test work. Head assays for Au, Silver (Ag) & Cu were conducted by fire assay for each sample. Prior to leach test work, samples were cured in 10k grams per tonne (g/t) sulfuric acid for 24 hours to improve copper extraction.\nMetallurgical sample locations, zones and head assay grades are detailed in Table 2.

(the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cTorex\u201d) (TSX: TXG) reports the Company\u2019s financial and operational results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022. The Company will host a conference call tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM (ET) to discuss the quarterly results.\nTorex is also pleased to announce the appointment of Mr. Rodrigo Sandoval to its Board of Directors.\nJody Kuzenko, President & CEO of Torex, stated:\n\u201cTorex delivered solid results across multiple fronts in Q2. Our strong production, combined with ongoing discipline in cost containment, resulted in robust revenue, operating cash flow, and free cash flow generation this quarter. With more than $310 million in cash on hand, strong forecasted cash flow from ELG, and advanced stage plans to increase our available credit facility to $250 million, Torex is in a very favourable position to fund the development of Media Luna while continuing to invest in value-generating exploration.\n\u201cOur excellent operational performance this quarter was primarily driven by higher grades from the ELG open pits as well as record mining rates in the ELG Underground. Underground mining rates averaged 1,582 tonnes per day in Q2, well surpassing the prior record of 1,429 tonnes per day achieved in the same quarter last year. With completion of Portal #3 expected later this year and potential to leverage long hole open stoping in portions of the mine, we are steadily making gains toward achieving our long-term target of 2,000 tonnes per day in the ELG Underground.\n\u201cAt Media Luna, project activity continues to ramp up following Board approval on March 31st. Earthworks have progressed as planned during the quarter, and advance rates continued to improve in both the Guajes Tunnel and South Portal Lower. Procurement activities are well underway, with the key focus on long lead items including flotation cells, regrind mills, the Guajes Tunnel conveyor, and the battery electric fleet. As of June 30th, physical progress on the Media Luna Project was approximately 5%, exactly in line with our plan.\n\u201cBased on a detailed review of scheduled cost flows for Media Luna, the Company has redistributed the timing of indirect costs associated with freight, import taxes, and contingency. As a result, non-sustaining capital expenditure guidance for Media Luna in 2022 has been lowered to $170 to $210 million from $220 million to $270 million. While the timing of these expenditures has been shifted to 2023 and 2024, the overall cost to develop Media Luna remains unchanged.\n\u201cDespite challenging headwinds with the current inflationary environment and the persistence of COVID-19, we delivered a very solid first half of 2022, and we are well on track to deliver on production and cost guidance for the fourth year in a row.\"\nRichard Howes, Chair of the Board, stated:\n\u201cWe are very pleased to welcome Rodrigo Sandoval to the Torex Board of Directors. Rodrigo brings significant social, commercial and political knowledge and experience from within Mexico\u2019s mining industry, which will serve to enhance the overall governance of the Company. With Rodrigo\u2019s appointment, we have now completed the process started two years ago to refresh, strengthen and diversify the competencies and skills of our Board.\u201d\nSECOND QUARTER 2022 HIGHLIGHTS\n-\nSafety excellence continues: No lost time injuries in the quarter. The Company exited the quarter with a lost time injury frequency rate of zero per million hours worked on a rolling 12-month basis and surpassed 10 million hours worked without a lost time injury in June.\n-\nGold production: Delivered gold production of 123,185 ounces for the quarter. Gold production is on track to meet full year production guidance of 430,000 to 470,000 ounces.\n-\nGold sold: Sold 123,363 ounces of gold at an average realized gold price1 of $1,865 per ounce, contributing to revenue of $235.0 million.\n-\nTotal cash costs1 and all-in sustaining costs1: Total cash costs of $703 per ounce sold and all-in sustaining costs of $911 per ounce sold. The Company is on track to deliver on full year total cash costs guidance of $695 to $735 per ounce as well as all-in sustaining costs guidance of $980 to $1,030 per ounce given ongoing cost management to minimize the impact of inflationary pressures.\n-\nNet income and adjusted net earnings1: Reported net income of $70.3 million or earnings of $0.82 per share on a basic basis and $0.80 per share on a diluted basis. Adjusted net earnings of $57.0 million or $0.66 per share on a basic basis and $0.66 per share on a diluted basis. Net income includes an unrealized derivative gain of $17.0 million related to gold price contracts entered into during Q1 2022 to reduce downside price risk during the construction of the Media Luna Project (approximately 25% of production between October 2022 to December 2023).\n-\nEBITDA1 and adjusted EBITDA1: Generated EBITDA of $155.9 million and adjusted EBITDA of $137.1 million.\n-\nCash flow from operations: Cash flow from operations totalled $126.9 million and $120.6 million prior to changes in non-cash operating working capital. Cash flow from operations includes $18.6 million of income taxes paid and a payment of $21.5 million in relation to mandated profit sharing in Mexico for 2021.\n-\nFree cash flow1: Free cash flow of $74.0 million including total capital expenditures of $52.5 million.\n-\nNet cash1 and financial liquidity: Net cash of $306.3 million, including $310.7 million in cash and $4.4 million of lease obligations, with no debt and an undrawn $150.0 million credit facility, providing more than $460 million in available liquidity as at June 30, 2022.

The Company\u2019s principal asset is the Morelos Complex, which includes the El Lim\u00f3n Guajes (\u201cELG\u201d) Mining Complex, the Media Luna Project, the processing plant and related infrastructure. Commercial production from the Morelos Complex commenced on April 1, 2016 and an updated Technical Report for the Morelos Complex was released in March 2022. Torex\u2019s key strategic objectives are to extend and optimize production from the ELG Mining Complex, de-risk and advance Media Luna to commercial production, build on ESG excellence, and to grow through ongoing exploration across the entire Morelos Property.\nFor further information, please contact:\n|\n|\n|\n| Jody Kuzenko | Dan Rollins |\n| President and CEO | Senior Vice President, Corporate Development & Investor Relations |\n| Direct: (647) 725-9982 | Direct: (647) 260-1503 |\n| jody.kuzenko@torexgold.com | dan.rollins@torexgold.com |\nCAUTIONARY NOTE\nForward Looking Information\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" and \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation. Forward-looking information also includes, but is not limited to, statements that: With more than $310 million in cash on hand, robust forecasted cash flow from ELG, and advanced stage plans to increase the Company\u2019s available credit facility to $250 million, Torex is in a very favourable position to fund the development of Media Luna while continuing to invest in value-generating exploration; with completion of Portal #3 expected later this year and potential to leverage long hole open stoping in portions of the mine, the Company is steadily making gains toward achieving its long-term target of 2,000 tonnes per day in the ELG Underground; the lowered guidance of non-sustaining capital expenditure guidance for Media Luna in 2022 to $170 to $210 million from $220 million to $270 million; while the timing of these non-sustaining capital expenditures has been shifted to 2023 and 2024, the overall cost to develop Media Luna remains unchanged; the Company is well on track to deliver on production and cost guidance for the fourth year in a row; gold production is on track to meet full year production guidance of 430,000 to 470,000 ounces; the Company is on track to deliver on full year total cash costs guidance of $695 to $735 per ounce as well as all-in sustaining costs guidance of $980 to $1,030 per ounce; the gold price contracts were entered into during Q1 2022 to reduce downside price risk during the construction of the Media Luna Project; the expectation of extending and increasing the available credit facilities with a syndicate of international banks; the expectation that these credit facilities will be executed in Q3 2022 and provide the Company with a total of $250 million in available credit with a maturity date in 2025; the Media Luna long-lead procurement and earthworks are on schedule; and Torex\u2019s key strategic objectives are to extend and optimize production from the ELG Mining Complex, de-risk and advance Media Luna to commercial production, build on ESG excellence, and to grow through ongoing exploration across the entire Morelos Property..

Lower metal sales volumes due to low production, offset partially by higher realized prices for gold, resulted in a decrease in revenue to $30.0 million from $39.0 million for Q2 2021. Mine operating income for Q2 2022 was $0.1 million compared with a mine operating loss of $2.7 million for Q2 2021.\nNet working capital was negative $39.2 million compared with $0.2 million at December 31, 2021. For Q2 2022, the Company had cash inflows from operating activities of $8.3 million and incurred cash outflows from investing activities of $13.6 million.\nOperational Highlights\nQ2 2022 | Q2 2021 | Six months | Six months | |\nContinuing Operations | ||||\nTotal material mined (tonnes) | 7,716,376 | 5,678,601 | 12,089,102 | 12,577,182 |\nOre mined (tonnes) | 291,160 | 211,913 | 523,373 | 559,379 |\nTonnes milled | 870,199 | 873,433 | 1,743,332 | 1,669,469 |\nPlant gold head grade (g/t) | 0.69 | 0.81 | 0.63 | 0.85 |\nGold oz produced | 16,629 | 20,696 | 30,666 | 43,692 |\nGold oz sold | 16,076 | 21,459 | 30,469 | 44,480 |\nCash costs per gold oz sold | $ 1,575 | $ 1,617 | $ 1,689 | $ 1,289 |\nAISC per gold oz sold, excluding corporate G&A expenditures | $ 3,080 | $ 2,214 | $ 2,856 | $ 1,870 |\nAISC per gold oz sold | $ 3,299 | $ 2,383 | $ 3,048 | $ 2,051 |\nDiscontinued Operations | ||||\nOre mined | 17,022 | 55,658 | 33,280 | 112,634 |\nTonnes milled | 17,236 | 55,997 | 33,468 | 114,665 |\nSilver produced | 159,529 | 334,423 | 333,227 | 694,493 |\nProduction from Tucano during the second quarter was in line with expectations as stripping continued to advance in preparation for accessing main ore lenses and consequently better grades in the second half of 2022. Mobilization of the new mining contractor, MINAX, continues to advance, and mobilization of the required equipment for the 2022 mine plan is expected to be complete by September 2022. During this period of mobilization, the current mining contractor, U&M, and MINAX have been working in tandem, which contributed to an increase in mined tonnage in Q2 2022 compared with the previous quarter.\nOutlook\nThe Company's Tucano operation is on track to meet previously announced production guidance for 2022 of 85,000 to 100,000 Au oz. As disclosed in the Company's news release dated January 19, 2022, the second half of 2022 is expected to account for a least 65% of annual production guidance. The mine plan for Tucano reflects more stripping in the first half of 2022 and therefore consolidated AISC is expected to be higher in the first half of 2022 compared with the second half. Following the sale of the Company's Mexican assets, guidance shown in the table below is for continuing operations only.\nDue to a combination of inflationary pressures and accelerated capital spending specifically on the Tucano tailings facility, the Company has determined that Tucano cost guidance for the year must be adjusted. Inflationary pressures have had a significant impact on operating costs, including on diesel and other key consumables, when compared to the same period in 2021. In addition, due to higher-than-normal precipitation in the past two years, an increase in capital spending was necessary to fast track the Company's expansion of the Tucano tailings storage facility, which brought forward $3.5 million planned for 2023, as well as a $2.3 million investment in evaporators to manage water levels in the tailings facilities. Alterations in a number of aspects of the mine plan, which will produce benefits in future quarters, further impacted costs. Revised 2022 guidance on costs is stated in the table below:\nGuidance for Continuing Operations1\nPrevious | Revised | |\nGold Production (oz) | 85,000 \u2013 100,000 | 85,000 \u2013 100,000 |\nCash Costs ($/Au oz sold)2 | $1,200 - $1,300 | $1,400 - $1,500 |\nAISC ($/Au oz sold) 3 | $1,600 - $1,700 | $2,200 - $2,300 |\nProduction and AISC guidance here and elsewhere in this news release is forward-looking information that should be read in conjunction with the Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements section at the end of this news release and the Company's most recently filed Management Discussion and Analysis for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022 (\"MD&A\"). The Company may revise guidance during the year to reflect actual results to date and those anticipated for the remainder of the year.\nThe Company has determined that it will require further financing to meet long-term objectives, improve working capital, fund planned capital investments and exploration programs for its operating mines, and meet scheduled debt repayment obligations and will be considering additional equity financing (including through use of the ATM facility) and/or debt financing.\nRefer to the Company's MD&A for more details of the financial results and for reconciliations of the Company's non-GAAP performance measures to the nearest GAAP measure. The full version of the Company's unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, and 2021 annual consolidated financial statements and MD&A can be viewed on the Company's website at www.greatpanther.com, on SEDAR at www.sedar.com or on EDGAR at www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml. All financial information is prepared in accordance with IFRS, except as noted in the Non-GAAP Measures section of the Company's MD&A.\n___________________ | |\n1 | The production and revised cost guidance for 2022 assumes no COVID-19 related shutdowns, the Company being able to maintain geotechnical control/stability of the UCS pit and access of the mineralization in the UCS pit, based on completion of the planned additional technical work and in accordance with the revised Tucano mine plan and without additional costs or significant interruption. |\n2 | Cash cost per oz sold are calculated based on the total cash operating costs with the deduction of revenue attributable to sales of by-product metals, net of the respective smelting and refining charges. |\n3 | AISC refers to all-in sustaining cost per gold ounce sold, excluding corporate general and administrative expenditures, and reflects the AISC at the Company's operating mines. The calculation starts with cash cost net of by-product revenue and adds accretion of reclamation provisions, lease liability payments, sustaining exploration, evaluation and development expenses, and sustaining capital expenditures for the operating mines. Sustaining expenditures are those costs incurred to sustain and maintain existing assets at current productive capacity and constant planned levels of productive output. AISC is a non-GAAP measure. This measure is widely used in the mining industry as a benchmark for performance but does not have a standardized meaning as prescribed by IFRS as an indicator of performance and may differ from methods used by other companies with similar descriptions. Refer to the Non-GAAP Measures section of the Company's MD&A for the period ending June 30,2022, for a reconciliation of AISC to the Company's financial statement measures. The Company's AISC guidance assumes a Brazilian real to US dollar exchange rate of 5.35 for the third and fourth quarter of 2022. Actual results may differ. |\nWEBCAST AND CONFERENCE CALL\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast to discuss Q2 2022 financial and operating results on Thursday, August 4, 2022, at 9:00 AM PT/12:00 PM ET.\nLive webcast and registration: https://www.greatpanther.com/investors/webcasts/\nConference Call:\nCanada and US Toll-Free: + 1 800 319 4610\nInternational Toll: + 1 604 638 5340\nA replay of the webcast will be available on the Webcasts section of Great Panther's website.

(TSXV:CDB)(OTCQB:CDBMF), has reported initial diamond drilling results from its ongoing drilling program at the San Matias Copper-Gold-Silver Project in Colombia. Ivanhoe Electric owns a 63.27% interest in Cordoba Minerals with the San Matias Copper-Gold-Silver Project itself being owned 100% by Cordoba Minerals.\nHighlights:\n6,385 meters (24 diamond drill holes) of the initial 25,000-meter in-fill drilling program have been completed within the Alacran Deposit.\nSignificant assays returned to date include (see Table 1 for full drill results):\nACD087 - 61 meters with 0.99% copper, 0.35 g/t gold and 5.17 g/t silver or 1.17% copper equivalent (CuEq 1 ).\nACD097 - 53 meters with 0.70% copper, 0.70 g/t gold and 6.18 g/t silver or 1.11% CuEq 1 .\nMineralized intersections correlate closely with Cordoba Minerals' previously disclosed Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) Mineral Resource block model.\nMultiple late-mineral gold-copper veins, known as Carbonate Base Metal (CBM) veins, have been intersected within drill holes and are superimposed upon high-grade zones of earlier carbonate replacement copper-gold mineralization.\n\"We are excited to see the initial in-fill drill holes supporting the higher grade domains in the resource model for the Alacran Deposit. The fact that these domains also host multiple CBM veins brings Cordoba one step closer to understanding the relationship between the CBM and carbonate replacement events,\" commented Sarah Armstrong-Montoya, President and CEO of Cordoba.\n\"Results indicate a shared feeder system for the mineralizing fluids and point towards excellent exploration potential to depth, including for a porphyry copper-gold source.\"\nInitial drill results show strong correlation with Cordoba's previously announced PFS resource block model\nCordoba commenced an initial 25,000-meter in-fill drill program in May 2022, which is part of the 40,000-meter in-fill drilling campaign planned by it to update its previously disclosed mineral resource and mine plan at Alacran. This initial drill program focuses on the northern and central areas within the Alacran Deposit which hosts high-grade mineralized zones with considerable widths (Figure 1).\nCordoba reports that a total of 6,385 meters in 24 diamond drill holes of the initial drill program have been completed to date. The initial drill assays confirm not only the wide higher grade domains of chalcopyrite-pyrrhotite copper-gold carbonate replacement mineralization within the mineral resource block model but also the presence of multiple late-mineral CBM veins (Figures 2 to 5).\nCBM veins offer significant upside potential for contained gold in the Alacran Deposit\nCBM veins are a style of structurally-controlled gold, silver and base metal mineralization found in association with porphyry intrusions. Spectacularly large and high-grade examples include the Porgera gold deposit in Papua New Guinea and the Buritica deposit in Colombia.\nThe average grade of the CBM veins identified within Alacran Deposit is unknown. Bonanza grade gold was previously reported by Cordoba in January 2017 in drill hole ACD036 (see Table 2), which returned 0.90 meters of 4,440 g/t gold, 10.25% copper, 24.70% zinc and 347 g/t silver (Figure 6).\nIn-fill drill holes ACD087, ACD097, ACD114 and ACD115 during the current campaign have intersected en-echelon CBM veins overprinting earlier chalcopyrite-pyrrhotite copper-gold carbonate replacement mineralization. The predominance of arsenopyrite with minor pyrite and sphalerite in the CBM veins, coupled with the pervasive chlorite-white mica alteration and carbonate gangue, is diagnostic of an intermediate sulfidation epithermal event. There is significant potential for these veins to extend to depth, potentially towards a causative porphyry intrusion.\nIt is difficult to currently assess how much gold these CBM veins may contain within the Alacran Deposit. However, given the clear presence of coarse-grained gold, as demonstrated in drill hole ACD036, it is likely that there is a significant nugget-effect at play. Should that be substantiated it provides the potential for an increase in contained gold that is not reflected in the current mineral resource statement of Cordoba.\nTable 1: 2022 Alacran Deposit initial drill program results.

The Blue Lake Porphyry is evidently a very large, well-mineralized system, with a number of overprinting events that have introduced gold and copper. In particular, those which are manifested as quartz stockwork veins and bornite mineralization will be the focus of ongoing drill targeting at Blue Lake. A very expansive silica-clay lithocap connecting Blue Lake with the A1 Prospect is virtually untested by drilling and has the potential to host multiple gold-copper mineralized porphyries.\nThis resource declaration is the fifth largest known mineralized porphyry in Papua New Guinea in terms of pre-mined contained gold equivalent ounces, after the world famous Golpu, Panguna, Ok Tedi and Frieda River porphyry deposits.\nIt is truly remarkable to be able to look down upon the Lae-Madang Highway, a major transport route to the Lae International Port, while standing on an outcropping undeveloped resource containing in excess of 10 million gold equivalent ounces, and as much as 15 million ounces using a lower cut-off grade.\u201d\nJohn Lewins, K92 CEO and Director, added, \u201cThe maiden resource estimate at Blue Lake is a major accomplishment, defining a large-scale, potentially commerical gold-copper porphyry proximal to our high-grade Kainantu underground mine. Blue Lake was also defined efficiently, leveraging our team\u2019s extensive exploration experience in Papua New Guinea, with nearly all holes intersecting mineralization and only 16,475 metres of drilling to define 10.8 million ounces AuEq or 4.7 billion lbs CuEq of inferred resource \u2013 implying an average discovery rate of aproximately 650 oz AuEq per metre drilled.\nImportantly, we believe Blue Lake is only the tip of the porphyry iceberg at Kainantu and have gained a tremendous amount of knowledge for our porphyry exploration programs going forward. In Papua New Guinea, porphyries tend to cluster and there are five other porphyry targets proximal to Blue Lake, with A1 being of the highest priority. Soil sampling at A1 is expected to commence imminently, with diamond drilling planned afterwards. Between our intrusion related gold/copper exploration at Kora, Judd, Kora South and Judd South and our porphyry exploration, we are very excited about the potential at Kainantu.\u201d\nDeposit Geology\nThe Blue Lake Porphyry Project is located approximately 4 km southwest of the Company\u2019s producing high-grade Kora and Judd intrusion-related gold-copper deposits at the Kainantu Gold Mine. Drilling at Blue Lake has defined a large tonalite porphyry stock, comprising multiple overprinting intrusives, that are variably mineralized with gold and copper. The highest grades are associated with a potassic alteration core, characterized by biotite, K-feldspar and chalcopyrite/bornite mineralization, with a propensity of quartz stockwork veins. Cu/Au mineralization is approximately at a 1:1 ratio, that is open to the south-west.\nThe mineralized porphyry is concentrically zoned and tilted towards the north-west. This zonation is apparent both in metal (sulphide) distribution, with bornite grading into chalcopyrite with a molybdenum periphery, and finally into pyrite, as well as in alteration mineral assemblages, with biotite-K feldspar giving way peripherally to epidote-albite through a transitional actinolite zone. The prograde assemblages have been largely overprinted by intense sericite-pyrite alteration. There is a prominent silica-clay cap, characterized by dominant pyrophyllite, with alunite feeder zones.\nBlue Lake Exploration Background\nThe Blue Lake Porphyry Project was initially recognized in early February 2017, when three small hand specimens were shown by a landowner to K92\u2019s VP Exploration. These comprised intensely altered breccia and dacite, with pyrophyllite altered clasts or leached phenocrysts, respectively, and immediately attracted our attention. When questioned as to their origin, the landowner pointed towards the mountains and said it was from \u2018Blue Lake\u2019.\nThe Blue Lake Porphyry was later discovered in outcrop, during reconnaissance by K92 in May 2017, after which a large (1.5 x 0.8 km) coincident Au-Cu soil geochemical anomaly was defined from soil sampling. The maiden drill hole, KTDD0001, drilled in January 2019, intersected porphyry mineralization, yielding an open-ended 174.6m at 0.64 g/t AuEq (0.28 g/t Au, 0.22 % Cu), from 259.3m. This hole formed part of an initial six-hole program (excluding three short 50m holes and a failed hole at 106m), with hole depths of 400 \u2013 600m depth. The holes were drilled as a fence across the prospect, through the centre of the primary geochemical anomaly, on 200m centres. This program enabled the compilation of an alteration and grade shell model, together with intrusive lithologies and structure, to identify vectors towards mineralization and successfully target the porphyry core.\nA second phase of drilling commenced in November 2020, following an eleven-month hiatus (extended significantly by revised, restricting field protocols associated with COVID-19). During this campaign, a 200-metre spaced grid was drilled over the Blue Lake Porphyry, with some additional deeper, targeted holes drilled. 16 holes were drilled in this phase, for a total of 13,048.30 metres, with multiple long intervals of significant gold-copper mineralization yielded, including 200.16m at 1.00 AuEq (0.51 g/t Au, 0.28 % Cu) from 695.84m in hole KTDD0018.\nK92 engaged independent consulting geologists H&S Consultants Pty Ltd (H&SC) to complete a resource estimate for the Blue Lake gold-copper deposit. The Blue Lake Porphyry Project estimate is based on data and assays from 26 diamond core drill holes at Blue Lake, for a total of 16,474.8 metres.\nThe drillhole assay data comprised 1m sample intervals. For grade interpolation the complete drilling dataset was composited to 2m for gold, copper silver and a gold equivalent and subsequently modelled. The unconstrained 2m compositing produced a total of 8,141 composites. The gold equivalent value was based on K92\u2019s work at the nearby Kora deposit which used the formula:\nAuEq = Au g/t + (Cu% * 1.607) + (Ag ppm * 0.0125)\nThe geological interpretation was supplied by K92 as a series of 3D wireframes created using Leapfrog software, this included lithologies, faulting, alteration and percentage quartz veining. A detailed topographic surface was also supplied. All data was converted to an H&SC N-S orthogonal local grid for ease of working.\nThe interpreted porphyry body and its associated mineralization has overall dimensions of 1500m (X) by 1300m (y) by 1100m (Z) with a modest plunge to grid south-east. Mineralization is close to surface (1950mRL approx.) in the grid west and is open at depth. The Mineral Resource is terminated by a notional-pit outline down to 500m RL. Drillhole spacing was nominally on 100m centres in the centre of the deposit extending to 200m in the periphery.\nGrade interpolation used Ordinary Kriging for a block size of 25m by 25m by 25m with no sub-blocking. The upper (lithocap) and lower (porphyry) mineral zones were treated separately with regards to the variography, but similar search ellipses were employed with a soft boundary between the zones. Each element was modelled separately, although there is some form of zoned correlation between gold and copper for the lower higher grade porphyry zone.\nThe density data was composited to 4m giving 1,879 data points which were subsequently modelled unconstrained using Ordinary Kriging, using similar search parameters and rotations to the global metal grade interpolation. Density showed a marked segregation between the upper lithocap dominated zone and the lower altered tonalite zone.\nAs with most fertile porphyry environments, e.g., Golpu and Oyu Tolgoi, there is likely a cluster of porphyries in the Blue Lake prospect area, with our exploration work to date supporting this, including:\nAdvanced argillic alteration covering a vast area over 5 km in length, from Blue Lake to the A1 target.\nLocally, the roots of the lithocap remain in situ (dominated by pyrophyllite, typically present deep in lithocaps and nearest to porphyry mineralization) at Blue Lake and the Ayena and A1 targets.\nAdvanced Mobile MT (magnetotelluric) geophysics completed in late-2021 has outlined several high conductivity targets coincident with mapped silicification.\nEvidence of a much larger paleo-lithocap, likely formed by copious porphyry activity, is presented in the high proportion of ubiquitous silicified float (boulders) that fills the drainages and colluvium deposits for 20 km all the way to the Markham River.\nBased on the exploration work to date, Blue Lake is proximal to five other porphyry exploration targets: A1, Kokofimpa, Ayena, Timpa and Tankaunan. After the completion of the advanced Mobile MT geophysics in late-2021, A1 is our top porphyry exploration target, driven by having the strongest geophysical conductivity signature, preserved lithocap and situated in a highly prospective environment, at the confluence of the Kora-Kora South, Judd-Judd South structures and the Maniape and Arakompa structures, which both host high-grade intrusion related gold/copper deposits. With the latest program at Blue Lake completed, exploration work on A1 is commencing shortly, including a soil sampling program, detailed mapping and trenching, followed by diamond drilling.\nBlue Lake remains open along strike and down plunge. Additionally, with a higher grade core, it is possible that the mineralization is much more extensive than we currently understand and higher grades may be expected in the deeper parts of the system. Drilling plans to target the definition and expansion of the zone of quartz stockwork veins and bornite mineralization within the potassic core.\nK92 Vice President Exploration, Mr. Chris Muller, PGeo, a Qualified Person under the meaning of National Instrument 43-101 \u2013 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\"), has reviewed and is responsible for the technical content of this news release.

        "full_text": "ST HELIER, Jersey, Aug. 11, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Caledonia Mining Corporation Plc (\u201cCaledonia\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NYSE AMERICAN: CMCL; AIM: CMCL) announces its operating and financial results for the quarter and the six months ended June 30, 2022 (the \u201cQuarter\u201d and \u201cFirst Half\u201d respectively). Further information on the financial and operating results for the Quarter and First Half can be found in the management discussion and analysis (\u201cMD&A\u201d) and the unaudited financial statements which are available on the Company\u2019s website, and which have been filed on SEDAR.\nFinancial Highlights for the Quarter ended June 30, 2022\nGross revenues of $36.99 million, a 23.4 per cent increase on the $29.98 million achieved in the second quarter of 2021 (\"Q2 2021\").\nGross profit of $17.9 million, a 28.8 per cent increase on the $13.9 million in Q2 2021.\nEBITDA (excluding asset impairments, depreciation and net foreign exchange gains) of $17.8 million, a 23.8 per cent increase on the $14.0 million in Q2 2021. This represents EBITDA (excluding asset impairments, depreciation and net foreign exchange gains) for the six months ended June 30, 2022 of $31.5 million (H1 2021: $23.5 million).\nOn-mine cost of $692 per ounce (Q2 2021: $715 per ounce).\nAll-in sustaining cost (\u201cAISC\u201d)1 of $925 per ounce (Q2 2021: $901 per ounce). The 3 per cent increase to the comparable quarter reflects the lower on-mine cost per ounce offset by higher administrative costs.\nBasic IFRS earnings per share (\"EPS\") of 87.7 cents (Q2 2021: 21.1 cents).\nAdjusted EPS of 56.2 cents (Q2 2021: 62.6 cents).\nNet cash from operating activities of $16.7 million (Q2 2021: $12.7 million).\nNet cash and cash equivalents of $10.9 million (Q2 2021, $16.7 million).\nTotal dividend paid in the Quarter of 14 cents per share paid in April 2022; a further dividend at the same rate of 14 cents per share was paid in July 2022.\nOperating Highlights\n20,091 ounces of gold were produced in the Quarter, 20 per cent higher than the 16,710 ounces produced in Q2 2021 and a new production record for any quarter.\n38,605 ounces were produced in the First Half, 29 per cent higher than the 29,907 ounces produced in the first half of 2021.\nOther highlights \u2013 Transaction to acquire the Bilboes gold project\nOn 21 July 2022, Caledonia announced that it had signed an agreement to purchase Bilboes Gold Limited, the parent company which owns, through its Zimbabwe subsidiary, the Bilboes gold project in Zimbabwe (\"Bilboes\" or the \"Project\")2. Subject to satisfaction of the conditions to completion, the total consideration for the acquisition will be 5,123,044 Caledonia shares, representing approximately 28.5 per cent of Caledonia's fully diluted equity, and a 1 per cent net smelter royalty (\"NSR\") on the Project's revenues.\nBilboes hosts NI 43-101 compliant proven and probable mineral reserves of 1.96 million ounces of gold in 26.6 million tonnes at a grade of 2.29 g/t, measured and indicated mineral resources of 2.56 million ounces of gold in 35.2 million tonnes at a grade of 2.26 g/t and inferred mineral resources of 577,000 ounces of gold in 9.5 million tonnes at a grade of 1.89 g/t3.\nThe feasibility study which has been prepared by the vendors indicates the potential for an open-pit gold mine producing an average of 168,000 ounces per year over a 10-year life of mine. Caledonia will prepare a feasibility study to identify the most judicious way to commercialise the Project (with regard to the availability of funding on acceptable terms).\nOutlook\nIncrease production at Blanket Mine (\u201cBlanket\u201d) to the target of 80,000 ounces of gold per annum4, reduce operating costs and increase the flexibility to undertake further development and exploration, thereby safeguarding and enhancing Blanket\u2019s long-term future.\nSatisfy the conditions to enable the completion of the acquisition of Bilboes Gold Limited and, thereafter, prepare a feasibility study to identify the most judicious way to commercialise the Project with regard to the availability of funding on acceptable terms.\nRestart the oxides operation at Bilboes under the terms of a tribute arrangement with a view to creating a cash-generative operation within approximately six months.\nUpgrade the NI 43-101 compliant inferred mineral resources at the Maligreen mining claims which are currently estimated to host approximately 940,000 ounces of gold in 15.6 million tonnes at a grade of 1.88g/t5.\nCommission the 12MWac solar plant, which is expected to provide 27 per cent of Blanket\u2019s total electricity demand.\nContinue to evaluate other investment opportunities in the Zimbabwe gold sector and elsewhere.\nCommenting on the announcement, Mark Learmonth, Chief Executive Officer, said:\n\u201cThis has been a terrific quarter and, indeed, half year with second quarter production of just over 20,000 ounces which set a record for any quarter. The first half of 2022 exceeded our expectations and we have now achieved our quarterly production target. Excellent production, along with a higher gold price and good cost control, has contributed to a 321% increase in IFRS earnings per share and a 31% increase in net cash from operating activities over the comparable quarter in 2021.\n\u201cIn July, Caledonia announced that it had signed an agreement to purchase Bilboes Gold Limited, which is the holding company for a large, high-grade, open-pittable gold resource. We have followed the progress of the project for several years and believe that Bilboes is the premier gold development project in Zimbabwe, and indeed one of the best gold development projects in Africa.\n\u201cThe completion of the transaction is subject to several conditions, but once achieved we can prepare a feasibility study to identify the most judicious way to commercialise the project with regard to the availability of funding on acceptable terms. Caledonia also intends to re-start the oxides operation at Bilboes under a tribute arrangement before completion of the transaction with a view to creating a cash-generative operation within approximately six months.\n\u201cOur immediate strategic focus continues to be on Blanket and we are on track to meet our target production of between 73-80,000 ounces of gold for this year, with first half production of 38,605 ounces of gold. We will also continue to reduce our operating costs and increase the flexibility to undertake further development and exploration, thereby safeguarding and enhancing Blanket\u2019s long-term future.\n\u201cThe proposed acquisition of Bilboes also builds on the recent acquisition of the Maligreen claims, where we continue to evaluate the existing geological information and are focused on increasing the confidence of the resource base. Caledonia will also consider other investment opportunities in the Zimbabwe gold sector within the constraints of its financing and management capacity.\n\u201c2022 has been an outstanding year so far and I would like to thank the team for their continued hard work.\u201d\nCaledonia will host an online presentation and Q&A session open to all investors on 12 August 2022 at 14:00 London Time\nLiberum Capital Limited (Joint Broker) Scott Mathieson/Kane Collings\nTel: +44 20 3100 2000\nBlytheRay Financial PR (UK) Tim Blythe/Megan Ray\nTel: +44 207 138 3204\n3PPB (Financial PR, North America) Patrick Chidley Paul Durham\nTel: +1 917 991 7701 Tel: +1 203 940 2538\nCurate Public Relations (Zimbabwe) Debra Tatenda\nTel: +263 77802131\nIH Securities (Private) Limited (VFEX Sponsor - Zimbabwe) Lloyd Mlotshwa\nTel: +263 (242) 745 119/33/39\nNote: This announcement contains inside information which is disclosed in accordance with the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014(\u201cMAR\u201d)as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and is disclosed in accordance with the Company's obligations under Article 17 of MAR.\nCautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Information Information and statements contained in this news release that are not historical facts are \u201cforward-looking information\u201d within the meaning of applicable securities legislation that involve risks and uncertainties relating, but not limited, to Caledonia\u2019s current expectations, intentions, plans, and beliefs.

(\"Sandstorm Gold Royalties\", \"Sandstorm\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: SAND) (TSX: SSL) has released its results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2022 (all figures in U.S. dollars).\nSECOND QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS\nRecord attributable gold equivalent ounces1 of 19,276 ounces (Q2 2021\u201418,004 ounces);\nRecord revenue of $36.0 million (Q2 2021\u2014$26.4 million);\nCash flows from operating activities, excluding changes in non-cash working capital1 of $21.9 million (Q2 2021\u2014$17.6 million);\nAverage cash cost per attributable gold equivalent ounce1 of $273 resulting in cash operating margins1 of $1,593 per ounce (Q2 2021\u2014$227 per ounce and $1,569 per ounce respectively);\nRecord net income of $39.7 million (Q2 2021\u2014$8.6 million); and\nTransformative transactions:\nUnlocking value through creation of Sandbox Royalties: In June 2022, the Company closed its previously announced sale of a portfolio of royalties to Sandbox Royalties Corp. (\"Sandbox\") for $65 million comprising common shares of Sandbox, cash, and a convertible promissory note. With the creation of Sandbox, a diversified royalty company, Sandstorm expects to surface value of certain royalties that it believes are not receiving their warranted value within Sandstorm's existing portfolio.\nOUTLOOK\nBased on the Company's existing royalties and contingent on the completion of the Nomad Acquisition, attributable gold equivalent ounces for 2022 is forecast to be between 80,000 and 85,000 ounces. Subject to the conversion of the Hod Maden interest into a gold stream and the closing of the Nomad Acquisition, the Company is forecasting attributable gold equivalent production to be 155,000 ounces in 2025.\nFINANCIAL RESULTS\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2022, the Company realized record revenue of $36.0 million compared with $26.4 million for the comparable period in 2021. The increase is attributable to a 7% increase in attributable gold equivalent ounces sold as well as a 4% increase in the average realized selling price of gold. In particular, the increase in revenue was driven by an increase in revenue attributable to the Mercedes mine which commenced making deliveries in April 2022, and an increase in revenue attributable to the Chapada copper stream due to an increase in the average realized selling price of copper and an increase in the number of copper pounds sold. Additionally, there was an increase in revenue attributable to the Vale Royalties, which were purchased in June 2021, and an increase in revenue attributable to the Vatukoula God Stream, which commenced making deliveries in December 2021.\nNet income was higher during the second quarter of 2022 when compared to the same period in 2021. The increase is attributable to the increase in revenue (as described above) as well as a $22.9 million gain on the disposal of a portfolio of royalties to Sandbox for consideration of common shares of Sandbox, cash, and a convertible promissory note. Additionally, the increase in net income was attributable to a $12.5 million gain resulting from the sale of the Company's equity interest in Entr\u00e9e Resources to Horizon Copper. The year-over-year increase in net income was partially offset by an increase in depletion largely due to an increase in attributable gold ounces sold, a decrease in the gains recognized on the revaluation of the Company's investments, and certain items that were recognized during the three months ended June 30, 2021 that did not occur during the three months ended June 30, 2022, including the recognition of a $5.9 million gain on the revaluation of the Company's financial instrument related to the Vale Royalties which was both entered into and disposed of during the three months ended June 30, 2021.\nSTREAMS & ROYALTIES\nOf the gold equivalent ounces sold by Sandstorm during the second quarter of 2022, approximately 16% were attributable to mines located in Canada, 23% from the rest of North America, 49% from South America, and 12% from other countries.\nRevenue | Gold Equivalent | |\nCanada | $5.8 | 3,109 |\nNorth America excl. Canada | $8.1 | 4,361 |\nSouth America | $17.6 | 9,410 |\nOther | $4.5 | 2,395 |\nTotal | $36.0 | 19,276 |\nCanada\nStreams and royalties on Canadian mines contributed 31% more gold equivalent ounces to Sandstorm when compared to the second quarter of 2021. The change is primarily due to an increase in royalty revenue from the Diavik mine in the Northwest Territories, driven by diamond price increases and the timing of sales, and an increase in ounces received from the Black Fox mine. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in royalty revenues from the Bracemac-McLeod mine in Qu\u00e9bec, which is in the process of winding down operations.\nNorth America Excluding Canada\nThe gold equivalent ounces sold from operations located within North America, but outside of Canada, contributed 32% more gold equivalent ounces when compared to the second quarter of 2021. The change was primarily driven by an increase in the ounces received from the Mercedes mine, which commenced making deliveries to Sandstorm in April 2022. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in ounces received from the Santa Elena mine, partly due to mining activity on concessions not subject to the gold stream.\nSouth America\nOperations in South America contributed 15% less gold equivalent ounces sold when compared to the second quarter of 2021. The decrease was driven, in part, by a decrease in royalty revenue received from the Aurizona mine in Brazil. As well, in the second quarter 2021, the Company recognized a gain on the revaluation of the financial instrument related to the Vale Royalties purchased in June 2021, resulting in higher attributable gold equivalent ounces for the comparative period in 2021. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in gold equivalent ounces sold from the Chapada mine in Brazil, and an increase in royalty revenue from the Fruta del Norte mine.\nOther\nStreams and royalties on mines in other countries contributed 87% more gold equivalent ounces sold when compared to the second quarter of 2021. This change is primarily due to an increase in ounces sold from the Vatukoula mine in Fiji, which commenced making deliveries to Sandstorm in December 2021, and an increase in royalty revenue from the Hound\u00e9 mine in Burkina Faso. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in gold equivalent ounces sold from the Karma mine in Burkina Faso.\nWEBCAST & CONFERENCE CALL DETAILS\nA conference call will be held on Friday, August 12, 2022 starting at 8:30am PDT to further discuss the second quarter results.

Total sales, royalties and income from other interests is a non-IFRS financial measure and is calculated by taking total revenue which includes sales and royalty revenue, and adding contractual income relating to royalties, streams and other interests excluding gains and losses on dispositions. The Company presents total sales, royalties, and income from other interests as it believes that certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance in comparison to other streaming and royalty companies in the precious metals mining industry. Attributable gold equivalent ounce is a non-IFRS financial ratio that uses total sales, royalties, and income from other interests as a component. Attributable gold equivalent ounce is calculated by dividing the Company's total sales, royalties, and income from other interests for the period by the average realized gold price per ounce from the Company's gold streams for the same respective period. The Company presents attributable gold equivalent ounce as it believes that certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance in comparison to other streaming and royalty companies in the precious metals mining industry that present results on a similar basis. Average cash cost per attributable gold equivalent ounce is calculated by dividing the Company's cost of sales, excluding depletion by the number of attributable gold equivalent ounces. The Company presents average cash cost per attributable gold equivalent ounce as it believes that certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance in comparison to other streaming and royalty companies in the precious metals mining industry who present results on a similar basis. Cash operating margin is calculated by subtracting the average cash cost per attributable gold equivalent ounce from the average realized gold price per ounce from the Company's gold streams. The Company presents cash operating margin as it believes that certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance in comparison to other companies in the precious metals mining industry who present results on a similar basis. The Company has also used the non-IFRS financial measure of cash flows from operating activities excluding changes in non-cash working capital. This measure is calculated by adding back the decrease or subtracting the increase in changes in non-cash working capital to or from cash provided by (used in) operating activities. The Company presents cash flows from operating activities excluding changes in non-cash working capital as it believes that certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance in comparison to other streaming and royalty companies in the precious metals mining industry that present results on a similar basis. Refer to pages 36\u201339 of the Company's MD&A for the period ended June 30, 2022, which is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com, for a numerical reconciliation of the non-IFRS financial measures described above. The presentation of these non-IFRS financial measures is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Other companies may calculate these non-IFRS financial measures differently. |\nFor more information about Sandstorm Gold Royalties, please visit our website at www.sandstormgold.com or email us at info@sandstormgold.com.\nABOUT SANDSTORM GOLD ROYALTIES\nSandstorm is a gold royalty company that provides upfront financing to gold mining companies that are looking for capital and in return, receives the right to a percentage of the gold produced from a mine, for the life of the mine. After the closing of the Nomad Acquisition announced on May 2, 2022, Sandstorm will hold a portfolio of 250 royalties, of which 39 of the underlying mines are producing. Sandstorm plans to grow and diversify its low cost production profile through the acquisition of additional gold royalties.

In particular, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the terms \"mineral reserve\", \"proven mineral reserve\", \"probable mineral reserve\", \"inferred mineral resources,\", \"indicated mineral resources,\" \"measured mineral resources\" and \"mineral resources\" used or referenced herein and the documents incorporated by reference herein, as applicable, are Canadian mineral disclosure terms as defined in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 \u2014 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\") and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the \"CIM\") \u2014 CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council, as amended (the \"CIM Definition Standards\").\nFor United States reporting purposes, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") has adopted amendments to its disclosure rules (the \"SEC Modernization Rules\") to modernize the mining property disclosure requirements for issuers whose securities are registered with the SEC under the Exchange Act, which became effective February 25, 2019. The SEC Modernization Rules more closely align the SEC's disclosure requirements and policies for mining properties with current industry and global regulatory practices and standards, including NI 43-101, and replace the historical property disclosure requirements for mining registrants that were included in SEC Industry Guide 7. Issuers were required to comply with the SEC Modernization Rules in their first fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2021. As a foreign private issuer that is eligible to file reports with the SEC pursuant to the multi-jurisdictional disclosure system, the Corporation is not required to provide disclosure on its mineral properties under the SEC Modernization Rules and will continue to provide disclosure under NI 43-101 and the CIM Definition Standards. Accordingly, mineral reserve and mineral resource information contained or incorporated by reference herein may not be comparable to similar information disclosed by United States companies subject to the United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nAs a result of the adoption of the SEC Modernization Rules, the SEC now recognizes estimates of \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources.\" In addition, the SEC has amended its definitions of \"proven mineral reserves\" and \"probable mineral reserves\" to be \"substantially similar\" to the corresponding CIM Definition Standards that are required under NI 43-101. While the SEC will now recognize \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources\", U.S. investors should not assume that all or any part of the mineralization in these categories will be converted into a higher category of mineral resources or into mineral reserves without further work and analysis. Mineralization described using these terms has a greater amount of uncertainty as to its existence and feasibility than mineralization that has been characterized as reserves. Accordingly, U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources, or inferred mineral resources that the Company reports are or will be economically or legally mineable without further work and analysis. Further, \"inferred mineral resources\" have a greater amount of uncertainty and as to whether they can be mined legally or economically. Therefore, U.S. investors are also cautioned not to assume that all or any part of inferred mineral resources will be upgraded to a higher category without further work and analysis. Under Canadian securities laws, estimates of \"inferred mineral resources\" may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases. While the above terms are \"substantially similar\" to CIM Definitions, there are differences in the definitions under the SEC Modernization Rules and the CIM Definition Standards. Accordingly, there is no assurance any mineral reserves or mineral resources that the Company may report as \"proven mineral reserves\", \"probable mineral reserves\", \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources\" under NI 43-101 would be the same had the Company prepared the reserve or resource estimates under the standards adopted under the SEC Modernization Rules or under the prior standards of SEC Industry Guide 7.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\", within the meaning of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation, concerning the business, operations and financial performance and condition of Sandstorm Gold Royalties.

Coeur spent $4 million on exploration at the mine in 2021, its largest since acquiring the asset in 2015.\nMetalla holds a 1.0% GVR royalty on the Wharf mine.\nNew Luika Silver Stream\nOn July 21, 2022, Shanta Gold Limited (\"Shanta\") reported that it produced 17.5 Koz of gold at its NLGM in Tanzania in the second quarter of 2022, in line with full year production guidance of 68-76 Koz gold. On July 19, 2021, Shanta announced a new mine plan for NLGM, where average annual production is expected to be 73.6 Koz gold with the potential to extend mine life beyond 2026 through conversion of significant known resources and the expanded 2,450 tpd mill throughput. Shanta expects total gold production from NLGM for the five-year plan to total 368 Koz from both open pit and underground mine sources from the mining license.\nMetalla holds a 15% interest in Silverback, whose sole business is receipt and distribution of a 100% silver stream on NLGM at an ongoing cost of 10% of the spot silver price.\nC\u00f4t\u00e9-Gosselin\nOn August 3, 2022, IAMGOLD Corporation (\"IAMGOLD\") reported that construction had reached 57% completion at the C\u00f4t\u00e9 Gold Project. It also reported completion in the second quarter of 2022 of approximately 10,500 meters of the 16,000 meter drill program is planned in 2022 to further delineate and expand the Gosselin mineral resources and test selected targets along the deposit corridor. In addition, IAMGOLD completed a project update to the C\u00f4t\u00e9 life-of-mine plans where the update proposes an 18-year mine life with initial production expected in early 2024. Average annual production during the first six years is expected to be 495 Koz gold and 365 Koz over the life-of-mine.\nMetalla holds a 1.35% NSR royalty that covers less than 10% of the C\u00f4t\u00e9 reserves and resources estimate and covers all of the Gosselin resource estimate.\nCastle Mountain\nCastle Mountain is slated to become one of Equinox Gold's (\"Equinox\") largest assets. Metalla's 5.0% NSR royalty covers the South Domes portion of the deposit which will be part of the Phase 2 expansion slated to begin in 2026.\nOn August 3, 2022, Equinox reported production in the second quarter of 6.7 Koz gold and exploration expenditure in the second quarter of $0.5 million at the Castle Mountain property. This was in addition to the exploration announced on May 3, 2022, where drilling in the first quarter included 7,948 meters of RC drilling across the South dump area to assess the continuity and distribution of grade. Equinox also completed 1,448 meters of RC drilling in the area between the JSLA and South Domes pits.\nEquinox also announced that in March 2022 it had submitted applications to amend existing permits to accommodate the Phase 2 expansion. On February 24, 2022, Equinox announced they expect to spend $7 million for Phase 2 permitting, optimization studies and metallurgical test work and nearly $2 million for exploration. As of August 3, 2022, the Phase 2 permitting timeline was on schedule with the San Bernardino County having determined the application was complete. Equinox expects the U.S. Bureau of Land management to complete its completeness review by the end of July with the application reviews to run through to the end of 2022. Both agencies will determine the appropriate level of state and federal environmental review required with the resulting review process anticipated to begin by early 2023.\nMetalla holds a 5.0% NSR royalty on the South Domes area of the Castle Mountain mine.\nGarrison\nOn July 7, 2022, Moneta released the results of exploration drilling at the Garrison deposit in their Tower Gold project. Drilling results tested new areas all within the Tower Gold project, including east and west of the Garrcon resource, south of the Westaway resource at South Basin, east of the Windjammer South resource at Halfway, and west of the 55 deposit. Drilling has confirmed significant gold mineralization beyond the current resource. Highlights include a drill hole that intercepted significant mineralization with 50.09 g/t gold over 5.05 meters and 0.66 g/t gold over 16 meters. The holes highlight the potential to expand the Garrcon resource pit shells and open new targets for future exploration drilling.\nOn May 11, 2022, Moneta released an updated resource estimate for the Tower Gold project, including 4.27 Moz gold in the Indicated category and 7.5 Moz gold in the Inferred category. Moneta plans to complete a Preliminary Economic Assessment on the project scheduled for completion later in the second quarter of 2022. The Garrison deposit forms part of the Tower project and is comprised of three zones, Garrcon, Jonpol, and 903. At Garrcon, the open pit Indicated Resource is 841 Koz at 1.02 g/t gold with an Inferred Resource of 15Koz at 0.67 g/t gold, the underground portion has an Indicated Resource of 87 Koz at 5.08 g/t gold with an Inferred Resource of 120 Koz at 4.98 g/t gold. The Jonpol zone has an Indicated Resource of 297 Koz at 1.4 g/t gold and an Inferred Resource of 114 Koz at 0.99 g/t gold. The 903 zone has an Indicated Resource of 610 Koz at 1.01 g/t gold and an Inferred Resource of 600 Koz at 0.74 g/t gold. The Garrison starter pit now has an Indicated Resource of 1.75 Moz at 1.07 g/t gold. Moneta is slated to release a PEA in the second half of 2022.\nMetalla holds a 2.0% NSR royalty on the Garrison project.\nWasamac\nOn July 7, 2022, Yamana announced the approval of the Wasamac bulk sample program, providing for earlier access to the deposit and to increase the level of confidence in the future mining of the project. Permit approvals are expected in early 2023 with ramp development potentially beginning in Spring 2023. A reassessment of the Wasamac project highlighted an improved gold production profile compared to the feasibility study with new projections of ramp-up to 200 Koz in 2027 and up to 250 Koz in 2028. Ongoing mine design and sequence optimizations could position Wasamac with the option for future incremental expansion of the mill to 9,000 tpd from 7,000 tpd in year 3 of operations which will extend the gold production profile of 250 Koz per year until at least 2030. Yamana also highlighted additional opportunities not included in the strategic plan which include processing flow sheet optimization to increase metallurgical recoveries by approximately 3%, optimized configuration of the tailings filter plant and paste backfill plant. Yamana also announced that bulk sample permits are scheduled for submission in the third quarter of 2022, with the approval expected in early 2023 and ramp development could begin in spring 2023.\nOn July 27, 2022, Yamana announced positive results from infill drilling at the Wasamac project where grades continue to exceed expectations with significant results include 5.05 g/t gold over 54.06 meters and 5.45 g/t gold over 16.8 meters. Exploration drilling at the Wildcat South target continued to expand on the discovery with a significant intercept of 7.31 g/t gold over 3.37 meters and 1.46 g/t gold over 12.3 meters.\nMetalla holds a 1.5% NSR royalty on the Wasamac project subject to a buy back of 0.5% for C$7.5 million.\nAmalgamated Kirkland Property\nOn July 27, 2022, Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (\"Agnico\") reported that an assessment was ongoing at the Amalgamated Kirkland deposit to provide incremental ore feed to the Macassa mill with annual production of 40 Koz as soon as 2024. The Macassa underground ramp had been extended by 615 meters and twenty-four drill holes had been completed in the higher-grade portion of the deposit. Significant intercepts from the underground drill program include 14.1 g/t gold over 6.5 meters, 23.9 g/t gold over 2.0 meters and 14.9 g/t gold over 3.0 meters. Drilling from the surface drill program designed to infill near surface mineralization proves to be successful in confirming grade thicknesses with significant intercepts of 6.9 g/t gold over 6.7 meters, 5.9 g/t gold over 6 meters and 9 g/t gold over 9.2 meters.\nIn 2022, Agnico plans to spend $8.6 million on a 1.3 kilometre exploration ramp from the Macassa near surface zones, designed to carry out infill drilling and a bulk sample of the higher-grade regions of the Amalgamated Kirkland deposit. On April 28, 2022, Agnico reported that the Amalgamated Kirkland deposit hosts an Indicated Resource estimate of 265 Koz gold at 6.51 g/t gold and an Inferred Resource of 406 Koz at 5.32 g/t gold.

        "full_text": "COEUR D'ALENE, ID / ACCESSWIRE / August 15, 2022 / Idaho Strategic Resources, Inc. (NYSE American:IDR) (\"IDR\", \"Idaho Strategic\" or the \"Company\") today announced its consolidated operating and financial results for the second quarter of 2022. Including an increase in revenue, the Company's addition of the Lemhi Pass Project, increased exploration at the Company's rare earth element projects, and the acquisition of a secondary headquarters located in Salmon, Idaho.\nIdaho Strategic's President and CEO, John Swallow commented, \"The world has changed/is changing and we are cognizant that generational opportunities such as this are rarely seen in a person's investing (or company-building) lifetime. While we are still in the beginning phases of our 'growth and development post base-building' plan, we are also patient with our approach and diligently work to keep ourselves in the position to control our own destiny, especially with how fast things are moving. IDR has gotten to this point without the outsized influence of institutions or other groups while investing and providing decent returns over time - and sometimes I think folks need a gentle reminder of this.\nFrom a macro perspective (or as some in the company might say, 'the world according to John'), I continue to believe that our business (and investment) is built for these times. The global uncertainty created by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict and China's continued execution of their belt-and-road initiative lends itself to support domestic miners. Especially those with exposure to technology metals and energy metals for which we are greatly reliant on foreign sources.\nAt both the corporate and operational level, we have identified our preferred path forward and have also (finally) begun working on the 'post district consolidation' potential to expand production within the Murray Gold Belt (near the Golden Chest Mine), which we believe will further demonstrate the economic value of a centrally located mill in the MGB. A short time ago we began a drill program on some of our land near the Golden Chest - the first ever drilling on this land package - and expect to have some preliminary results out soon. To be conducting the first drilling in the MGB that we know of in the last 120 years\u2026 this is something that has our entire company extremely excited. We are conducting this phase of exploration drilling in the MGB while simultaneously investing time and resources into advancing the Klondike underground, our critical mineral, rare earth elements and thorium projects and navigating the new world of political and corporate types looking toward the era of decarbonization, EVs, etc. Our drill program at Diamond Creek was delayed due to the Moose Fire in the Salmon area, however the drill remained nearby, and we expect to have the \u2018all-clear' to resume with that program shortly. To say that we are eager to get that drill turning is putting it mildly.\nLooking back on the past six months of operations, perhaps the most noticeable investment we have made has been in our people. Our co-workers are our best promoters, and they know \u2018the rule'. We continue to recruit and retain some of the best miners, millers, drillers, and geologists in the area who are domain experts in their respective fields. Investing in human capital is something that doesn't have a defined payback period, but it is something that we believe lays the foundation of a multigenerational business which can lead to multigenerational returns within our community.\"\nOperational Highlights include the following:\nRare Earth Elements/Thorium\nIn May the Company announced Idaho Strategic Resources Adds the Lemhi Pass Project - The Largest Known Concentration of Thorium Resources in the United States. The Lemhi Pass District is \"listed as the largest concentration of Thorium resources in the United States\", per the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the Idaho Geological Survey (IGS). The addition of this land package not only compliments IDR's nationally ranked \u2018Technology Metals' Rare Earth Elements (REE) holdings; by adding this Thorium land package to its portfolio, the Company's entrance into the 'Energy Metals' sector has been realized and a major U.S. Thorium/REE area is secured.\nAlso in May, the Company announced Idaho Strategic Resources Announces Addition of the Lemhi Pass Rare Earth Element Project in Central Idaho. This land package consists of 25 unpatented claims, covering an area of approximately 425 acres in the northeastern part of the Lemhi Pass District. The northeastern portion of Lemhi Pass contains the greatest concentration of veins where the large Lemhi Pass, Bull Moose, and Dan Patch faults either intersect or approach one another.\nIn June the Company received final approval for its Diamond Creek drill program and announced the purchase of a company office building in Salmon, Idaho.\nGolden Chest/Murray Gold Belt\nAt the Golden Chest, ore mined from underground stopes totaled approximately 8,540 tonnes from the 815, 830, and 833 stopes. Development waste tonnage totaled 1,070 tonnes as the Main Access Ramp (MAR) was extended at depth. Additionally, 4,021 cubic meters of backfill was placed during the quarter which was a 40% increase over the first quarter as the mining crews increased the efficiency of the backfill cycle.\nOpen pit mining was completed in the Klondike pit and another small pit was started on a high-grade hangingwall vein exposure called the Jumbo vein. Average daily mining production on the surface was 816 tonnes per day with about 3,100 tonnes of ore mined during the quarter.\nFor the quarter ended June 30, 2022, a total of 11,624 dry metric tonnes (dmt) were processed at the Company's New Jersey mill with a flotation feed head grade of 4.58 grams per tone (gpt) with gold recovery of 90.1%\nThe Company drilled 1,700 meters during the quarter in nine holes spread out amongst the Skookum, Golden Chest, and Paymaster Shoots at the Golden Chest mine. Assay results are pending. At the end of the quarter the Company drill rig was moved to the Argus exploration property to drill the first holes ever drilled on the Company's Murray Gold Belt properties.\nIn early June, the Company began an exploration crosscut on the 941 Level in the northern end of the Golden Chest mine in an area known as the Klondike. The target of the crosscut the target is one of the vein intercepts in GC 21-207 (11.8 g/t gold over 1.9 meters) previously reported (Idaho Strategic Resources Continues to Drill Gold-Quartz Veins at Klondike and Paymaster December 13, 2021). The crosscut hit the vein in early August and drifting on the vein will commence to determine the grade and continuity of the new vein.\nCorporate Highlights include the following:\nOur financial performance during the quarter is summarized below:\nRevenue was $2,358,492 and $4,402,909, respectively for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2022, compared to $2,180,232 and $3,766,859 for the comparable periods of 2021. The increase was mostly the result of increased production.\nThe Company had a gross profit of $7,457 and $313,599 in the three- and six-month periods ending June 30, 2022, compared to a gross profit of $362,249 and $290,845 for the comparative periods in 2021. Gross profit decreased in the second quarter of 2022 because of lower gold prices, increased costs of consumables, and a gold inventory adjustment.\nCash costs per ounce and AISC increased for the three-month period but decreased for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2022.The Company increased underground production of higher-grade ore and experienced lower gold prices in the second quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. The AISC per ounce six month decrease in cost was also a result of utilizing the Company's in house core drilling only in 2022. In 2021 the Company used both in-house drilling and a contract driller for drilling in the Paymaster/Joe Dandy.\nAn operating loss of $846,721 and $1,272,887 for the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2022, compared to an operating loss of $80,689 and $1,707,346 in the comparable periods of 2021. Some of the changes were a result of increased exploration, costs associated with the Company's NYSE original listing application, a portion of the annual listing fee and legal expenses, fees associated with the Company's S-3 Registration Statement filed with the SEC, contract core drilling in the Paymaster/Joe Dandy, and expense for stock options granted in the first quarter of 2021.\nNet loss of $852,249 and $1,352,318 for the three and six-periods ended June 30, 2022, compared to net loss of $140,768 and $1,803,172 in the comparable periods ended June 30, 2021. The reasons for these changes are the same as those for the operating loss described above.\nExploration costs increased for the three-month period and decreased for the six-month period ending June 30, 2022, compared to 2021 because of increased drilling by the in-house drill, an increase in exploration on the Rare Earth properties in the second quarter of 2022, and the use of contract core drilling for the Paymaster/Joe Dandy in the first quarter of 2021.\nReasons for changes in management, professional services, and general and administrative expenses between the comparable periods in 2022 and 2021 include costs associated with the Company's NYSE original listing application fee and SEC filings as mentioned above in the second quarter of 2022 and options being granted to management, directors, and employees for a total cost of $604,571 in the first quarter of 2021.\nThe consolidated net loss for the six-months ended June 30, 2022, and 2021 included non-cash charges as follows: depreciation and amortization of $472,115 ($378,173 in 2021), loss on disposal of equipment of $3,901 (none in 2021), accretion of asset retirement obligation of $5,069 ($5,035 in 2021), stock-based compensation of none in 2022 ($614,431 in 2021), the issuance of common stock for services $32,326 ($6,500 in 2021), gain on forgiveness of SBA loan of $10,000 (none in 2021), and equity income on investment in Buckskin $671 in 2022 (None in 2021).\nQuality assurance/quality control\nAll of the samples were analyzed by American Analytical of Osburn, Idaho, an ISO certified laboratory. Samples were analyzed using lead collection fire assay with a gravimetric finish. A series of known assay standards are submitted with each drill hole as part of a quality assurance-quality compliance program.\nQualified person\nIDR's Vice President, Grant A.

With over 7,000 acres of patented and unpatented land, the Company has the largest private land position in the area following its consolidation of the Murray Gold Belt for the first time in over 100-years.\nIn addition to gold and gold production, the Company maintains an important strategic presence in the U.S. Critical Minerals sector, specifically focused on the more \"at-risk\" Rare Earth Elements (REE's) and Thorium. The Company's Diamond Creek and Roberts REE properties are included the U.S. national REE inventory as listed in USGS, IGS and DOE publications. IDR's Lemhi Pass Thorium-REE Project is recognized by the USGS and IGS as containing the largest concentration of thorium resources in the country. All three projects are located in central Idaho and participating in the USGS Earth MRI program.\nWith an impressive mix of experience and dedication, the folks at IDR maintain a long-standing \"We Live Here\" approach to corporate culture, land management, and historic preservation. Furthermore, it is our belief that successful operations begin with the heightened responsibility that only local oversight and a community mindset can provide. Its \"everyone goes home at night\" policy would not be possible without the multi-generational base of local exploration, drilling, mining, milling, and business professionals that reside in and near the communities of the Silver Valley and North Idaho\nFor more information on Idaho Strategic Resources click here for our corporate presentation, go to www.idahostrategic.com or call:\nTravis Swallow, Investor Relations & Corporate Development\nThis release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended that are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by such sections.

In particular, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the terms \"mineral reserve\", \"proven mineral reserve\", \"probable mineral reserve\", \"inferred mineral resources,\", \"indicated mineral resources,\" \"measured mineral resources\" and \"mineral resources\" used or referenced herein and the documents incorporated by reference herein, as applicable, are Canadian mineral disclosure terms as defined in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 \u2014 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\") and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the \"CIM\") \u2014 CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council, as amended (the \"CIM Definition Standards\").\nFor United States reporting purposes, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") has adopted amendments to its disclosure rules (the \"SEC Modernization Rules\") to modernize the mining property disclosure requirements for issuers whose securities are registered with the SEC under the Exchange Act, which became effective February 25, 2019. The SEC Modernization Rules more closely align the SEC's disclosure requirements and policies for mining properties with current industry and global regulatory practices and standards, including NI 43-101, and replace the historical property disclosure requirements for mining registrants that were included in SEC Industry Guide 7. Issuers were required to comply with the SEC Modernization Rules in their first fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2021. As a foreign private issuer that is eligible to file reports with the SEC pursuant to the multi-jurisdictional disclosure system, the Corporation is not required to provide disclosure on its mineral properties under the SEC Modernization Rules and will continue to provide disclosure under NI 43-101 and the CIM Definition Standards. Accordingly, mineral reserve and mineral resource information contained or incorporated by reference herein may not be comparable to similar information disclosed by United States companies subject to the United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nAs a result of the adoption of the SEC Modernization Rules, the SEC now recognizes estimates of \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources.\" In addition, the SEC has amended its definitions of \"proven mineral reserves\" and \"probable mineral reserves\" to be \"substantially similar\" to the corresponding CIM Definition Standards that are required under NI 43-101. While the SEC will now recognize \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources\", U.S. investors should not assume that all or any part of the mineralization in these categories will be converted into a higher category of mineral resources or into mineral reserves without further work and analysis. Mineralization described using these terms has a greater amount of uncertainty as to its existence and feasibility than mineralization that has been characterized as reserves. Accordingly, U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources, or inferred mineral resources that the Company reports are or will be economically or legally mineable without further work and analysis. Further, \"inferred mineral resources\" have a greater amount of uncertainty and as to whether they can be mined legally or economically. Therefore, U.S. investors are also cautioned not to assume that all or any part of inferred mineral resources will be upgraded to a higher category without further work and analysis. Under Canadian securities laws, estimates of \"inferred mineral resources\" may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases. While the above terms are \"substantially similar\" to CIM Definitions, there are differences in the definitions under the SEC Modernization Rules and the CIM Definition Standards. Accordingly, there is no assurance any mineral reserves or mineral resources that the Company may report as \"proven mineral reserves\", \"probable mineral reserves\", \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources\" under NI 43-101 would be the same had the Company prepared the reserve or resource estimates under the standards adopted under the SEC Modernization Rules or under the prior standards of SEC Industry Guide 7.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\", within the meaning of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation, concerning the business, operations and financial performance and condition of Sandstorm Gold Royalties.

Forward-looking statements can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \"may\", \"will\", \"expect\", \"intend\", \"estimate\", \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"continue\", \"plans\", or similar terminology.\nForward-looking statements are made based upon certain assumptions and other important factors that, if untrue, could cause the actual results, performances or achievements of Sandstorm Gold Royalties to be materially different from future results, performances or achievements expressed or implied by such statements. Such statements and information are based on numerous assumptions regarding present and future business strategies and the environment in which Sandstorm Gold Royalties will operate in the future, including the receipt of all required approvals, the price of gold and copper and anticipated costs. Certain important factors that could cause actual results, performances or achievements to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, amongst others, failure to receive necessary approvals, changes in business plans and strategies, market conditions, share price, best use of available cash, gold and other commodity price volatility, discrepancies between actual and estimated production, mineral reserves and resources and metallurgical recoveries, mining operational and development risks relating to the parties which produce the gold or other commodity the Company will purchase, regulatory restrictions, activities by governmental authorities (including changes in taxation), currency fluctuations, the global economic climate, dilution, share price volatility and competition.\nForward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause the actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, including but not limited to: the impact of general business and economic conditions, the absence of control over mining operations from which the Company will purchase gold, other commodities or receive royalties from, and risks related to those mining operations, including risks related to international operations, government and environmental regulation, actual results of current exploration activities, conclusions of economic evaluations and changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined, risks in the marketability of minerals, fluctuations in the price of gold and other commodities, fluctuation in foreign exchange rates and interest rates, stock market volatility, as well as those factors discussed in the section entitled \"Risks to Sandstorm\" in the Company's annual report for the financial year ended December 31, 2021 and the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" contained in the Company's annual information form dated March 31, 2022 available at www.sedar.com. Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that are contained or incorporated by reference, except in accordance with applicable securities laws.\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sandstorm-gold-royalties-completes-acquisition-of-nomad-royalty-company-301605621.html\nSOURCE Sandstorm Gold Ltd.\nView original content to download multimedia: http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/August2022/15/c5368.html",

This is supported by closer-spaced diamond drilling within the upper portion of the main La India pit, along with additional detailed deposit-scale surface mapping.\nMark Child, Chairman and CEO commented:\n\u201cCondor has produced a much more robust and conversative Mineral Resource Estimate for the entire La India Project, which comprises 6 separate deposits all of which have potential to be expanded. The focus has been of strengthening the confidence of the geological model ahead of a forthcoming Feasibility Study on La India Open Pit. The update on La India Open Pit includes assay results from infill drilling, a new lithological, structural and weathering model, a new depletion model for historic and artisanal mining and an increase in the cut-off grade to 0.65 g/t gold from 0.50 g/t gold. The updated Mineral Resource includes the latest operating costs and bulk density measurements. I am pleased the drilling on the Cacao deposit increased the Mineral Resource Estimate in the inferred mineral resource category by 69% to 101,000 oz gold at 2.5 g/t gold, the interpretation is that drilling has clipped the top of a fully preserved epithermal vein system with a strike length of at least 1km.\nThe updated Mineral Resource Estimate is 9,672 kt at 3.5g/t gold for 1,088,000 oz gold in the indicated mineral resource category and 8,642 kt at 4.3g/t gold for 1,190,000 oz gold in the inferred mineral resource category. A Feasibility Study is being conducted on La India Open Pit which has a Mineral Resource Estimate of 8,487 kt at 3.0g/t gold in for 827,000 oz gold in the indicated mineral resource category and 893 Kt at 2.4 g/t gold for 69,000 oz gold in the inferred mineral resource category. There is an additional 289,000 oz gold classified as open pit material outside the main La India Open Pit, some in permitted pits, which will be targeted for additional early mill feed (see details in table below). The plan is to add the substantial underground mineral resource, currently in excess of 1 Moz gold, to the mine plan once in production.\u201d\nIntroduction & Background to Update Mineral Resource Estimate (\u201cMRE\u201d)\nBetween December 2020 and June 2021 Condor completed a drilling programme totalling 59 new diamond drillholes for 3,413 m of drilling within the La India Open Pit Area. The focus of the drilling was twofold: (1) to infill near surface areas of the Mineral Resource, which includes a historical Pre-Feasibility Level Mineral Reserve, that would likely be mined in the initial years of the Life of Mine, and (2) to replace reverse circulation (\u201cRC\u201d) drill holes with diamond core drilling. In addition, Condor completed a drilling programme totalling 15 new diamond drillholes for 3,504 m of drilling on the Cacao vein (\u201cCacao\u201d) which is located approximately 6 km to the east of the La India Vein Set. The aim of the drilling at Cacao was to test the geological concept that the near surface gold mineralisation at Cacao marks the top of an epithermal gold system, and to test for a strike extension beyond the 450 m long outcrop where previous drilling has been focused.\nThe updated MRE was prepared by SRK and reported using the terminology, definitions and guidelines given in the CIM Code, was produced using industry standard practices, is consistent with SRK\u2019s approach for the Mineral Resource Estimates previously completed and is effective as of 28th February 2022.\nThe infill drilling and replacement of the RC drilling at La India, along with additional detailed deposit-scale surface mapping has resulted in increased confidence in the geological interpretations which is reflected in the new lithological-structural, mineralisation and weathering models. Additional benefits include validating and updating the depletion model associated with historic and artisanal mining activities and obtaining additional density measurements to supplement the existing database. Density values have been assigned to estimation domains and oxidation zones.\nThe additional drilling at Cacao and updated MRE has been successful in demonstrating the potential growth of the underground Mineral Resource on the Cacao vein. Drilling completed during 2021 confirmed the presence of the vein hidden below surface along strike to the east, extending the current known strike to 950 m. Drilling at depth has also returned wider intersections and higher grades than noted near surface: the best drilling intercept was returned from the current deepest drill hole some 260 m below surface. The vein remains open along strike in both directions and at depth. Further exploration is required to further test the potential of the vein.\nSampling, QAQC & Mineral Resource estimation methodology\nDrill core samples were prepared in the Bureau Veritas Inspectorate Laboratory in Managua, Nicaragua which is independent from Condor Gold. Pulp samples were then sent to Bureau Veritas analytical Laboratory in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The core samples were analysed for gold (0.005 ppm detection limit) by fire assay using AAS finish, and silver at a 2 ppm detection limit using four acid digest and AAS finish. Sample results higher than 10 g/t gold were systematically re-assayed using a gravimetric finish.\nCondor has routine quality control procedures in place which ensure that every batch of samples includes sample repeats, commercial standards and blanks. SRK has reviewed the QA/QC for the 2021 drilling, which included a site visit to La India and did not identify any biases within the assay data. In addition, SRK reviewed the data relating to the RC replacement drilling and confirmed the re-assayed samples agreed within acceptable levels with the original RC assays.\nSRK has prepared the MRE for the La India vein set utilising samples coded according to the geological model, with samples composited and capped per domain. SRK has reviewed and updated the statistical analysis, variography, grade interpolation and resource classification, for each domain, as well as an updated assessment of the reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.\nIn order to standardize the reporting approach SRK has reviewed the historical estimates for the Teresa, Arizona, Agua Caliente, Guapinol, San Lucas and Cristalito-Tatescame veins. These are still early-stage Mineral Resources and it was not considered appropriate to run open pit design algorithms, so the higher underground mining costs were applied as a default. This differs from the approach taken in the previous Mineral Resources estimated by SRK (22nd December 2011) in which costs intermediate between open pit and underground mining were applied. These Mineral Resources have been updated to reflect current price and cost assumptions for underground mining, represented by a 2.0 g/t cut-off grade over a minimum width of 1.0 m, as well as additional depletion to account for mining under a crown pillar.\nMineral Resources\nThe total MRE on La India Project does not reflect a material change in the number of ounces of gold reported, being 1,087 Koz in the Indicated Mineral Resource category and 1,189 Koz in the Inferred Mineral Resource category, where this represents only a slight reduction of 4.7% in the Indicated and 0.9% in the Inferred Mineral Resources compared to the previous MRE. The reduction in the ounces is due to a combination of factors including:\n-\nrefinements in the geological interpretation including steepening of the veins near surface on La India deposit.\n-\nslightly lower density values in some zones of La India deposit based on additional data and refined domaining.\n-\nan updated depletion model to reflect artisanal mining at La India Open Pit; and\n-\nan increase in the reporting cut-off from 0.5 g/t Au to 0.65 g/t Au for the open pit resources, and from 1.5 g/t Au to 2.0g/t Au along with the application of crown pillars (as depletion) to reflect assumed underground mining on several historical estimates.\nThe updated geological interpretations informing the MRE reflect a higher degree of detail which is warranted for a Feasibility level of study and is supported by closer-spaced infill and RC-replacement diamond drilling within the upper portion of the main La India pit, as well as additional detailed deposit-scale surface mapping. This information has been integrated with the previous data to inform a more robust litho-structural and weathering interpretation and an updated model of the historic and artisanal mine depletion.\nThe MRE continues to demonstrate the open pit and underground mining potential of the La India Project. In addition to the main La India Open Pit there are four satellite pits that have the potential to provide additional mineralized material to the fully permitted La India processing plant. At Cacao the updated MRE substantially increased the Mineral Resources potentially extractable by underground methods by 40 koz to 86 koz, and also marginally increased the potential open pit Mineral Resource by 1 koz to 15 koz, for a combined open pit and underground Mineral Resource of 101 koz gold.\nThe Mineral Resources for three of the satellite pits: La Mestiza vein set, America vein and Central Breccia, have not been updated as no new work has been completed since the previous January 2019 estimate. These three deposits represent an aggregate 206 Kt at 9.9 g/t Au for 66,000 oz in the indicated mineral resource category and 1,939 Kt at 3.3 g/t gold for 207,000 oz in the inferred mineral resource category. A drilling programme of 8,004m has been completed on the Mestiza Vein Set to infill the current Mineral Resources (RNS dated 10th March 2021). However, assay results were received after the cut-off date for inclusion in the MRE update. Therefore, at this stage these Mineral Resources for La Mestiza have not been updated but will be included in future estimates.\nTable 1 presents the Mineral Resource Statement for the La India Project (inclusive of the La India, America, La Mestiza, Cacao, Central Breccia, San Lucas and Cristalito-Tatescame deposits). Only the Mineral Resource estimates for the La India vein set and Cacao veins have been updated since the previous January 2019 MRE. The reporting criteria for the Teresa, Arizona, Agua Caliente, Guapinol, San Lucas and Cristalito-Tatescame veins has been updated to reflect a 2.0 g/t cut-off grade over a minimum width of 1.0 m and introduction of a crown pillar depletion. In completing the MREs, SRK has reviewed and completed the necessary validation via visual checks, statistical analysis and swath analysis sufficient to satisfy the requirement for reporting Mineral Resources in the appropriate categories. Table 2 presents the Mineral Resource Statement for the combined vein sets, effective 28 February 2022. Mineral Resources are reported inclusive of Mineral Reserves.\nTable 1: SRK CIM Compliant Mineral Resource Statement effective 28 February 2022 for La India Project\n| MINERAL RESOURCE STATEMENT SPLIT PER VEIN as of February 28, 2022(7),(8),(9),(10),(11) |\n| ||||||||\n| Category | Area Name | Vein Name | Cut-Off | gold | silver |\n| |||\n|\n| |||||||||\n| Tonnes (kt) | Au Grade (g/t) | Au (Koz) | Ag Grade (g/t) | Ag(Koz) |\n| ||||\n| Indicated | La India Vein Set | La India/ California(1)(6) | 0.65 g/t (OP) | 8,487 | 3.0 | 827 | 6.1 | 1,669 |\n|\n| La India/ California(2) | 2.0 g/t (UG) | 391 | 5.0 | 63 | 10.6 | 134 |\n| ||\n| America Vein Set | America Mine(3) | 0.5 g/t (OP) | 114 | 8.1 | 30 | 4.9 | 18 |\n| |\n| America Mine(4) | 2.0 g/t (UG) | 470 | 7.3 | 110 | 4.7 | 71 |\n| ||\n| Mestiza Vein Set | Tatiana(3) | 0.5 g/t (OP) | 92 | 12.1 | 36 | 19.5 | 57 |\n| |\n| Tatiana(4) | 2.0 g/t (UG) | 118 | 5.5 | 21 | 11.3 | 43 |\n| ||\n| Inferred | La India Vein Set | La India/ California(1)(6) | 0.65 g/t (OP) | 893 | 2.4 | 69 | 4.7 | 134 |\n|\n| Teresa(1) | 0.65 g/t (OP) | 5 | 6.4 | 1 |\n|\n|\n| ||\n| La India/ California(2) | 2.0 g/t (UG) | 1,142 | 5.6 | 206 | 12.2 | 446 |\n| ||\n| Teresa(2) | 2.0 g/t (UG) | 85 | 10.9 | 30 |\n|\n|\n| ||\n| Arizona(5) | 2.0 g/t (UG) | 399 | 4.3 | 56 |\n|\n|\n| ||\n| Agua Caliente(5) | 2.0 g/t (UG) | 43 | 9.0 | 13 |\n|\n|\n| ||\n| America Vein Set | America Mine(3) | 0.5 g/t (OP) | 677 | 3.1 | 67 | 5.5 | 120 |\n| |\n| America Mine(4) | 2.0 g/t (UG) | 1,008 | 4.8 | 156 | 6.8 | 221 |\n| ||\n| Guapinol(5) | 2.0 g/t (UG) | 497 | 5.9 | 94 |\n|\n|\n| ||\n| Mestiza Vein Set(9) | Tatiana(3) | 0.5 g/t (OP) | 220 | 6.6 | 47 | 13.6 | 97 |\n| |\n| Tatiana(4) | 2.0 g/t (UG) | 615 | 3.9 | 77 | 8.8 | 174 |\n| ||\n| Buenos Aires(3) | 0.5 g/t (OP) | 120 | 9.8 | 38 |\n|\n|\n| ||\n| Buenos Aires(4) | 2.0 g/t (UG) | 188 | 7.1 | 43 |\n|\n|\n| ||\n| Espenito(4) | 2.0 g/t (UG) | 181 | 8.4 | 49 |\n|\n|\n| ||\n| Central Breccia | Central Breccia(3) | 0.5 g/t (OP) | 922 | 1.9 | 56 |\n|\n|\n| |\n| San Lucas | San Lucas(5) | 2.0 g/t (UG) | 298 | 5.9 | 56 |\n|\n|\n| |\n| Cristalito-Tatescame | Cristalito-Tatescame(5) | 2.0 g/t (UG) | 185 | 5.5 | 33 |\n|\n|\n| |\n| Cacao | Cacao(1) | 0.65 g/t (OP) | 190 | 2.4 | 15 |\n|\n|\n| |\n| Cacao(2) | 2.0 g/t (UG) | 975 | 2.8 | 86 |\n|\n|\n| ||\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| (1) The La India and Cacao pits are amenable to open pit mining and the Mineral Resource Estimates are constrained within Whittle optimised pits, which SRK based on the following parameters: A Gold price of USD1,800 per ounce of gold with no adjustments.

The Company is a gold exploration and development company with a focus on Nicaragua.\nOn 25 October 2021 Condor announced the filing of a Preliminary Economic Assessment Technical Report (\u201cPEA\u201d) for its La India Project, Nicaragua on SEDAR https://www.sedar.com. The highlight of the technical study is a post-tax, post upfront capital expenditure NPV of US$418 million, with an IRR of 54% and 12 month pay-back period, assuming a US$1,700 per oz gold price, with average annual production of 150,000 oz gold per annum for the initial 9 years of gold production. The open pit mine schedules have been optimised from designed pits, bringing higher grade gold forward resulting in average annual production of 157,000 oz gold in the first 2 years from open pit material and underground mining funded out of cashflow. In August 2018, the Company announced that the Ministry of the Environment in Nicaragua had granted the Environmental Permit (\u201cEP\u201d) for the development, construction and operation of a processing plant with capacity to process up to 2,800 tonnes per day at its wholly-owned La India Gold Project (\u201cLa India Project\u201d). The EP is considered the master permit for mining operations in Nicaragua. Condor has purchased a new SAG Mill, which has mainly arrived in Nicaragua. Site clearance and preparation is at an advanced stage.\nEnvironmental Permits were granted in April and May 2020 for the La Mestiza and America open pits respectively, both located close to La India. The La Mestiza open pit hosts 92 Kt at a grade of 12.1 g/t gold (36,000 oz contained gold) in the Indicated Mineral Resource category and 341 Kt at a grade of 7.7 g/t gold (85,000 oz contained gold) in the Inferred Mineral Resource category. The America open pit hosts 114 Kt at a grade of 8.1 g/t gold (30,000 oz) in the Indicated Mineral Resource category and 677 Kt at a grade of 3.1 g/t gold (67,000 oz) in the Inferred Mineral Resource category. Following the permitting of the La Mestiza and America open pits, together with the La India Open Pit Condor has 1.12 M oz gold open pit Mineral Resources permitted for extraction.\nDisclaimer\nNeither the contents of the Company's website nor the contents of any website accessible from hyperlinks on the Company's website (or any other website) is incorporated into, or forms part of, this announcement.\nQualified Persons\nThe Mineral Resource Estimate has been completed by Ben Parsons, a Principal Consultant (Resource Geology) with SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc, who is a Member of the Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, MAusIMM(CP).

This drilling method enables collection of tubes of intact rock (core) and when successful gives the best possible quality samples for description, sampling and analysis of an ore body or mineralised structure. |\n| Fault | The plane along which two rock masses have moved or slide against each other in opposing directions |\n| Grade | The proportion of a mineral within a rock or other material. For gold mineralisation this is usually reported as grams of gold per tonne of rock (g/t) |\n| g/t | grams per tonne |\n| Indicated Mineral Resource | That part of a Mineral Resource for which tonnage, densities, shape, physical characteristics, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a reasonable level of confidence. It is based on exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes. The locations are too widely or inappropriately spaced to confirm geological and/or grade continuity but are spaced closely enough for continuity to be assumed. |\n| Inferred Mineral Resource | That part of a Mineral Resource for which tonnage, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a low level of confidence. It is inferred from geological evidence and assumed but not verified geological and/or grade continuity. It is based on information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that may be limited, or of uncertain quality and reliability, |\n| IRR | The Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is the discount rate that makes the net present value (NPV) of a project zero. In other words, it is the expected compound annual rate of return that will be earned on a project or investment |\n| Kt | Thousand tonnes |\n| Mineral Resource Estimate | A concentration or occurrence of material of economic interest in or on the Earth\u2019s crust in such a form, quality, and quantity that there are reasonable and realistic prospects for eventual economic extraction. The location, quantity, grade, continuity and other geological characteristics of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated from specific geological knowledge, or interpreted from a well constrained and portrayed geological model. |\n| Mineral Reserve | A \u2018Mineral Reserve\u2019 is the economically mineable part of a Measured and/or Indicated Mineral Resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined. Appropriate assessments and studies have been carried out and include consideration of and modification by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors. These assessments demonstrate at the time of reporting that extraction could reasonably be justified. Ore Reserves are sub-divided in order of increasing confidence into Probable Ore Reserves and Proved Ore Reserves. |\n| NI 43-101 | Canadian National Instrument 43-101 a common standard for reporting of identified mineral resources and mineral reserves |\n| NPV | Net Present Value (NPV) is the value of all future cash flows (positive and negative) over the entire life of an investment discounted to the present. NPV analysis is a form of intrinsic valuation and is used extensively across finance and accounting for determining the value of a business, investment security, capital project, new venture, cost reduction program, and anything that involves cash flow. It is after deducting the upfront capital cost |\n| Open pit mining | A method of extracting minerals from the earth by excavating downwards from the surface such that the ore is extracted in the open air (as opposed to underground mining). |\n| Strike length | The longest horizontal dimension of an ore body or zone of mineralisation. |\n| Vein | A sheet-like body of crystallised minerals within a rock, generally forming in a discontinuity or crack between two rock masses.

In parallel to advancing Ikkari through to PEA this year, we continue to apply our geological understanding of the area to improve our exploration model and methodology with the goal of making further discoveries of scale. Ikkari North is hidden mineralisation that has no surface expression and was discovered using a new deep geophysics survey. Sisnakka, 10km from the Pahtavaara mill, has been identified as part of a program targeting regional mineralising structures in similar geological settings.\"\nAn updated resource and accompanying preliminary economic assessment on the Ikkari discovery will be completed in H2 2022. Approximately 75,000m of drilling is budgeted for the next twelve months targeting resource additions through satellites or extensions to Ikkari and elsewhere on five regional target areas on Rupert\u2019s c.735km2 land package (Figure 1). Follow-up drilling has been completed or is underway at Jeesi\u00f6 and Sikavaara over BoT anomalies with assays pending for both. Elsewhere the first season of summer fieldwork is close to completion at Kuusaj\u00e4rvi where reconnaissance BoT is planned, subject to issuance of exploration licences.\nIkkari North\nThe target at Ikkari North was identified from an IP geophysical survey conducted across Ikkari, and extended to the north to include Hein\u00e4 Central. The survey identified a strong north-dipping chargeability anomaly that comes to surface approximately 500m to the north of the Ikkari mineralisation. Several drill holes have been completed, targeting the anomaly at depth due to restricted access to the near-surface target in wetter summer conditions. Broad, 100-200m wide intersections of a carbonate-altered and brecciated stack of fine-grained Savukoski sediments between undeformed mafic intrusive bodies have been observed. The breccia zone contains variable amounts of disseminated and semi-massive pyrite, especially around intercalated units of sediments. Assays and observations of visible gold grains, indicate that these pyrite zones are variably mineralised with gold and importantly, contain higher grade zones (e.g. #122154 - 5m of 9.8g/t Au from 246m) associated with silica-sericite alteration and quartz veining that is confined to siltstone units within the larger brecciated domain. Further, the drilling intersected shallow mineralisation (e.g. #122148 \u2013 16m of 1.1g/t Au from 58m and #122154 \u2013 2.6m of 11.7g/t from 8.4m) in a similar but narrower geological setting.\nThe strongest part of the IP anomaly occurs close to surface (Figure 3), and will be drill tested this winter as ground conditions allow.\nSisnakka\nAt Sisnakka, a first phase of drilling targeted multi-element base of till anomalies, with a significant base metals component (up to 3000ppm Cu). Hole #122114, targeting a structure highlighted by a steep magnetic gradient, intersected 4m of 3.2 g/t Au from 58m, including 1m of 10.10 g/t Au, within a brecciated structural zone comprising silica-albite altered intercalated sediments with pyrite, as well as a very narrow massive chalcopyrite(+gold) vein confined in a deformed and altered Savukoski ultramafic unit (1m of 7.38 g/t Au and 1.74% Cu from 128m).\nResults are pending for eight follow up holes, targeting extensions of the zone and associated structures in the area.\nHein\u00e4 Central\nFurther drilling at the Hein\u00e4 Central target has been focused on delineating mineralisation to be included in a preliminary resource estimate (to be published in H2 2022 as part of the Ikkari preliminary economic assessment) and incrementally extending the mineralized zone. Significant new results show depth extent in the main part of the deposit with #122064 intersecting 14m of 2.4g/t Au and 0.3% Cu from 319m (250m vertical), including 2m of 4.5g/t Au and 1.2% Cu.\nTo the east, mineralisation in #122130 (36m of 0.5g/t Au and 0.5% Cu from 142m, including 2m of 1.7g/t Au and 2.0% Cu) indicates some continuation of the zone in this direction, with strong copper grades offset from gold. Step out drilling to the east does indicate that the mineralization is narrowing and weakening, and further focus will be on tracing the down-plunge extent.\nGeological interpretation\nIkkari and Hein\u00e4 Central were discovered using systematic regional exploration that initially focused on geochemical sampling of the bedrock/till interface through glacial till deposits of 5m to 40m thickness. No outcrop is present, and topography is dominated by low-lying swamp areas.\nThe Ikkari deposit occurs within rocks that have been regionally mapped as 2.05-2.15 billion years (\"Ga\") old Savukoski group greenschist-metamorphosed mafic-ultramafic volcanic rocks, part of the Central Lapland Greenstone Belt (\"CLGB\"). Gold mineralisation is largely confined to the structurally modified unconformity at a significant domain boundary. Younger sedimentary lithologies are complexly interleaved, with intensely altered ultramafic rocks, and the mineralized zone is bounded to the north by a steeply N-dipping cataclastic zone. In general, alteration and structure appear to be sub-vertical, with lithologies generally dipping ~70 degrees north.\nThe main mineralized zone is strongly altered and characterised by intense veining and foliation that frequently overprint original textures. An early phase of finely laminated, grey ankerite/dolomite veins is overprinted by stockwork-like irregular siderite \u00b1 quartz \u00b1 chlorite \u00b1 sulphide veins. These vein arrays are often deformed with shear-related boudinage and in situ brecciation. Magnetite and/or haematite are common, in association with pyrite. Hydrothermal alteration commonly comprises quartz-dolomite-chlorite-magnetite (\u00b1haematite). Gold is hosted by disseminated and vein-related pyrite. Multi-phase breccias are well developed within the mineralised zone, with early silicified cataclastic phases overprinted by late, carbonate- iron-oxide- rich, hydrothermal breccias which display a subvertical control. All breccias frequently host disseminated pyrite, and are often associated with bonanza gold grades, particularly where magnetite or haematite is prevalent. In the sedimentary lithologies, albite alteration is intense and pervasive, with pyrite-magnetite (\u00b1 gold) hosted in veinlets in brittle fracture zones.\nAt Hein\u00e4 Central, the multiple sulphide zones identified (25 to >50% pyrrhotite + chalcopyrite + pyrite) are hosted by cataclastic quartz-dolomite breccia within a sedimentary sequence that includes interbedded siltstone and carbonaceous shale. This sequence is intruded by mafic dykes, and intermediate intrusives are also present. Brecciation is associated with a broad, complex, folded structural zone that is related to decoupling along lithological contacts and localised folding.\nFigures & Tables\nFigures and tables featured in the Appendix at end of release, include:\nFigure 1.

New Intercepts from regional drilling\nAbout the Rupert Lapland Project\nThe Rupert Lapland Project is located in the epicentre of the Central Lapland Greenstone Belt, Northern Finland, where the company has made six new discoveries including the high quality Ikkari Project with an inferred mineral resource estimate of 49Mt at 2.5 g/t gold for 3.95 million ounces1. The Rupert Lapland Project also contains the Pahtavaara mine and mill (on active care & maintenance) within a regional land package of some 735km2. The Company acquired the project for USD2.5m in 2016 and is undertaking exploration both at the existing mine and across the region to demonstrate the potential for significant economic mineralisation. The Ikkari deposit and five other discoveries are located in a structural corridor that lies between the Kittil\u00e4 Group allochthon to the north and the younger Kumpu Group basin to the south. The mineralised area is dominated by large E-W to ENE trending faults which have controlled broad to isoclinal folding within the sediment-dominated (Savukoski Group) rock package. A complex network of cross cutting structures has focused multi-stage fluid flow, with gold mineralisation associated with massive to fine-grained disseminated sulphides and concentrated at favourable structural intersections.\nReview by Qualified Person, Quality Control and Reports\nDr Charlotte Seabrook, MAIG, RPGeo., Exploration Manager of Rupert, is the Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101 responsible for the accuracy of scientific and technical information in this news release.\nSamples are prepared by ALS Finland in Sodankyl\u00e4 and assayed in ALS laboratories in Ireland, Romania or Sweden.

It was calculated using the multiple indicator kriging method (MIK) and is classified as an inferred mineral resource as defined by the CIM. Numbers are affected by rounding. The MRE was reported using cut-offs of 0.6g/t Au for mineralisation potentially mineable by open pit methods and 1.2g/t Au for that portion that is potentially extractable by underground methods. The cut-offs were based on a gold price of US$1430/oz Au, with a 92% overall recovery and costs derived from benchmarks and first principles (see: the Ikkari Technical Report). Mineral Resources do not include Mineral Reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.

Prices have been supported between about $1,700 and $1,800 an ounce, even as the Federal Reserve embarks on aggressive interest-rate hikes that normally reduce the metal\u2019s appeal.\nGold in China has also fetched a premium of about $7 to international prices, a relative high level that will have spurred local banks to import bullion, according to Kavalis. Only lenders with state-issued licenses are permitted to bring gold into China.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAMC\u2019s CEO Will Do Whatever It Takes to Keep His Company a Meme Forever\nChinese EV Maker BYD Aims to Conquer World Markets as the Un-Tesla\nWhole Foods\u2019 Battle Against Black Lives Matter Masks Has Much Higher Stakes\n\u00a92022 Bloomberg L.P.",

Traders are also hoping for hints of whether the Fed will hike interest rates by 75 basis points at its next meeting in September, or by 50 basis points. The amount depends on signs inflation is lessening.\nNew research by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York published Wednesday showed that coronavirus pandemic-induced strong demand was the main driver behind higher U.S. inflation in July, and that without supply chain bottlenecks the inflation rate would have been 6% instead of 9% at the end of 2021.\n\u201cIn the absence of any new energy or other shock, it is therefore possible that the ongoing easing of supply bottlenecks will cause a substantial drop in inflation in the near term,\u201d the report said.\nLatest Prices\n\u25cfBitcoin (BTC): $21,705 +0.8%\n\u25cfEther (ETH): $1,681 +1.6%\n\u25cfS&P 500 daily close: 4,140.77 +0.3%\n\u25cfGold: $1,765 per troy ounce +1.1%\n\u25cfTen-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.11% +0.05\nBitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

(\"Galiano\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: GAU) (NYSE American: GAU) is pleased to provide an update of drilling results at Nkran following the completion of an infill drilling program at the Asanko Gold Mine (\"AGM\"), located in Ghana. The AGM is a 50:50 joint venture (\"JV\") with Gold Fields Ltd (JSE, NYSE: GFI), with the JV managed and operated by Galiano.\nEffective February 28, 2022, Nkran has a Mineral Resource Estimate of 12.1 Mt at 2.09 g/t for 814 kozs indicated and 1.3 Mt at 2.23 g/t for 96 kozs inferred. The 2022 infill drilling program was designed to enhance confidence in the indicated Mineral Resource and explore for potential extensions of mineralization at Nkran.\nDrilling has intercepted several high-grade intervals within and below the resource shell as described in National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report for the Asanko Gold Mine, Ashanti Region, Ghana, effective date February 28, 20221 and confirms continuity of mineralization within areas where higher levels of confidence were warranted. Results are currently being incorporated into an updated Mineral Resource Estimate which is expected to support an updated Mineral Reserve Estimate anticipated in Q1 2023.\nNkran Infill Drilling Highlights\n24 diamond drill holes totalling 8,116m have been drilled at Nkran in 2022. Highlighted intercepts include:\nHole NKDD22-100: 16 meters @ 47.3 g/t gold from 13.6m and 41 meters @ 3.0 g/t gold from 135.4m\nHole NKDD22-099: 11 meters @ 27.6 g/t gold from 259m\nHole NKDD22-083: 49 meters @ 3.4 g/t gold from 261.7m and 58.50 meters @ 3.5 g/t gold from 336m\nHole NKDD22-086: 16 meters @ 5.4 g/t gold from 191m\nHole NKDD22-080: 45 meters @ 2.3 g/t gold from 107m\nHole NKDD22-105: 8 meters @ 10.4 g/t gold from 109m\nHole NKDD22-106: 59 meters @ 2.7 g/t gold from 330m\nNkran Overview (See Table 1 for full drilling results)\nThe Nkran pit is located immediately adjacent to the 5.8 million tonne per annum processing plant, and has historically yielded the highest average mined grades on the Asankrangwa Belt and contributed significant cash flows to the AGM. During the mining of cut 2, Nkran produced 15.2M tonnes at 1.63 g/t and reported metallurgical recoveries of 94%.\n\"We are encouraged by these results which demonstrate the continuity of high-grade mineralization below the previously mined portions of the Nkran deposit,\" said Matt Badylak President and Chief Executive Officer. \"This deposit has historically yielded significant cash flows due to its proximity to the processing plant, elevated grade profile and favourable metallurgy. It is important to note that mineralization extends below the current resource shell and remains open at depth. Going forward, we anticipate Nkran to be a key deposit in our upcoming Life of Mine Plan and are excited to incorporate these latest drilling results into an updated Technical Report scheduled for release in Q1 2023.\"\nNkran Geology and Cross Sections\nThe Nkran geological setting is typical of the Asankrangwa belt with a sedimentary sequence of interlayered shale, siltstone, and sandstone. Two granitic bodies intrude along shear zones that control mineralization which dips steeply to the northwest along with the sheared host stratigraphy.\nTable 1.

NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators that establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects. In accordance with NI 43-101, the Company uses the terms mineral reserves and resources as they are defined in accordance with the CIM Definition Standards on mineral reserves and resources (the \"CIM Definition Standards\") adopted by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum. In particular, the terms \"mineral reserve\", \"proven mineral reserve\", \"probable mineral reserve\", \"mineral resource\", \"measured mineral resource\", \"indicated mineral resource\" and \"inferred mineral resource\" used in this press release are Canadian mining terms defined in accordance with CIM Definition Standards. These definitions differ from the definitions in the disclosure requirements promulgated by the SEC. Accordingly, information contained in this press release may not be comparable to similar information made public by U.S. companies reporting pursuant to SEC disclosure requirements.\nUnited States investors are also cautioned that while the SEC will now recognize \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources\", investors should not assume that any part or all of the mineralization in these categories will ever be converted into a higher category of mineral resources or into mineral reserves. Mineralization described using these terms has a greater amount of uncertainty as to their existence and feasibility than mineralization that has been characterized as reserves. Accordingly, investors are cautioned not to assume that any \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\", or \"inferred mineral resources\" that the Company reports are or will be economically or legally mineable.\nFurther, \"inferred resources\" have a greater amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined legally or economically. Therefore, United States investors are also cautioned not to assume that all or any part of the inferred resources exist. In accordance with Canadian rules, estimates of \"inferred mineral resources\" cannot form the basis of feasibility or other economic studies, except in limited circumstances where permitted under NI 43-101.\nNeither Toronto Stock Exchange nor the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/galiano-gold-provides-nkran-drilling-update-301612844.html\nSOURCE Galiano Gold Inc.",

(TSX-V: ECR) (\u201cCartier\u201d) announces the results of its fourth mineral resource estimate for the Chimo Mine Gold System, located 45 km east of Val-d\u2019Or. The estimate, completed and made available on the effective date of August 22, 2022, was carried out by MM. Vincent Nadeau-Benoit, P.Geo., and Alain Carrier, P.Geo., M.Sc. from the firm InnovExplo Inc.; Independent Qualified Persons within the meaning of NI 43-101.\n\u201cThe results of the efforts primarily in drilling and resource estimates are intended to be integrated as quickly as possible into the preliminary economic studies of the Chimo Mine project to demonstrate its economic viability.\u201d commented Philippe Cloutier, President and CEO.\nThe recent acquisition of the West Nordeau deposit, within 450 m of the resources of the Chimo Mine property, makes it possible to integrate all the resources with common characteristics with a reasonable prospect of possible economic extraction.\nThe mineralization of the Chimo Mine Gold System consists of 28 gold zones that are part of 19 gold structures, themselves grouped into 3 gold corridors. The NI 43-101 resources in effect as of August 22, 2022 for this gold system, combining the resources of the Chimo Mine property with those of the West Nordeau deposit, are presented below.

The quantity and grade of Inferred Resources reported in this Mineral Resource Estimate is uncertain in nature and there can be no assurance that any or all of the Inferred Mineral Resources can be converted to Indicated Mineral Resources with further exploration drilling.\nThe mineral resource estimate of complies with the standards and guidelines in effect of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) as well as the NI 43-101 standard for the publication of mineral resources.\nThe requirement of a reasonable prospect of eventual economic extraction is met by having a minimum modeling width for mineralized zones, a cut-off grade based on reasonable inputs and an economic binding volume that lends itself to a potential scenario of underground extraction for undiluted in-situ resources. The constrained volume was achieved with the Deswik Stope Optimizer (\" DSO \") using a minimum mining volume of 10 m in width in the longitudinal orientation of the gold zones, by 10 m in height and 2 m in thickness varying up to a maximum of 25 m x 100 m x 15 m. The optimization was carried out using the respective cut-off grade of each of the gold corridors for the indicated and inferred resources. The results of the DSO were then used for the resource estimate statement.\nThe resource estimate is presented for potential underground scenarios at a cut-off grade of 2.0 g/t Au for the North and South Gold Corridors and 1.5 g/t Au for the Central Gold Corridor. The cut-off grade reflects the geometry and actual width of each of the gold corridors. The cut-off grade was calculated using the following main parameters:\nGold price of US $ 1,612 / oz;\nExchange rate of US $ 1.34 / CAD $ per troy ounce;\nCosts relating to the Central Gold Corridor for:\nDefinition drilling of CAD $ 3 / t;\nDevelopment, mining, transport and milling of CAD $ 50.75 / t;\nEnvironmental restoration of CAD $ 0.75 / t;\nCosts relating to the North and South Gold Corridors for:\nDefinition drilling of CAD $ 6 / t;\nDevelopment, mining, transport and milling of CAD $ 75.50 / t ;\nEnvironmental restoration of CAD $ 1.50 / t;\nFor the Chimo Mine property: Triple Flag Precious Metals royalty cost of CAD $ 20.96 / troy ounce;\nFor the West Nordeau deposit: Globex Mining Enterprises Inc. royalty cost of CAD $ 64.80 / troy ounce;\nGeneral and administrative costs of 12 $ CAD / t.\nFor the Chimo Mine property, the estimate was carried out on 17 3D solids corresponding to the structures constituting the Northern Gold Corridor (structures: 1A, 1B, 2, 3 and 4B), South (structures: 6, 6B, 6C, 6P and 6P2) and Central (structures: 5B, 5B2, 5C, 5M, 5M2, 5N and 6N1) of the Chimo Mine property whose minimum actual thickness is 2.40 m and the average thickness is 7.42 m. For the West Nordeau deposit, 8 structures were modeled using a minimum real thickness of 2.4 m, including 5 structures for the North Gold Corridor and 3 structures for the Central Gold Corridor. The contents of the samples analyzed are used when they are available otherwise in the absence of analytical content, a value of zero is assigned.\nThe density value of 2.90 g/cm3 (to 3.10 g/cm3) supported by measurements, was applied to all gold structures.\nThe estimate for the Chimo Mine property was made from a database made up, as of September 1, 2020, of 3,658 holes totaling 290,419 m drilled, 18,612 deviation measurements as well as 81,413 samples analyzed for gold and collected over a core length of 88,035 m representing 30% of the core length drilled. This database contains 2,383 blank and standard samples, inserted for QA/QC by Cartier between November 1, 2016 and September 1, 2020. This database was validated before starting the resource estimate. The estimate was carried out on 17 mineralized structures, intersected by 67,103 m of drilling, having produced 8,611 different gold intersections.\nThe estimate of the West Nordeau deposit was made from a database consisting, as of July 12, 2022, of 154 drill holes totaling 55,097 m drilled, 6,873 deviation measurements as well as 18,973 samples analyzed for the gold and collected over a core length of 19,785 m representing 36% of the core length drilled. This database contains 820 blank and standard samples, inserted for QA/QC by previous operators: Chalice Gold Mines Limited and O3 Mining Inc. between March 11, 2017 and March 17, 2020. This database was validated before starting the resource estimate. The estimate was carried out on 8 mineralized structures, intersected by 4,982 m of drilling, having produced 802 different gold intersections.\nHigh grade capping was carried out from statistical analysis data at each of the gold structures for values varying between 30 g/t Au and 120 g/t Au from the grade of the composites, also using the grade adjacent material or a value of zero when adjacent material has not been analyzed.\nThe underground openings (open or backfilled-cemented mine sites, drifts, raises and shafts) were modeled from transverse and longitudinal sections as well as detailed historical geological and mining plans. Historical underground production has been subtracted from the resource estimate.\nThe Chimo Mine resource estimate was performed using GEOVIA GEMS 6.8.2. Software, from capped and composited analyses, constrained by the modeled structures. The ordinary kriging method was used to interpolate the block model composed of blocks of dimension 5.0 m x 5.0 m x 5.0 m. For the West Nordeau deposit, gold resources were estimated using Leapfrog Edge v.2021.2.5 software from capped and composite analyses, constrained by the modeled structures. The ordinary kriging method was used to interpolate a model with sub-blocks (size of a parent block = 5.0 m x 5.0 m x 5.0 m).\nThe mineral resource estimate presented here is classified as indicated and inferred resources. The indicated category is defined by a minimum of 3 drill holes located within a 25 m radius and the presumed category is defined by a minimum of 2 drill holes located within a 65 m radius, where there is reasonable continuity of geology and gold grades.\nOunce troy is metric tons multiplied by grade (g/t) and divided by the constant of 31.10348. The number of tonnes has been rounded to the nearest thousand. Any discrepancy in the totals is due to rounding effects. The rounding complies with the recommendations of NI 43-101.\nThe qualified persons are not aware of any problem related to the environment, permits, mining titles or related to legal, fiscal, socio-political, commercial issues or any other relevant factor not mentioned in this press release, that could have a significant impact on the 2022 mineral resource estimate.\nThe table of the sensitivity of the cut-off grades on the resources of the Chimo Mine Gold System are presented below:\nCut-off Grade (g/t Au)\nNorth Gold Corridor\nCentral Gold Corridor\nSouth Gold Corridor\nMetric Tonnes (t)\nGrade (g/t Au)\nTroy Ounces (oz Au)\nMetric Tonnes (t)\nGrade (g/t Au)\nTroy Ounces (oz Au)\nMetric Tonnes (t)\nGrade (g/t Au)\nTroy Ounces (oz Au)\nINDICATED RESOURCES\n1.0\n2,311,000\n2.64\n196,000\n8,105,000\n2.41\n627,000\n843,000\n2.62\n71,000\n1.5\n1,607,000\n3.21\n166,000\n5,565,000\n2.96\n529,000\n630,000\n3.06\n62,000\n2.0\n1,119,000\n3.85\n139,000\n3,856,000\n3.49\n433,000\n444,000\n3.61\n52,000\n2.5\n785,000\n4.52\n114,000\n2,725,000\n4.03\n353,000\n293,000\n4.25\n40,000\nINFERRED RESOURCES\n1.0\n4,583,000\n2.19\n323,000\n23,699,000\n2.06\n1,572,000\n4,830,000\n2.24\n348,000\n1.5\n2,714,000\n2.84\n248,000\n14,812,000\n2.56\n1,221,000\n2,897,000\n2.91\n271,000\n2.0\n1,714,000\n3.54\n195,000\n9,167,000\n3.07\n904,000\n1,949,000\n3.47\n217,000\n2.5\n1,240,000\n4.01\n160,000\n5,966,000\n3.52\n675,000\n1,351,000\n3.96\n172,000\nThe above table illustrates the sensitivity of this mineral resource estimate to different cut-off grades for underground operation scenarios with reasonable prospects for economic extraction.

With the 19% improvement in production achieved in the second quarter, the net cash generation from operations was US$780,000 which is a satisfying improvement in such a short period. As well as the continued investment in underground drilling to grow the mineral resource at Palito, we have continued to update the mining fleet with an additional US$1.5 million spent on capital equipment in the second quarter compared with less than $400,000 in the same period of 2021 and we continue to progress the mine development at Coringa. This capital programme together with the underground drilling activities are the platform for building the future production growth and complement the continued potential presented by the regional exploration that is attracting external interest.\u201d\n\u201cWhilst production of 8,419 ounces of gold for the three months to June represented an improvement of 1.358 ounces compared with the quarter to 31 March, sales in the last three months were 9,427 ounces. This sales growth is reflected in the higher level of production costs compared to the first quarter of 2022. Whilst some of this increase reflects the release of inventory, the balance reflects the increased unit costs of consumable items. Headcount has been reduced since the start of 2022 by seven per cent although the costs savings associated with these reductions will only be fully realised in future periods.\u201d\n\u201cThe cash position remains strong, with cash held at 30 June 2022 of US$9.8 million with a further US$1.9 million received shortly after the month end for a sale of copper/gold concentrate following a small delay to sailing schedules.\u201d\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU)

Basis of preparation\nThese unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements are for the three and six month periods ended 30 June 2022. Comparative information has been provided for the unaudited three and six month periods ended 30 June 2021 and, where applicable, the audited twelve month period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the disclosures that would otherwise be required in a complete set of financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the 2021 annual report.\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 \u201cInterim Financial Reporting\u201d and the accounting policies are consistent with those of the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021 and those envisaged for the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2022.\nAccounting standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2022\nThe Group has not adopted any standards or interpretations in advance of the required implementation dates.\nThe following Accounting standards came into effect as of 1 January 2022\n|\n| Effective Date |\n| Property, Plant and Equipment \u2013 Proceeds before Intended Use (amendments to IAS 16) | 1 January 2022 |\n| Onerous Contracts- Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (Amendments to IAS 37) | 1 January 2022 |\n| Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020 | 1 January 2022 |\n| Reference to Conceptual Framework (Amendments to IFRS 3) | 1 January 2022 |\nThe adoption of these standards has had no effect to date on the financial results of the Group. The updated standard Property, Plant and Equipment \u2013 Proceeds before Intended Use (amendments to IAS 16) which is effective 1 January 2022 will impact the Group as it develops the Coringa mine. At such time as the Group generates revenues from the processing of ore from Coringa in future periods, this will be reflected as operational revenue of the business and the Group will account for the costs incurred in relation to this income as a cost of sale. Previously, under IAS16, the sales would have been treated as a deduction from the cost of bringing an item (or items) of property, plant and equipment to the location and condition necessary to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.\nThere are a number of standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations which have been issued that are effective in future periods and which the Group has chosen not to adopt early.\n|\n| Effective Date |\n| IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts, including Amendments to IFRS 17 | 1 January 2023 |\n| Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (Amendments to IAS 1) and Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current \u2013 Deferral of Effective Date | 1 January 2023 |\nThese financial statements do not constitute statutory accounts as defined in Section 434 of the Companies Act 2006.\n(i) Going concern\nAt 30 June 2022, the Group held cash of US$9.8 million with a further receipt of US$1.9 million for a sale of copper/gold concentrate due to be received in early July having been delayed from June following a small delay to sailing schedules. The reduction in cash reflects the continued development expenditure of Coringa during the quarter].\nThe Group has advised that in light of the issues encountered in the mining of the Julia Vein at S\u00e3o Chico, it has reduced its production guidance for the remainder of 2022 whilst it reconfigures the Julia Vein for selective mining and undertakes further evaluation and development of other sectors of the S\u00e3o Chico deposit. This will reduce revenue for the rest of 2022 and will therefore impact on the ability of the Group to generate positive cash flow for the rest of 2022. Management have already taken actions to reduce some of the operational costs and is evaluating further options to generate additional gold production to improve cash generation. This includes the transportation and processing of high grade ore recovered from the current mine development being undertaken at Coringa. The first trucks began transporting ore during May 2022. In addition, in the short term, the Group has negotiated a US$5 million unsecured loan with a Brazilian bank for an initial 12 month period to ease any immediate working capital pressure. These funds were received during May 2022.\nThe Directors prepared, in March 2022, an operational plan and cash flow forecast based on their best judgement of the operational performance of the Group for the next 18 months using economic assumptions that the Directors consider are reasonable in the current global economic climate. This plan assumes, inter alia, that during the rest of 2022 and for 2023, the Group will be successful in mining higher levels of gold from its Palito orebody than it originally planned for and will continue to generate a limited level of gold production from S\u00e3o Chico, albeit at lower levels than 2021 and those previously planned for 2022, due to the issues encountered at the Julia Vein. In addition, the Group will, as an interim measure, transport Coringa ore for processing at the Palito Complex. To manage costs, discretionary expenditures will be minimised including further regional exploration drilling which has now been suspended.\nAlthough the Group\u2019s operational plan incorporates the processing of some of the ore recovered from the planned development of the Coringa mine at the Palito complex, the Group\u2019s plan is to construct a gold processing plant at Coringa. The estimated cost of the full-scale development of the Coringa project reported in the Coringa PEA, including necessary mine development, the erection of a gold processing plant and other site infrastructure was estimated to be approximately US$24.7 million before sustainable positive cash flow is achieved.\nWhile the Group plans to restrict development activity to a level that can be supported by available financial resources, in order to fund the longer term continued development of Coringa including a gold processing facility, and repay the Group\u2019s debt, which comprises a 12 month, US$5 million bank loan maturing in May 2023, the Group intends to obtain additional funding. This funding may be generated from a variety of sources which could include a combination of bank debt, royalty, streaming of gold and copper revenues, new equity capital and cash flow from the current operations. The Group has been successful in raising funding as and when required in the past and the Directors consider that the Group continues to have strong support from its major shareholders who have been supportive of and provided additional funding when required on previous occasions.\nAs such, whilst the expenditure on the development of Coringa will be incurred over a period of nine to twelve months it is the intention of management that firm commitments for the majority of this funding must have been secured and there is strong confidence that the balance of any remaining financing requirement is available prior to commencing the full-scale development.\nWhilst recognising the uncertainty that has been created by the need to adjust the operational plan during the first half of the year and the lower levels of gold production that are now forecast as a result, the Directors and management are confident of their ability to raise additional finance and that the Group\u2019s operations will perform at the levels that they now anticipate over the next 18 month period. However, an inability to raise new finance, unplanned interruptions or further reductions in gold production, unforeseen reductions of the gold price or appreciation of the Brazilian Real could adversely affect the level of free cash flow available to the Group.\nThese material uncertainties may cast significant doubt upon the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern and therefore its ability to settle its debts and realise its assets in the normal course of business. Notwithstanding these material uncertainties, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in existence for the foreseeable future and have concluded it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements. The financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the Group was unable to continue as a going concern.\n2.

Taxation\nThe Group has recognised a deferred tax asset to the extent that the Group has reasonable certainty as to the level and timing of future profits that might be generated and against which the asset may be recovered. The deferred tax liability arising on unrealised exchange gains has been eliminated in the six-month period to 30 June 2022 reflecting the stronger Brazilian Real exchange rate at the end of the period and resulting in deferred tax income of US$199,222 (six months to 30 June 2021 \u2013 charge of US$1,930,025).\nThe Group has also incurred a tax charge in Brazil for the six month period of US$593,744 (six months to 30 June 2021 - US$889,802).\n4.

Post balance sheet events\nSubsequent to the end of the period, there has been no item, transaction or event of a material or unusual nature likely, in the opinion of the Directors of the Company to affect significantly the continuing operation of the entity, the results of these operations, or the state of affairs of the entity in future financial periods.\nQualified Persons Statement\nThe scientific and technical information contained within this announcement has been reviewed and approved by Michael Hodgson, a Director of the Company.

Based on the results of this work, the Company's management are satisfied that the Company's own facility shows good correlation with independent laboratory facilities. The Company would expect that in the preparation of any future independent Reserve/Resource statement undertaken in compliance with a recognised standard, the independent authors of such a statement would not use Palito assay results but only use assay results reported by an appropriately certificated laboratory.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this announcement are, or may be deemed to be, forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are identi\ufb01ed by their use of terms and phrases such as \u2018\u2018believe\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018could\u2019\u2019, \u201cshould\u201d \u2018\u2018envisage\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018estimate\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018intend\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018may\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018plan\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2018will\u2019\u2019 or the negative of those, variations or comparable expressions, including references to assumptions. These forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts but rather on the Directors\u2019 current expectations and assumptions regarding the Company\u2019s future growth, results of operations, performance, future capital and other expenditures (including the amount, nature and sources of funding thereof), competitive advantages, business prospects and opportunities. Such forward looking statements re\ufb02ect the Directors\u2019 current beliefs and assumptions and are based on information currently available to the Directors. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements including risks associated with vulnerability to general economic and business conditions, competition, environmental and other regulatory changes, actions by governmental authorities, the availability of capital markets, reliance on key personnel, uninsured and underinsured losses and other factors, many of which are beyond the control of the Company. Although any forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are based upon what the Directors believe to be reasonable assumptions, the Company cannot assure investors that actual results will be consistent with such forward looking statements.\nENDS\nAttachment",

Furthermore, we're very pleased to see Horizon Copper complete the first part of its RTO and solidify its position as Sandstorm's strategic partner for future acquisitions.\"\nAs part of the Sale Transaction, Sandstorm transferred to Horizon its 30% interest in Hod Maden as well as US$10 million in cash and a 25% equity stake in Entr\u00e9e Resources Ltd.1 (\"Entr\u00e9e\") (collectively, the \"RTO Part A Assets\"). Consideration for the RTO Part A Assets provided to Sandstorm by Horizon include the Hod Maden Gold Stream, an approximate 34% equity interest in Horizon Copper2 common shares, and a secured convertible promissory note with a principal amount of US$95 million. For full details see the Company's press releases dated February 17, 2022, May 2, 2022, and May 26, 2022.\nUnder the terms of the Hod Maden Gold Stream, Horizon will sell to Sandstorm gold ounces equal to 20% of all gold produced from Hod Maden (on a 100% basis) at a price equal to 50% of the gold spot price until 405,000 ounces of gold are delivered (the \"Delivery Threshold\"). Once the Delivery Threshold has been reached, Horizon Copper will sell to Sandstorm 12% of the gold produced for the life of the mine for a price equal to 60% of the gold spot price. The Hod Maden Gold Stream will be secured by Horizon's indirect interest in the Hod Maden project.\nThe second part of the transaction, independent of RTO Part A, will encompass the acquisition of a 1.66% net profits interest on the low-cost, high-grade Antamina copper mine from Sandstorm (the \"RTO Part B\" and together with the RTO Part A, the \"Transaction\") and is expected to close in the second half of 2022. RTO Part B is contingent, among other conditions, on Horizon completing the proposed concurrent financing for gross proceeds of a minimum of US$20 million (the \"Concurrent Financing\") payable to Sandstorm as described in Horizon Copper's Management Information Circular available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com under its issuer profile.\nUpon completion of the Transaction, Horizon Copper will continue to be listed on the TSX Venture Exchange as a Tier 1 Mining Issuer under the anticipated trading symbol \"HCU\".

Sandstorm holds a portfolio of 250 royalties, of which 39 of the underlying mines are producing. Sandstorm plans to grow and diversify its low cost production profile through the acquisition of additional gold royalties. For more information visit: www.sandstormgold.com.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENTS TO U.S. SECURITYHOLDERS\nThe financial information included or incorporated by reference in this press release or the documents referenced herein has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, which differs from US generally accepted accounting principles (\"US GAAP\") in certain material respects, and thus are not directly comparable to financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP.\nThis press release and the documents incorporated by reference herein, as applicable, have been prepared in accordance with Canadian standards for the reporting of mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates, which differ from the previous and current standards of the United States securities laws. In particular, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the terms \"mineral reserve\", \"proven mineral reserve\", \"probable mineral reserve\", \"inferred mineral resources,\", \"indicated mineral resources,\" \"measured mineral resources\" and \"mineral resources\" used or referenced herein and the documents incorporated by reference herein, as applicable, are Canadian mineral disclosure terms as defined in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 \u2014 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\") and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the \"CIM\") \u2014 CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council, as amended (the \"CIM Definition Standards\").\nFor United States reporting purposes, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") has adopted amendments to its disclosure rules (the \"SEC Modernization Rules\") to modernize the mining property disclosure requirements for issuers whose securities are registered with the SEC under the Exchange Act, which became effective February 25, 2019. The SEC Modernization Rules more closely align the SEC's disclosure requirements and policies for mining properties with current industry and global regulatory practices and standards, including NI 43-101, and replace the historical property disclosure requirements for mining registrants that were included in SEC Industry Guide 7. Issuers were required to comply with the SEC Modernization Rules in their first fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2021. As a foreign private issuer that is eligible to file reports with the SEC pursuant to the multi-jurisdictional disclosure system, the Corporation is not required to provide disclosure on its mineral properties under the SEC Modernization Rules and will continue to provide disclosure under NI 43-101 and the CIM Definition Standards. Accordingly, mineral reserve and mineral resource information contained or incorporated by reference herein may not be comparable to similar information disclosed by United States companies subject to the United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nAs a result of the adoption of the SEC Modernization Rules, the SEC now recognizes estimates of \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources.\" In addition, the SEC has amended its definitions of \"proven mineral reserves\" and \"probable mineral reserves\" to be \"substantially similar\" to the corresponding CIM Definition Standards that are required under NI 43-101. While the SEC will now recognize \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources\", U.S. investors should not assume that all or any part of the mineralization in these categories will be converted into a higher category of mineral resources or into mineral reserves without further work and analysis. Mineralization described using these terms has a greater amount of uncertainty as to its existence and feasibility than mineralization that has been characterized as reserves. Accordingly, U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources, or inferred mineral resources that the Company reports are or will be economically or legally mineable without further work and analysis. Further, \"inferred mineral resources\" have a greater amount of uncertainty and as to whether they can be mined legally or economically. Therefore, U.S. investors are also cautioned not to assume that all or any part of inferred mineral resources will be upgraded to a higher category without further work and analysis. Under Canadian securities laws, estimates of \"inferred mineral resources\" may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases. While the above terms are \"substantially similar\" to CIM Definitions, there are differences in the definitions under the SEC Modernization Rules and the CIM Definition Standards. Accordingly, there is no assurance any mineral reserves or mineral resources that the Company may report as \"proven mineral reserves\", \"probable mineral reserves\", \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources\" under NI 43-101 would be the same had the Company prepared the reserve or resource estimates under the standards adopted under the SEC Modernization Rules or under the prior standards of SEC Industry Guide 7.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\", within the meaning of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation, concerning the business, operations and financial performance and condition of Sandstorm Gold Royalties. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the expectation that the Horizon Copper RTO Part B will be consummated, including whether conditions to the consummation of the Transaction will be satisfied, or the timing for completing the Transaction including whether the proposed Concurrent Financing will be complete; expectations that Horizon Copper will become Sandstorm's strategic partner for future acquisitions; Sandstorm's intent with respect to future acquisitions or disposition of securities of Horizon; expectations regarding financial strength, trading liquidity, and capital markets profile; the future price of gold, silver, copper, iron ore and other metals; the estimation of mineral reserves and mineral resources, and realization of mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates; the timing and amount of estimated future production; and expectations for other economic, business, and/or competitive factors.

Such statements and information are based on numerous assumptions regarding present and future business strategies and the environment in which Sandstorm Gold Royalties will operate in the future, including the receipt of all required approvals, the price of gold and copper and anticipated costs. Certain important factors that could cause actual results, performances or achievements to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, amongst others, failure to receive necessary approvals, changes in business plans and strategies, market conditions, share price, best use of available cash, gold and other commodity price volatility, discrepancies between actual and estimated production, mineral reserves and resources and metallurgical recoveries, mining operational and development risks relating to the parties which produce the gold or other commodity the Company will purchase, regulatory restrictions, activities by governmental authorities (including changes in taxation), currency fluctuations, the global economic climate, dilution, share price volatility and competition.\nForward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause the actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, including but not limited to: the impact of general business and economic conditions, the absence of control over mining operations from which the Company will purchase gold, other commodities or receive royalties from, and risks related to those mining operations, including risks related to international operations, government and environmental regulation, actual results of current exploration activities, conclusions of economic evaluations and changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined, risks in the marketability of minerals, fluctuations in the price of gold and other commodities, fluctuation in foreign exchange rates and interest rates, stock market volatility, as well as those factors discussed in the section entitled \"Risks to Sandstorm\" in the Company's annual report for the financial year ended December 31, 2021 and the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" contained in the Company's annual information form dated March 31, 2022 available at www.sedar.com. Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that are contained or incorporated by reference, except in accordance with applicable securities laws.\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sandstorm-gold-royalties-completes-sale-of-hod-maden-interest-and-concurrent-gold-stream-with-horizon-copper-301615860.html\nSOURCE Sandstorm Gold Ltd.\nView original content to download multimedia: http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/August2022/31/c8637.html",

Gold is typically considered a hedge against inflation, but higher interest rates make gold and other commodities less attractive because they pay no interest. There has been additional pressure on gold prices after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powells recent comments that the Fed will continue to aggressively raise interest rates.\nGold has also seen pressure from the stronger dollar, which has spiked to its highest levels since 2002. A stronger dollar makes bullion expensive for overseas buyers and international markets are an important source of gold demand.\nGold history\nWith government liquidity-driven inflation on consumers minds today, investors are seeking protection from these rising prices. Physical gold as well as gold mining equities are often seen as a primary hedge against inflation.\nGold is still considered a rare element and a precious metal that has been used for currency, jewelry and other industrial uses for thousands of years. The gold standard was often utilized in monetary policy in the U.S. and other countries off and on since the 1870s. But in 1971, this concept was abandoned for a fiat or paper currency that exists today.\nGold prices rose to over $2,000 per ounce in August 2020 due to government stimulus ramped up to fight the negative effects of the Covid pandemic. The commodity also reached $2,000 per ounce in March 2022 as record inflation began to take hold. Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin were once thought to be an inflation hedge and a perhaps as a substitute for gold, but that concept has not come to fruition in any meaningful way.\nFinancial review\nNewmont reported second-quarter results on July 25. Revenue was flat at $3.1 billion and adjusted Ebitda decreased 28% to $1.1 billion. The companys earnings were negatively affected by higher labor, materials and consumables costs as well as higher fuel and energy costs.",

Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, was up 1.7% to $1,598.\nBinance, the world's largest crypto exchange by volume, said it would move to stop supporting the stablecoins USDC, USDP and TUSD, with a plan to automatically convert users' holdings of those coins into its own stablecoin, BUSD, on Sept. 29.\nPoolin, one of the largest bitcoin mining pools, suspended withdrawals as part of an effort to preserve assets and stabilize liquidity.\nPrices for GPU Computer Chips Slide Toward MSRP as Ethereum Merge Approaches\nBy Sam Reynolds\nAs cryptocurrency entered the mainstream, the price of graphics processing units (GPU) for personal computers was often tied to the fate of the crypto market because they became popular for cryptocurrency mining. Now, with an end to Ethererum proof-of-work mining on the horizon thanks to the upcoming Merge and its shift to a proof-of-stake blockchain system, prices for GPUs are dropping like a rock.\nA bull market for crypto has, in the recent past, come with a bull market for GPU prices. At the height of ether\u2019s 2021 rally, some of the most powerful GPUs were retailing for an average of 114% over their manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price (MSRP). After all, for proof-of-work-based protocols \u2014 what Ethereum uses currently, since its launch in 2015 \u2014 GPUs and their parallel processing ability have been essential for mining.\nBut that was before The Merge. Ethereum\u2019s shift away from computationally intensive proof-of-work to proof-of-stake means that the tens of millions of GPUs purchased over the last four years to mine ether no longer have a use. Some miners are considering moving their operations to Ethereum Classic, but despite the protocol being around for nearly six years it just hasn\u2019t garnered the network effect needed to allure a critical mass of decentralized apps, non-fungible tokens (NFT) or decentralized finance (DeFi).\nGPU prices are reflecting this. According to published data from industry analyst house Jon Peddie, overall GPU unit shipments decreased by 15% from last quarter. Part of this comes from a softening PC market, with analysts at IDC forecasting a 12.8% year-over-year decline for 2022. The rapid quarter-over-quarter drop in GPU prices puts the blame squarely on evaporating demand from crypto miners.\nAccording to GPUTracker.eu, prices for some of the most popular GPUs are down by double-digits. The RTX 3080 Ti, a once-favorite for miners, has seen its average selling price drop by 45% in the last quarter, putting it almost at MSRP. In February, the card was being sold for around $2,000; now it's just over $1,100.\nIn China, wholesalers can\u2019t get rid of these cards fast enough as inventory piles up from mining farms trying to offload supply.\nAll this is being felt on Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) bottom line. During recent earnings, the company said its gaming line (read: GPUs that were being used for mining) was down 33% on the year to $2.04 billion \u2013 sharper than executives anticipated. Its dedicated crypto mining chip revenue also fell, but sales of these chips represent a small fraction of the silicon the company sold to miners.\nIn many ways, executives at Nvidia couldn\u2019t be happier. Jensen Huang, Nvidia\u2019s CEO, never was too comfortable with miners pilfering what he thought should have been for gamers or other users of the chips.\n\u201cGaming is growing, workstation is growing, AI hyperscale data center is growing, high-performance computing is growing. Quite frankly, I'd prefer that our GPUs were built to be used in those areas,\" he was quoted as saying at the company\u2019s annual technology conference in 2018. \"My preference would be, of course, that we allocate them for the people we build them for, but there's a logical reason for why [miners use] Nvidia GPUs, because it's the world's largest distributed supercomputer.\"\nIt looks like Huang and Nvidia will get their way. They just need the grit to deal with a few quarters of decline that comes just as the broader PC sector comes off its COVID-19 supercycle. The question is, will it recover as quickly without mining? Investors, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, would like to know.\nHeadlines\nEther Eyes Price Rally After 'Wedge' Breakout: Ether looked north, having exited a falling wedge pattern last week, analysts said.

BTC, which had been hovering well over $22,500 just before the release of the report, plunged over 5% in the hour after the CPI release and kept spiraling.\nEther, the second-biggest crypto in market value, followed a similar pattern and was changing hands under $1,600, a roughly 6% decline from a day earlier as inflation worries trumped Merge excitement. The Merge, the shifting of the Ethereum blockchain from a slower, more energy sapping proof-of-work protocol to proof-of-stake is supposed to occur Thursday, although recent ETH activity, even before the disappointing CPI, has suggested that the most significant price increases have already occurred.\nOther major altcoins spent the day in a deep red funk with SOL and AVAX recently off more than 12% and 9%, respectively.\n\"Struggling is the right word,\" Raghu Yarlagadda, co-founder and CEO of FalconX, told CoinDesk TV. \"People weren't expecting 8.3%.\"\nYarlagadda said the August CPI, which economic observers had expected to sink to 8.1%, offered the latest evidence that inflation remained a threat to the U.S. economy, and that the Federal Reserve would be more inclined to raise interest rates a third consecutive time by 75 basis points at its Federal Open Market Committee meeting next week.\n\"[The] Fed was very clear that they're gonna fight inflation first and then prioritize the soft landing,\" he said. \"What that means is that it's going to be making some aggressive moves.\" He added: \"The inflation data will probably create some drag on risk-on assets, and that's going to spill over into crypto.\"\nAs they've largely done in recent months, crypto prices dovetailed with equity markets, which also tumbled on Tuesday. The technology-heavy Nasdaq, the S&P 500, which has a strong tech component, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average struggled through their worst day since June 2020 with the Nasdaq plunging more than 5%. Market observers had expected falling energy prices to spur a more favorable CPI, but food and housing costs remain stubbornly high.\nCrypto news\nThe executive exodus from cryptocurrency hedge fund and venture-capital investor Pantera Capital continued with Chief Financial Officer Ryan Davis leaving, as CoinDesk's Nick Baker reported Tuesday. His departure follows the exit of Chief Technical Officer Terence Schofield, Chief Operating Officer Samir Shah and other employees.\nEarlier in the day, lawyers for Craig Wright, the Australian computer scientist best known for claiming to be the inventor of Bitcoin, said he will not provide any new cryptographic proof that he is Satoshi Nakamoto during his trial against Bitcoiner Hodlonaut, which began in Oslo on Monday.\nMeanwhile, Yarlagadda noted that financial institutions have been strongly opinionated about the Merge's impact on pricing with some seeing it as a \"starting point for something bigger,\" but others believing increases last month already accounted for the change. \"Both sides are extremely passionate, but I don't think there is strong conviction that ETH is going to be rallying right after the Merge,\" he said. \"Retail seems to be on both sides of the fence at this point, based on what we're seeing.\"\nCalifornia's Crypto Overstep\nBy Sam Reynolds\nThe Merge isn\u2019t the only big crypto event this week.\nCalifornia\u2019s new digital assets bill which singles out stablecoins and currently awaits Governor Gavin Newsom\u2019s signature could reshape the world\u2019s digital asset industry, given the state\u2019s size and importance in the cryptocurrency industry.\nOr will it?\nThe crypto industry has been shifting dramatically since New York, another U.S. state of outsized importance, passed a BitLicense bill in 2015 that has set a precedent for state-level, crypto rules and led to New York Attorney General\u2019s probe into Tether and a settlement.\nCalifornia dreamin\u2019\nAlthough federal legislative interest remains in stablecoins, a first iteration of the STABLE Act, which would provide rules for stablecoin issuers, died in the halls of power. But the passing of California\u2019s Digital Assets Law threatens to fundamentally change the stablecoin environment.\nThe law, passed almost unanimously last month by California\u2019s state assembly, would prohibit California-licensed entities from dealing with stablecoins, unless that stablecoin is fully backed by securities and issued by a bank or is licensed by the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation.\nBut one of the minds behind the STABLE Act, is skeptical about how much meaningful difference this law will make.\n\u201cI feel like this is a state-level thing dealing with a federal-level problem,\u201d Rohan Grey, a legal scholar who helped draft the STABLE Act, told CoinDesk. \u201cThe fact that this is a state-level bill still creates some limitations. They do not have the capacity to, for example, require FDIC insurance.\u201d\nThe reliance on full asset backing of stablecoins is not necessarily going to be as safe as deposit insurance, Grey says.\nGrey highlights how California\u2019s bill is actually a step back from what was before Congress as it gives an option for stablecoin issuance from entities that aren\u2019t banks \u2013 whereas the STABLE Act specifically requires chartered banks to play a role.\n\u201cWe are trying to actually make sure that that bank perimeter is strongly enforced, whereas this allows someone to be potentially licensed as a stablecoin issuer without being classified as a bank,\u201d Grey said. \u201cOne of the not as widely reported but second order and subtle goals of that was to re-absorb the money transmitter industry into banks.\u201d\nWhile tether (USDT), given its market cap, is often at the forefront of legislation around stablecoins, and as a result creates a stark divide between exchanges that can and can\u2019t offer tether (see: Binance/FTX.us versus their mothership), Grey thinks that it\u2019s important to look beyond bad actors and consider broader market safety.\n\u201cFor the people [the] behind STABLE Act, this is not a problem about individual bad actors; this is a problem about actually the structure of the market and the structure of the theory of safety,\u201d he said. \u201cIf your theory of safety is, \u2018We'll always have some assets on hand. That will be good enough,\u2019 then you're leaving out operational risk. You can be hacked. Something could go wrong. You're not covering that.\u201d\nCrypto moves faster than legislators\nEven if California Gov. Newsom signs the bill into law this week, it won\u2019t come into effect until 2025 based on the bill\u2019s wording.\n\u201cThis is highly likely to be way outdated and possibly inapplicable by the time we get to 2025,\u201d Chris Lavigne, co-chair of the digital assets group at New York-based law firm Withers, told CoinDesk. \u201cBy 2025, I suspect the regulatory regime will have dramatically changed, and so I don't know to what extent this bill will become outdated and the laws in it will become outdated.\u201d\nLavigne, like Grey, also takes issue with California doing something that\u2019s more logical for the federal government to handle.\n\u201cThis notion that they're going to prohibit California-licensed entities dealing with stablecoins unless it's issued by a bank licensed by California is a wildly aggressive position,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would prohibit effectively most exchanges from either operating in California or the companies would have to cordon off their geofence people in California and not offer some of the digital assets that are on their exchanges, for example, in California.\u201d\nA bill that may ripple widely\nDespite Asia\u2019s large growing pools of liquidity, the U.S. remains the most important market for digital assets. At the end of the day, this complicates things much like how exchanges and protocols without meaningful exposure to the U.S. must be cognizant of New York\u2019s rules, especially as these rules are more stringent.\n\u201cThis creates a situation where California is trying to create some sort of standalone regime where in order to play ball in the United States, you have to first satisfy California regulators,\u201d Lavigne said.\nBut who knows where we\u2019ll be in 2025. Maybe by then, bitcoin will have gone down to $0.\nFuture Proof Festival (Huntington Beach, Calif.)\nNearcon (Lisbon)\nIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of \"First Mover\" on CoinDesk TV:\nBitcoin Drops as August CPI Shows Inflation at 8.3%\nThe August consumer price index (CPI) was released, showing inflation at 8.3% over the past year, which was higher than expected considering that gas prices declined.

To date in 2022, B2Gold has completed approximately 116,000 m of combined diamond, reverse circulation and aircore drilling on targets near the Fekola Mine and the Anaconda Area. In addition, approximately 9,000 m of drilling has been completed to date on the newly acquired Bakolobi permit.\nClick here to view Figure 1. Fekola Complex Overview\nAnaconda Area Exploration\nMamba Zone\nOngoing exploration in the Anaconda Area continues to generate positive drill results in both saprolite and sulphide domains and demonstrates upside potential to the updated Anaconda Area Mineral Resource estimate, constrained within a conceptual pit shell at a gold price of $1,800 per ounce, which included an initial Indicated Mineral Resource estimate of 32,400,000 tonnes at 1.08 g/t gold for a total 1,130,000 ounces of gold, and an Inferred Mineral Resource estimate of 63,700,000 tonnes at 1.12 g/t gold for 2,280,000 ounces of gold.\nDrilling targeting the deeper portions of the Mamba Main sulphide shoot has been particularly successful, as demonstrated by the results of holes BND_108, BND_101, and BND_104, confirming the continuity of the high grade sulphide mineralization and extending the Mamba Main sulphide shoot to over 700 m down plunge. The results from holes MSD_228 and MSD_226 suggest that multiple high grade sulphide shoots may be present in the Mamba Zone.

An initial 9,000 m of aircore drilling and reverse circulation drilling has been completed since the acquisition. Drilling is focused on the southward extension of known resources in the Adder Zone and will also test the southward extension of sulphide mineralization on the Cobra Zone. The Company believes that the Bakolobi permit is a highly prospective area that has the potential to provide for the near-term addition of both saprolite and sulphide hosted gold deposits.\nB2Gold's acquisition of Oklo Resources Limited and its flagship Dandoko project, which is anticipated to be completed on September 19, 2022, will extend the footprint of B2Gold's exploration in Mali to over 1,700 km2 and add the Dandoko project's JORC 2012 compliant Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource estimate of 8.70 million tonnes at 1.88 g/t gold for 528,000 ounces of gold and an Inferred Mineral Resource estimate of 2.63 million tonnes at 1.67 g/t gold for 141,000 ounces of gold, to B2Gold's rapidly growing Mineral Resource inventory in the region. The Company believes there is strong potential to extend the mineralization at the Dandoko project. Initial drilling on the Dandoko project is expected to commence in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nAnaconda Development Update\nIn 2022, the Company budgeted $33 million for development of infrastructure for Phase I saprolite mining at the Anaconda Area, including road construction. Based on the updated Mineral Resource estimate and B2Gold's preliminary planning, the Company has demonstrated that a pit situated on the Anaconda Area could provide selective higher grade saprolite material (average grade of 2.2 g/t gold) to be trucked to and fed into the Fekola mill at a rate of 1.5 million tonnes per annum. With the anticipated closing of the acquisition of Oklo and its flagship Dandoko project on September 19, 2022, the Company is currently evaluating its options for the timing and sourcing of material on a regional basis from all deposits within the Fekola Complex area (including Fekola, Cardinal, Dandoko, Bakalobi and the Anaconda Area). This updated evaluation is expected to be completed by the end of 2022, with first saprolite production now anticipated in the second quarter of 2023. Subject to obtaining all necessary permits and completion of a final development plan, the Company intends to commence its planned Phase I infrastructure development in the fourth quarter of 2022. Trucking of selective higher grade saprolite material to the Fekola mill would increase the ore processed and annual gold production from the Fekola mill, with the potential to add an average of approximately 80,000 to 100,000 ounces of gold per year to the Fekola mill's annual production.\nBased on the updated Mineral Resource estimate and the 2022 exploration drilling results, the Company has commenced a Phase II scoping study to review the project economics of constructing a stand-alone mill near the Anaconda Area. Subject to receipt of a positive Phase II scoping study, the Company expects that the saprolite material would continue to be trucked to and fed into the Fekola mill during the construction period for the Anaconda Area stand-alone mill.\nQA/QC on Sample Collection and Assaying\nThe primary laboratories for Fekola are SGS Laboratories in Bamako, Mali and Bureau Veritas Laboratories in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire. Periodically, exploration samples will be analyzed at the Fekola Mine laboratory. At each laboratory, samples are prepared and analyzed using 50-gram fire assay with atomic absorption finish and/or gravimetric finish. Umpire assays are used to monitor lab performance monthly.\nQuality assurance and quality control procedures include the systematic insertion of blanks, standards and duplicates into the core, reverse circulation and aircore drilling sample strings. The results of the control samples are evaluated on a regular basis with batches re-analyzed and/or resubmitted as needed. All results stated in this announcement have passed B2Gold's quality assurance and quality control protocols.\nAbout B2Gold Corp.\nB2Gold is a low-cost international senior gold producer headquartered in Vancouver, Canada.

An increase in the import tax in July also reduced appetite for the precious metal in the second-biggest consumer.\n\u201cWe were very bullish on demand this year at the beginning but we have reduced our demand estimates,\u201d said Chirag Sheth, principal consultant at London-based Metals Focus Ltd. The increase in import duties had a short-term impact and inflation and erratic monsoons in many parts of the country could impact rural demand, he said.\nThe consultancy now expects demand in 2022 to be little changed from last year, slashing its earlier forecast of 7% to 8% growth, Sheth said. Rural demand accounts for about 60% of India\u2019s gold consumption and the consumer base relies mainly on agriculture and allied industries for their incomes. Patchy rains have led to lower plantings of key staples rice, some oilseeds and pulses during the ongoing summer-sown monsoon crop season.\nGold consumption surged to 800 tons last year as the easing of virus-related restrictions unleashed demand. The jump in demand and rising imports forced the government to raise the import tax on gold to reduce inflows after the country\u2019s widening trade gap pushed the rupee to a record low.\nBut the initial impact of the increase in the import tax has now been offset by a decline in international prices, said Ashish Pethe, chairman of the All India Gem and Jewellery Domestic Council.\nSpot gold prices globally have fallen about 9% this year and plunged to the lowest since 2020 last week amid expectations of more aggressive monetary tightening by the US Federal Reserve as it tries to cool inflation. That\u2019s pushed prices in India below the key 50,000 rupees per 10 grams level, which could boost demand during the festival season, Pethe said.\nMost jewelers are anticipating a pick-up in sales during the October to December quarter, the peak buying period as the purchasing and wearing of gold is considered auspicious for festivals like Diwali and the wedding season that follows. However, demand during the three-month period this year is unlikely to match last year\u2019s blockbuster sales of 343.9 tons, according to Sheth.\n(Updates with consumption details of rural buyers in the fourth paragraph)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Global Race to Hike Rates Tilts Economies Toward Recession\nBusiness Schools Are Beginning to Embrace Stakeholder Inclusion\nThe Biggest Copper Mine in the US Stalled in Dispute Over Sacred Ground\nIt\u2019s White-Collar Jobs That Are at Risk in the Next Recession\n\u00a92022 Bloomberg L.P.",

This increase resulted from a higher feed grade and more ore processed.\nQ4 FY2022 ore processed increased to 119,409 tonnes from 94,940 tonnes for Q4 FY2021. The increase is due to the impact of COVID-19 related closures in Q4 FY2021 and the operation resuming in FY2022.\nQ4 FY2022 total production costs were $0.58 million as compared to $4.82 million for Q4 FY2021. Cash cost per ounce decreased by 7% to $1,282/oz as compared to $1,386/oz of Q4 FY2021. The decrease was attributable to less waste removed, higher feed grade, more ore processed, and gold produced.\nFinancial Analysis\nQ4 FY2022 gold sales generated revenue of $0.85 million as compared to $6.08 million from Q4 FY2021. Gold sales revenue was derived from the sale of 450oz (Q4 FY2021: 2,750oz) of gold at an average realized gold price of $1,890 per ounce (Q4 FY2021: $1,812 per ounce). There was no gold prepaid delivery for Q4 FY2022 (Q4 FY2021: 723oz at $1,525 per ounce).\nQ4 FY2022 mining operations before non-cash amortization and depreciation generated a gross margin of $0.27 million, a decrease of 78% from $1.27 million in Q4 FY2021. The decrease in gross margin was attributable to the decrease in gold sold offset by a higher average realized gold price.\nCash outflow from investing activities for Q4 FY2022 was $2.25 million (Q4 FY2021: inflow of $28.44 million, which was mainly from the sale of the Mengapur project of $29.16 million and the sale of 80% interest in Tuckanarra project of $2.66 million).\nFiscal Year 2022 Results\n2022 Gold Production\nProduction Analysis\nGold production of 7,091oz, a 31% decrease as compared to 10,282oz of the previous year. Gold production for the year ended June 30, 2022 was mainly from transitional leachable sulphide ore from Selinsing Pit 4, oxide mineralized materials from Peranggih and old tailings materials. This resulted in lower mill feed grades but slightly higher recovery rates.\n2022 mining activities delivered 355,519 tonnes of ore from Selinsing (198,689 tonnes), Buffalo Reef (4,205 tonnes), and Peranggih (152,625 tonnes). Mining costs for Peranggih were recorded against inventories for 152,625 tonnes during the year, of which 147,598 tonnes were fed into the mill.\nOre processed decreased to 544,003 tonnes from 579,569 tonnes last year. The decrease was due to the lack of availability of stockpiled ore. Ore stockpile has significantly reduced mainly due to the adverse impact of the oxide materials are being depleted and in transition to flotation production, which is under construction. COVID-19 pandemic has not helped in achieving the target. The Company has devoted its effort to improve the stockpile balance.\nTotal production costs were $13.81 million as compared to $15.13 million of last year. Cash cost per ounce increased by 46% to $1,723/oz as compared to $1,178/oz of last year. The increase was attributable to a 18% decrease in the mill feed grade from 0.69g/t to 0.84g/t as a result of processing significantly more leachable sulphide ore and other low recovery ores, heavy rainfall in the mine pits, partially offset by an increase in recovery to 62.7% (2021: 60.8%).\nFinancial Analysis\nGold sales generated revenue of $14.44 million for the year as compared to $23.24 million from last year. Gold sales revenue was derived from the sale of 6,329oz (2021: 10,700oz) of gold at an average realized gold price of $1,870 per ounce (2021: $1,864 per ounce) and the delivery of 1,687oz (2021: 2,150oz) in fulfilling gold prepaid obligations at an average London Fix PM gold price of $1,545 per ounce (2021: $1,525 per ounce).\nMining operations before non-cash amortization and depreciation generated a gross margin of $0.63 million, a decrease of 92% from $8.10 million from the previous year. The decrease in gross margin was attributable to the decrease in gold sold offset by a higher average realized gold price.\nCash and cash equivalents balance as at June 30, 2022 was $21.04 million, a decrease of $17.58 million from the balance at June 30, 2021 of $38.62 million. As at June 30, 2022, the Company had positive working capital $30.33 million (June 30, 2021: $48.54 million). The decrease in working capital was mainly due to the capital expenditures spent on flotation construction project and Murchison drilling programs.\nCash outflow from investing activities for the year was $12.99 million (2021: inflow of $26.87 million, which was mainly from the sale of the Mengapur project of $29.16 million and the sale of 80% interest in Tuckanarra project of $2.66 million).\nDevelopment\nSelinsing Gold Mine\nAt Selinsing, development work focused on completion of the Phase 1 Sulphide Project development that includes flotation plant construction and mine development, aimed to produce saleable sulphide gold concentrates. The flotation plant construction includes project management, project validation, flotation design and engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning. Mine development includes upgrading of tailing storage facilities, pit push backs, river diversion, and pre-stripping.\nProcurement at Selinsing construction has delivered and installed the flotation cells, agitators, pumps, thickeners. A major delay was encountered from several long lead components which were held up at the factory and at the Shanghai international port due to Shanghai COVID-19 shutdown. Of which the gear box and bridge assemble work have been complete and shipped to the Selinsing site subsequent to the year end in September 2022. However, the delivery of the fabricated concentrate filter was further delivered for shipment and an arrival is expected in mid of November 2022. Completion of commissioning is anticipated in late November 2022.\nAt year end, 69% of the overall project had been completed with costs incurred of $10.46 million. Construction for project included: civil foundation work at the: flotation area, reagent area and concentrate thickener area. Structure steel work has been initiated and continues for the filter, water recovery thickener, water services facilities, screening and conditioning tower, flocculants plant, and the concentrate thickener areas are 75% completed. The 60% of the piping work has been completed and continues to progress. The equipment installation work for flotation cell is nearly completed, while the reagent agitator and tank installation has been completed.\nThe tailing storage facility (\u201cTSF\u201d) upgrade continued with the current capacity being adequate for production until May 2023.\nMurchison Gold Project\nAt Murchison development work focused on identifying and testing both regional exploration targets away from known mineralization, and extensions to existing resources, while continuing to assess early production opportunities.\nThe Company continues to ensure that the plant and other facilities are operationally ready through its care and maintenance program to ensure efficient commissioning in the future. Site accommodations and catering are fully functional in readiness for the Company\u2019s personnel and mining contractors when a restart is approved.\nExploration\nMalaysia\nNo significant exploration activities were conducted at Selinsing and Buffalo Reef during the fiscal year except for geological mapping exercise and grab sampling collection.\nDuring fiscal 2022, the Company continued to place grade control drilling at Peranggih, intended to locate mineable material to provide additional Selinsing mill feed. Drilling at Peranggih included 1,200m over 25 holes to a maximum depth of 70m, at 20m by 20m spacing, targeting a steeply dipping high-grade mineralized structure. Approximately 70% of holes have hit gold mineralization above an oxide cut-off (>0.35g/t Au) at less than 50m below the surface, defining a mineralized zone 830m long and 60m wide. 66 channel samples and 131 grab/float samples were compiled, which tested extensions to known mineralization at Peranggih and 76 grab/float samples at Selinsing.\nWestern Australia\nIn fiscal 2022, as part of a two-year exploration program to test the potential for additional gold discovery, the Company completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 drilling programs. The Company tested greenfield targets and extensions to known mineralized structures, and successfully achieved initial objectives with the Phase 1 Junction target discovery and the Phase 2 drilling confirmation of gold mineralization extensions at depth at the NOA group of deposits, highlighting the opportunity to grow the Murchison Project organically.\nPhase 1 drilling program included a total of 46 RC holes for 3,465m and a total of 349 AC holes were completed for 10,484m. Phase 2 drilling program included a combined 18 RC and DD holes for a total of 5,595m. The drill programs covered the Munro Bore Extension target, FLC2 and FLC3 prospects, newly discovered Junction Target and NOA group.\nThe results from the programs continue to support the Company\u2019s strategy that potentially could lead to extend the economic mineralization beyond the existing Mineral Resource and to new discoveries within the Burnakura Project area.\nAbout Monument\nMonument Mining Limited (TSX-V: MMY, FSE:D7Q1) is an established Canadian gold producer that 100% owns and operates the Selinsing Gold Mine in Malaysia and the Murchison Gold Project in the Murchison area of Western Australia. It has 20% interest in Tuckanarra Gold Project jointly owned with Odyssey Gold Ltd in the same region.

        "full_text": "Advancing Donlin Gold to Prepare the Project for the Next Phase of Development; Robust Treasury of $132 Million in Cash and Term Deposits, with $25 Million of Receivables in 2023\n-\nThe 42,334-meter drill program is wrapping-up for the year. The joint release issued by NOVAGOLD, Barrick and Donlin Gold on July 28, 2022 reported further encouraging assays, with more high-grade gold intercepts that demonstrated good grade continuity. Additional results will be issued in the coming weeks.\n-\nWith Donlin Gold\u2019s largest budget in over a decade, our focus is on the path forward, subject to Donlin Gold LLC Board approval, toward the preparation of an updated feasibility study. To this end, the drill program is providing the data for the geologic modelling and interpretation work for the updated resource model while we engage in engineering studies, as well as pursue our comprehensive environmental and community relations activities.\n-\nNOVAGOLD\u2019s strong cash position of $132 million as of August 31, 2022, with additional funds of $25 million due in July 2023 from Newmont Corporation, should be sufficient to advance Donlin Gold to a construction decision.\nVANCOUVER, British Columbia, Oct. 04, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NOVAGOLD RESOURCES INC. (\u201cNOVAGOLD\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d) (NYSE American, TSX: NG) today released its 2022 third quarter financial results and an update on its Tier One1 gold development project, Donlin Gold, which NOVAGOLD owns equally with Barrick Gold Corporation (\u201cBarrick\u201d).\nDetails of the financial results for the quarter ended August 31, 2022 are presented in the consolidated financial statements and quarterly report filed on Form 10-Q on October 4, 2022 that is available on the Company\u2019s website at www.novagold.com, on SEDAR at www.sedar.com, and on EDGAR at www.sec.gov. All amounts are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated.\nIn the third quarter 2022, the following milestones were achieved at Donlin Gold:\n-\nThe drill program wrapped-up with 141 holes and 42,334 meters completed for the year. The drilling focused on tight-spaced grid drilling and also included in-pit and ex-pit exploration. Additional assay results will be issued in the coming weeks, with the final results expected to be released by early 2023.\n-\nOn July 14, 2022, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC)\u2019s Commissioner granted the request for an adjudicatory hearing review on the State\u2019s Clean Water Act Section 401 certification of the Federal CWA Section 404 permit. The briefing process is underway, and we expect the hearing process to be completed in the next six months.\n-\nDonlin Gold worked with our dedicated community partners in Alaska and in the Yukon-Kuskokwim (Y-K) region to execute the largest drill program at Donlin since 2007, while protecting the health and safety of Donlin Gold\u2019s employees and contractors. Most of the site crew for the program have been local hires from 24 different communities in the Y-K region.\n-\nDonlin Gold continued its collaboration with Calista Corporation (\u201cCalista\u201d) and The Kuskokwim Corporation (\u201cTKC\u201d) in all aspects of outreach and engagement throughout the Y-K region in areas spanning education, health and safety, cultural traditions, and environmental initiatives, including:\n-\nCreating a subsistence committee comprised of independent regional stakeholders with varying views on development initiatives in recent years;\n-\nSigning two additional Shared Value Statements with villages in the Y-K region for a total of 11 to date (Akiak, Sleetmute, Kalskag, Napaimute, Crooked Creek, Napaskiak, Nikolai, Tuluksak, Stony River, Pilot Station, and Toksook Bay). These agreements comprise educational, environmental, and social initiatives to help support villages;\n-\nContributing to and participating in the fifth annual \u201cIn It for the Long Haul\u201d Backhaul Project to collect, remove, and safely dispose of household hazardous and electronic waste from 30 remote villages throughout the Y-K region;\n-\nPromoting and sponsoring youth education and health-focused activities in the Y-K region through \u201cAlaska EXCEL\u201d, a non-profit organization providing life-changing educational and professional opportunities for rural Alaska students and young adults, as well as the Alaska School Activities Association; and\n-\nEncouraging community well-being and cultural awareness across Alaska through the Bethel Community Services Foundation partnership and sponsorship of the Alaska Native Heritage Center.\n-\n-\nCalista and Donlin Gold continued their proactive, bipartisan outreach in Alaska and Washington, D.C. to highlight the thoroughness of the project\u2019s environmental review and permitting processes, as well as the benefits that the project would deliver to Native Alaskans.\n________________\n1 NOVAGOLD defines a Tier One gold development project as one with a projected production life of at least 10 years, annual projected production of at least 500,000 ounces of gold, and average projected cash costs over the production life that are in the lower half of the industry cost curve.\nPresident\u2019s Message\nDonlin Gold\u2019s Outstanding Drill Results and Engagement Activities Lay a Solid Foundation for the Path Forward\nThe NOVAGOLD management team\u2019s commitment to the Donlin Gold project has been unwavering for more than 10 years because we \u2014 and all our stakeholders \u2014 recognize the unique potential of this future operation. The extensive and cumulative work invested in the Donlin Gold project has substantially enhanced its value to Alaskans as well as our shareholders. It has also consistently validated the attractiveness of continuing to responsibly advance this excellent gold asset up the value chain. This year alone, the combination of an ambitious drill program with our geological modelling and interpretation work for the updated resource model, engineering studies, environmental activities, and vast community relations and government affairs efforts with our Native Corporation partners, Calista and TKC, have all contributed toward multiple achievements to date.\nWe refer to Donlin as \u201cthe gift that keeps on giving\u201d. Unsurprisingly, therefore, we continue to be most encouraged by the outstanding drill results of the ACMA and Lewis pits. The assay results released to date have returned significant high-grade intercepts and demonstrated good grade continuity. They shall further inform and support the global resource estimate, recent modelling concepts, and strategic mine planning work. Examples of high-grade drill-hole intercepts include DC22-2040 that intersected 52.27 m grading 14.63 g/t gold; drill-hole DC22-2040 that intersected 18.65 m grading 10.78 g/t gold; and drill-hole DC22-2056 that intersected 73.98 m grading 4.21 g/t gold. For a more extensive description of recent drill results, please refer to the joint release from NOVAGOLD, Barrick and Donlin Gold dated July 28, 2022.\nWith the receipt of these excellent results, the Donlin Gold LLC Board approved an increase in the 2022 drill program in the third quarter from 34,000 meters to 42,000 meters. The drilling at site recently wrapped-up with a total of 141 holes, which included an additional 43 holes and some 8,000 meters more than the original 2022 planned work. To date, the Donlin Gold project reported assay results for approximately 9,870 meters of the 2022 drilling program with additional assays expected to be released in the coming weeks and the final results by early 2023. The drill program included tight spaced grid drilling in structural domains, in-pit and below-pit exploration in sparsely drilled areas, platform mapping to further confirm mineralization continuity and key geological controls in representative areas of the deposit, waste rock facility condemnation drilling, and 14 geotechnical drill holes for the Alaska Dam Safety certificates. With this additional drilling, the Donlin Gold 2022 expenditures are now anticipated to stand at $64 million (of which NOVAGOLD\u2019s portion is 50%). The budget also supports the advancement of numerous environmental activities, and finances community and external affairs efforts.\nThe success of our drill program in the third quarter \u2014 and for the first nine months of the year \u2014 is due to the exceptional dedication of the Donlin Gold team in Anchorage and at site, the majority of which are local hires from 24 different communities in the Y-K region, who all share the goal of protecting the health and safety of their colleagues. That goal, both at NOVAGOLD and at Donlin Gold, is indeed our top priority.\nAs part of Donlin Gold\u2019s largest budget in over a decade, efforts in 2022 have focused on drilling to wrap-up the geologic modelling and interpretation work for an updated resource model, updating and advancing engineering studies, and continuing our extensive environmental and community relations activities, as together we determine the path forward toward an updated feasibility study, subject to a formal approval by the Donlin Gold LLC Board.\nA Federally Permitted Project on Private Land with Excellent and Longstanding Native Corporation Partnerships\nPermitting in Alaska has represented a substantial undertaking over several years \u2014 and in fact a tremendous achievement \u2014 to ensure a diligent, thorough, transparent, and inclusive process for all involved, including stakeholders from the Y-K region. Donlin Gold, working closely with its Native Corporation partners, provides support to the State of Alaska as authorities advance various permits and certificates required for the project.\nFor instance, Donlin Gold continues to support the ADEC in its efforts regarding the State\u2019s Clean Water Act (CWA) Section 401 certification (the \u201c401 Certification\u201d) of the Federal CWA Section 404 permit. On July 14, 2022, the ADEC Commissioner granted the request for an adjudicatory hearing review related to potential water temperature effects in Crooked Creek. The briefing process is underway, and we expect the hearing process to be completed in the next six months.\nThe inherent value of having a federally permitted project on private land designated by law for mining should not be overlooked. As with all mining projects in the developed world, we have always prepared and organized ourselves for challenges. Our management team is intimately familiar with the processes that need to be followed. Donlin Gold and its owners, alongside the steadfast advocacy of Calista and TKC, shall continue to support the State in its defense of what constitutes an exceptionally thorough and diligent permitting process.\nIt should also be noted that all appeals challenging Donlin Gold permits to date have been unsuccessful, often multiple times. And we have confidence in the process. Nevertheless, objecting to mining happens to be a business in itself. On September 20, 2021, the Alaska Department of Natural Resources\u2019 (ADNR) issuance of the Right-of-Way (ROW) lease for the portions of the natural gas pipeline on State lands was separately appealed in Alaska Superior Court by two parties: (1) Earthjustice representing Orutsararmiut Native Council (ONC), the native villages of Eek, Chevak, and Kwigillingok, and Cook InletKeeper; and (2) Robert Fithian, an adventure business owner who operates near the ROW. The two appeals have now been consolidated into a single case that is pending before the Alaska Superior Court based in Anchorage, Alaska. Legal briefings are being prepared by the parties and we anticipate a decision on both appeals in 2023.\nIn 2021, the State of Alaska\u2019s issuance of water rights for the mine and transportation facilities was appealed to the Commissioner of the ADNR. On April 25, 2022, the ADNR Commissioner denied the appeal; however, Earthjustice, ONC and five villages appealed the Commissioner\u2019s decision in Alaska Superior Court on May 25, 2022. ADNR filed the Administrative Record with the Court on September 12, 2022, and the appellants are preparing their initial brief. A decision is expected in 2023.\nDonlin Gold applied for a new air quality permit from ADEC, which is expected to be in place when the current permit expires in mid-2023. The Donlin Gold air quality permit renewal is required in order to ascertain that emissions controls reflect best technology and to re-confirm that air quality standards will be met. A draft permit is expected to be issued for public comment by the end of 2022. Donlin Gold is also preparing an updated Alaska Pollutant Discharge Elimination System application for a regularly scheduled renewal by ADEC, for which we anticipate a decision by mid-2023. Furthermore, Donlin Gold is working with Calista, TKC, ADNR, and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management on re-locating easements and public ROWs in the project area. ADNR issued the proposed re-location plan for public comment in the summer of 2022 and a final decision is expected to be announced by the end of the year. Lastly, the field work related to the issuance of the Alaska Dam Safety certificates resumed during the third quarter of 2022.\nExtensive Engagement in Partnership with Regional Stakeholders\u2026 With Consistent, Long-Term Support from Alaska\u2019s U.S. Senators for the Donlin Gold Project\nDonlin Gold is enormously fortunate to enjoy time-tested partnerships with Calista and TKC, owners of the mineral and surface rights, respectively. Donlin Gold\u2019s location on private land specially designated for mining activities following the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) represents a key differentiating factor from most other mining assets in Alaska. We deeply appreciate the critical value of having engaged Native Corporation partners and meaningful Tribal input that provide valuable insight about their land and support efforts for responsible and sustainable economic development through every phase of the Donlin Gold project.\nDonlin Gold continues to work with Calista and TKC in all aspects of outreach and engagement throughout the Y-K region in the areas of education, health and safety, cultural traditions, and environmental initiatives, including creating a subsistence committee comprised of independent regional stakeholders reflecting diverse views on development initiatives, among other activities.\nIn the third quarter, Donlin Gold and NOVAGOLD contributed to and participated in the Backhaul Project \u2013 \u201cIn It for the Long Haul\u201d. This was the fifth annual backhaul project to collect, remove, and safely dispose of household hazardous and electronic waste from 30 remote villages throughout the Y-K region. Over the past five years, nearly 400,000 lbs. of waste was removed that would otherwise have ended up in landfills and waterways. Sustained efforts are also underway to promote youth education and healthy activities in the Y-K region through programs such as Alaska EXCEL, which provides life-changing educational and professional opportunities for rural Alaska students and young adults, and the Alaska School Activities Association. Other important initiatives that took place during the third quarter included sponsoring the Alaska Native Heritage Center which encourages cultural awareness across Alaska and our partnership with the Bethel Community Services Foundation which is dedicated to the development, growth, continuance and enhancement of community-based programs and services.\nIn the third quarter, Donlin Gold signed two additional Shared Value Statements with villages in the Y-K region for a total of 11 (Akiak, Sleetmute, Napaimute, Crooked Creek, Napaskiak, Nikolai, Tuluksak, Upper Kalskag, Stony River, Pilot Station, and Toksook Bay). These agreements formalize current engagement with key local communities, expand upon the long-term relationships already established with them, and address specific community needs including: water, sewer, and solid waste projects; the ice road that connects remote villages in the Y-K region; salmon and other aquatic life studies; and suicide and public safety prevention programs.\nCalista and Donlin Gold also continued their proactive, bipartisan outreach in Alaska and Washington, D.C. to highlight the thoroughness of the project\u2019s environmental review and permitting processes, in addition to the considerable benefits that the project would deliver to Native Alaskans. As a result, Alaska\u2019s U.S. Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan have consistently expressed their long-term support of the Donlin Gold project.\nA World-Class Asset in the Right Part of the World\u2026 With Sustainable Longevity and Exceptional Exploration Potential\nDonlin Gold merits all of the attention it receives because of its unique principal attributes. These include first and foremost the project\u2019s enormous mineral endowment and scale, with approximately 39 million ounces in Measured and Indicated Resources, inclusive of Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves. Such reserves provide Donlin Gold with among the largest \u201cin production capability\u201d in the gold industry, with a mine life of at least 27 years \u2014 and with an exceptionally high grade at 2.24 grams per tonne2, or twice the industry average for an open-pit project3. This advantage, in turn, enables Donlin Gold to be predicted to constitute one of the lowest cost producers in the gold space. The great exploration potential is another exceptionally attractive attribute, whereby the open-pit resource outline encompasses only three kilometers of an eight-kilometer mineralized belt \u2014 which itself represents less than 5% of the total land package.\nFor all these reasons and more, we believe that Donlin Gold stands in a league of its own as a premier gold deposit. Once developed, the project has the potential to form a major source of responsible economic development for the Y-K region for decades to come. Meanwhile, Alaska, as the second largest gold-producing State in the United States with a well-established tradition of responsible mining, provides undeniable sustainable longevity for an operation like Donlin Gold.\n\u201cThe Tortoise and the Hare\u201d\u2026 And a Comfortable Treasury to Advance Donlin Gold to Win the Race\nAs stewards of the capital that we were entrusted with over a decade ago, the leadership of NOVAGOLD has diligently advanced the Donlin Gold project in a highly responsible manner, all the while keeping promises that were made to shareholders in 2012. Guided by a highly experienced management team with a strong track record of execution, we have focused on reducing risks while enhancing the value of the Company. With $132 million in cash and term deposits as of August 31, 2022, a further $25 million due in July 2023 from Newmont Corporation, and an additional payment of $75 million contingent upon the owners of Galore Creek making a construction decision, it is our informed opinion that we have sufficient financial resources to advance Donlin Gold activities up to a construction decision.\nPatience constitutes a uniquely consequential virtue in our space \u2014 a reality which we have demonstrated time and again over the last decade. Armed with a strong conviction, a healthy treasury, and the depth of expertise required to de-risk and further advance the project, we have positioned Donlin Gold optimally for the future. We call it \u201cthe tortoise and the hare\u201d strategy.\nNOVAGOLD defines what we consider to be the hallmark of a great natural resource investment, as stated on many occasions by our Chairman and largest shareholder Dr. Thomas S. Kaplan. A seasoned investor with over three decades of experience in the space, his investment thesis centers on establishing a stake in \u201cgreat assets that provide enormous leverage to an underlying theme\u2026and that are located in a safe jurisdiction that will allow one to keep the fruits of that leverage\u201d. In light of its many outstanding and differentiating attributes, Donlin Gold seems tailor-made to fill a real vacuum of high-quality projects in the gold industry\u2019s pipeline.\nOur efforts simply would not be as successful without the unwavering support of our esteemed shareholders, and that of our longstanding stakeholders Calista and TKC. We thank each and every one of them for their steadfastness in working so constructively with the Donlin Gold team, for an excellent drill season, and for the team\u2019s commitment to safely executing their 2022 drill program objectives and community-focused activities. Our appreciation also extends to the State government agencies and representatives that have been advancing permitting efforts with great transparency and professionalism. I am personally grateful for our employees\u2019 loyalty and for the way in which they have gone above and beyond to advance our strategy and support our stakeholders and partners, as well as for our Board\u2019s strategic guidance and high standard of conduct.\nWe remain ever so obliged to those who choose to invest in our Company, as well as for their continued interest and engagement. As a shareholder myself, I take that responsibility very seriously and, with the support of our management team, we will continue to work diligently to further advance the Company and the Donlin Gold project.\nSincerely,\nGregory A. Lang\nPresident & CEO\n________________\n2 Donlin Gold data as per the 2021 Technical Report and S-K 1300 Report (both as defined herein).

The increase in cash used in the third quarter of 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to the expanded Donlin Gold work program in 2022. In July 2021, we received proceeds of $75 million on the Newmont notes.\nIn the first nine months of 2022 cash and cash equivalents decreased by $29.2 million primarily to fund our share of Donlin Gold, for corporate administrative expenses, and for withholding taxes on share-based payments, partially offset by a net $8 million received from term deposits. The increase in Net cash used in operating activities during the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to the timing of corporate liability insurance payments. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2022 due to the expanded Donlin Gold work program, partially offset by a net increase in net proceeds received from term deposits. In 2021, we received proceeds of $75 million on the Newmont notes. Net cash used in financing activities increased in 2022 due to higher withholding tax on share-based compensation (no cash was used for CEO and CFO withholdings in 2021).\nAt the end of the third quarter, cash and term deposits were $132 million (cash $62 million, term deposits $70 million). An additional payment from Newmont of $25 million comes due in 2023 related to the sale of NOVAGOLD\u2019s 50% interest in the Galore Creek project in 2018, along with a note receivable for $75 million contingent upon approval of a Galore Creek project construction plan by the owner(s). At present, we believe we have sufficient working capital available to cover anticipated funding of the Donlin Gold project and corporate general and administrative costs until a decision to commence engineering and construction is reached by the Donlin Gold LLC Board for the Donlin Gold project, at which point substantial additional capital will be required.\n2022 Outlook\nWe anticipate spending approximately $48 million in 2022, which includes $13 million for corporate general and administrative costs; $3 million for withholding taxes on PSUs and other working capital; and $32 million to fund our share of expenditures at the Donlin Gold project, including:\n-\n$19 million for the 2022 drill program (approximately 42,000 meters of core drilling)\n-\nGrid drilling (mineralization continuity and geologic structural controls in three areas of the deposit)\n-\nIn-pit and ex-pit exploration\n-\nPlatform mapping to confirm mineralization continuity and key geological controls in representative areas of the deposit\n-\n-\n$9 million for external affairs, permitting, environmental, land and legal activities, and\n-\n$4 million for project planning and fieldwork (dam and water structures, metallurgical testing, mining studies, hydrogeology and geochemistry, and infrastructure planning).\nNOVAGOLD\u2019s primary goals in 2022 are to continue to advance the Donlin Gold project toward a construction decision; maintain or increase support for Donlin Gold among the project\u2019s stakeholders; promote a strong safety, sustainability, and environmental culture; maintain a peer-leading reputation for NOVAGOLD, its governance practices and its project among shareholders; and manage the Company treasury effectively and efficiently. Our operations primarily relate to the delivery of project milestones, including the achievement of various technical, environmental, sustainable development, economic and legal objectives, obtaining necessary permits, commencement of feasibility studies, preparation of engineering designs and the financing to fund these objectives.\nConference Call & Webcast Details\nNOVAGOLD\u2019s conference call and webcast to discuss these results will take place on October 5, 2022, at 8:00 am PT (11:00 am ET).

With approximately 39 million ounces of gold in the Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource categories, inclusive of Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves (541 million tonnes at an average grade of approximately 2.24 grams per tonne in the Measured and Indicated Resource categories on a 100% basis),4 Donlin Gold is regarded to be one of the largest, highest-grade, and most prospective known open-pit gold deposits in the world.\nAccording to the 2021 Technical Report and the S-K 1300 Report, once in production, Donlin Gold is expected to produce an average of more than one million ounces per year over a 27-year mine life on a 100% basis. The Donlin Gold project has substantial exploration potential beyond the designed footprint which currently covers three kilometers of an approximately eight-kilometer-long gold-bearing trend. Current activities at Donlin Gold are focused on State permitting, optimization work, community outreach, and workforce development in preparation for the eventual construction and operation of this project. With a strong balance sheet, NOVAGOLD is well-positioned to fund its share of permitting and optimization advancement efforts at the Donlin Gold project.\nScientific and Technical Information\nCertain scientific and technical information contained herein with respect to the Donlin Gold project is derived from the 2021 Technical Report and the S-K 1300 Report5.

Wood prepared the S-K 1300 Report.\nPaul Chilson, P.E., who is the Manager, Mine Engineering for NOVAGOLD and a Qualified Person under NI 43-101, has approved and verified the scientific and technical information related to the 2022 Donlin Gold project drill program, the 2021 Technical Report and the S-K 1300 Report contained in this media release.\n________________\n4 Donlin Gold data as per the 2021 Technical Report and the S-K 1300 Report, refer to footnote 2 for the description.\n5 The Company retained Wood Canada Limited (\u201cWood\u201d) in 2021 to update content in its previously filed \u201cDonlin Creek Gold Project, Alaska, USA, NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Second Updated Feasibility Study,\u201d effective November 18, 2011, and amended January 20, 2012. This update resulted in a report titled \u201cNI 43-101 Technical Report on the Donlin Gold Project, Alaska, USA\u201d with an effective date of June 1, 2021 (the \u201c2021 Technical Report\u201d) and was filed on August 31, 2021. The Company is a registrant with the SEC and is reporting its exploration results, Mineral Resources, and Mineral Reserves in accordance with Subpart 229.1300 of Regulation S-K \u2013 Disclosure by Registrants Engaged in Mining Operations (\u201cS-K 1300\u201d) as of November 30, 2021. While the S-K 1300 rules are similar to National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects rules in Canada, they are not identical and therefore two reports have been produced for the Donlin Gold project. The Company requested that Wood prepare a Technical Report Summary of the Donlin Gold project, Alaska, USA using the standards of S-K 1300 and it is titled \u201cS-K 1300 Technical Report Summary on the Donlin Gold Project, Alaska, USA\u201d (\u201cS-K 1300 Report\u201d), current as of November 30, 2021. Wood incorporated 2020 costs and new gold price guidance to meet the Company\u2019s reporting requirements. The resultant 2021 Technical Report and S-K 1300 Report showed no material change to the previously reported mineral resources or mineral reserves.\nNOVAGOLD Contacts:\nM\u00e9lanie Hennessey\nVice President, Corporate Communications\n604-669-6227 or 1-866-669-6227\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis media release includes certain \u201cforward-looking information\u201d and \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d (collectively \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d) within the meaning of applicable securities legislation, including the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Matup\u00e1 will be an open pit gold mine and is situated in the Alta Floresta Gold Province, a prolific region with large companies operating and exploring in the area, such as Anglo American, Codelco, Nexa Resources, IAMGOLD and Yamana Gold. The technical report (the \u201cTechnical Report\u201d) titled \u201cFeasibility Study for the Matup\u00e1 Gold Project, Matup\u00e1 Municipality, Mato Grosso, Brazil\u201d, prepared by Aura will be filed within 45 days of this press release.\nHighlights:\nAfter-tax total investment estimated at approximately US$107 million.\nAfter-tax net present value (\u201cNPV\u201d) of US$96 million when using the weighted average consensus gold prices for the projected period of US$1,664 per ounce.\nAverage annual gold production is estimated at 54,779 ounces from years 1 to 4, with an estimated life of mine (\u201cLOM\u201d) of 7 years, based on mineral reserves estimated in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 \u2013 Standards for Disclosure for Minerals Projects (\u201cNI 43-101\u201d).\nMatup\u00e1 Gold Project Feasibility Study includes updated mineral resource and reserve estimates for the X1 deposit comprising Proven and Probable Reserves of 309,150 ounces gold.\nPotential remains to expand LOM with two additional deposits being drilled with high-grade results.\nRodrigo Barbosa, President and CEO of Aura, commented, \u201cWith the completion of the Feasibility Study, we are another step closer to reaching our total production goal of over 400,000 GEO1 from all of our projects. Matup\u00e1\u2019s X1 deposit has 309 koz in Proven and Probable Reserves, which generates 49.9%2 of leveraged return to our shareholders. It also has compelling economics with all-in sustaining costs at $710/oz between years 1 to 4; the project is in line with our strategic goal to generate cashflows while expanding our mineral footprint. More importantly, while we advance X1, we continue to drill in nearby areas with high geological potential including follow up drilling at Serrinhas, where we hit 81 meters at 3.89 g/t Au and additional 59 meters with 3.14 g/t Au. Our strategy is to move to construction as soon as possible with the highest ESG (Environmental Social Governance) standards, while we continue to uncover the exploration potential property wide.\u201d\n1 Annually. 2 Considering 50% of leverage and $1,664 gold price.\nMatup\u00e1 Gold Project\nThe Project encompasses an area surrounding the municipalities of Matup\u00e1 and Guarant\u00e3 do Norte, approximately 700 km north of Cuiab\u00e1, the Mato Grosso State capital, and 200 km north of Sinop, an important commercial center and fourth largest city in the state in terms of total population.\nAura acquired the Project in 2018 as a result of the merger with Rio Novo Gold Inc., and restarted exploration activities in 2019. The Project was owned by Vale from 1999 to 2006, and in 2003, the X1 anomalous area was discovered through initial diamond core drilling.\nThe Company has increased its mineral rights position in 2020 and 2021 from 28,674 hectares to 62,506 hectares, holding the mineral rights for nine properties, of which three of those cover an area of 15,000 hectares located within the existing mining concession (X1, Guarant\u00e3 Ridge and Serrinhas deposits). Another six properties totaling 47,000 hectares are under Exploration Permit, all in the prolific Juruena-Teles Pires Gold Province, where many gold deposits and occurrences exist.\nThe Company believes Matup\u00e1 has the potential to increase mineral resources and mineral reserves in certain areas within its existing permits with additional exploration activities. Such potential increases have not been incorporated in the Feasibility Study.\nSummary of Key Results for the Matup\u00e1 Feasibility Study\nMATUP\u00c1 GOLD PROJECT*\nYears 1-4\nLife of Mine (7 years)\nAverage Plant Feed Grade (g Au/t)\n1.36\n1.19\nAverage Annual Gold Production (koz)\n55\n42\nAverage Recovery (%)\n95.1\n94.7\nTotal Payable Gold (koz)\n219\n293\nCash Costs (US$/oz)\n529\n592\nAISC (US$/oz)\n710\n762\nStrip Ratio (waste:ore)\n1.83\n1.73\n* All Values except feed grade and strip ratio are rounded\nFinancial Key Performance Indicators (\u201cKPIs\u201d) expected for the Project\nMain assumptions:\nGold price: US$ 1,664/oz (Average \u2013 7 years)\nExchange average rate (BRL / USD): R$ 5.19:US$1.00\nDiscount rate: 5%\nGold prices (US$/oz)\n1,200\n1,664\n1,900\nAfter-tax Project Capex\nUS$ million\n107.1\n107.1\n107.1\nAfter-tax NPV\nUS$ million\n4.6\n96.1\n140.3\nAfter-tax simple payback (after Start-Up)\nyears\n5.1\n2.3\n1.9\nAfter-tax IRR\n% p.a.\n6.2%\n27.5%\n35.7%\nPre-tax Project Capex\nUS$ million\n101.3\n101.3\n101.3\nPre-tax NPV\nUS$ million\n10.7\n115.6\n167.4\nPre-tax simple payback (after Start-Up)\nyears\n4.0\n2.0\n1.7\nPre-tax IRR\n% p.a.\n7.9%\n31.8%\n41.0%\nResults above are shown assuming that the project is financed with 100% equity, in compliance with NI 43-101.

Serrinhas property is a 10-kilometer-long mineralized zone, with 10 different exploration targets. In terms of comparison, X1 deposit is a 350-meter-long, single target.\nOn Serrinhas property, the company has drilled 20 DDH in 2021 totaling 4,740m, and has drilled already 52 DDH in 2022 totaling 11,523m as of the date of this press release. Aura\u2019s objective is to continue the environmental licensing during 2022-2023. In parallel, Aura is investing to increase resources and reserves at the Matup\u00e1 Gold with the exploration program.\nQualified Persons\nHomero Delboni, Jr. Ph.D., MAusIMM \u2013 CP Metallurgy, (Independent Consultant), Farshid Ghazanfari, P.Geo., Geology and Mineral Resources Director for Aura Minerals Inc, and Luiz Pignatari, P.Eng. Principal Mining Engineer at EDEM Consultants, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil are qualified persons as defined by NI 43-101 and prepared or supervised the preparation of the information that forms the basis for the scientific and technical contents of this press release.\nMr. Ghazanfari has reviewed the sampling and QA/QC procedures and results thereof as verification of the sampling data disclosed above and approved the information contained in this news release.\nQPs are not aware of any any known political, legal, political, environmental or other risks that could materially affect development.\nQuality Assurance and Quality Control\nAnalytical work was carried out by SGS Lab, Geosol Laboratory in Vespasiano, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Drill core samples were crushed, pulverized and homogenized at SGS Geosol laboratory in Goi\u00e2nia, Goias, Brazil, then pulp samples were shipped to SGS Lab in Vespasiano. All samples were analyzed for gold values determined by fire assay method (code FAA505) with atomic absorption spectrometry finish on 50g aliquots. SGS has routine quality control procedures which ensure that every batch of 20 prepared samples includes one sample repeat, three commercial standards, and blanks. SGS QA/QC measures are independent of Aura. Aura established a standard QA/QC procedure for the drilling programs at Serrinhas by inserting one blank, one standard, and one duplicate for every 40 samples.\nRisks relating to Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve Estimates\nThe figures for mineral resources and mineral reserves contained herein are estimates only and no assurance can be given that the anticipated tonnages and grades will be achieved, that the indicated level of recovery will be realized or that the mineral resources and mineral reserves can be mined or processed profitably. Actual reserves, if any, may not conform to geological, metallurgical or other expectations, and the volume and grade of material recovered may be below the estimated levels. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating mineral resources and mineral reserves, including many factors beyond the Company\u2019s control. Such estimation is a subjective process, and the accuracy of any mineral reserve or mineral resource estimate is a function of the quantity and quality of available data and of the assumptions made and judgments used in engineering and geological interpretation. Short-term operating factors relating to the mineral resources and mineral reserves, such as the need for orderly development of the ore bodies or the processing of new or different ore grades, may cause the mining operation to be unprofitable in any particular accounting period. In addition, there can be no assurance that metal recoveries in small scale laboratory tests will be duplicated in larger scale tests under on-site conditions or during production. Lower market prices, increased production costs, the presence of deleterious elements, reduced recovery rates and other factors may result in revision of the mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates from time to time or may render the Company\u2019s mineral resources and mineral reserves uneconomic to exploit. Mineral resource and mineral reserve data is not indicative of future results of operations. If the Company\u2019s actual mineral resources and mineral reserves are less than current estimates or if the Company fails to develop its resource base through the realization of identified mineralized potential, its results of operations or financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nAbout Aura 360\u00b0 Mining\nAura is focused on mining in complete terms \u2013 thinking holistically about how its business impacts and benefits every one of our stakeholders: our company, our shareholders, our employees, and the countries and communities we serve. We call this 360\u00b0 Mining.\nAura is a mid-tier gold and copper production company focused on the development and operation of gold and base metal projects in the Americas. The Company\u2019s producing assets include the San Andres gold mine in Honduras, the Ernesto/Pau-a -Pique gold mine in Brazil and the Aranzazu copper-gold-silver mine in Mexico.

It\u2019s going from west to east now,\u201d said Joseph Stefans, head of trading at MKS PAMP SA, a gold refining and trading firm. \u201cWe are trying to keep up as best we can.\u201d\nThe rotation of metal around the world is part of a gold-market cycle that has repeated for decades: when investors retreat and prices drop, Asian buying picks up and precious metals flow east \u2014 helping to put a floor on the gold price during times of weakness.\nThen, when gold eventually rallies again, much of it returns to sit in bank vaults beneath the streets of New York, London and Zurich.\nSince peaking in March, gold prices have tumbled 18% as the Federal Reserve\u2019s aggressive rate hikes caused mass liquidation by financial investors.\nMore than 527 tons of gold has poured out of New York and London vaults that back the two biggest Western markets since the end of April, according to data from the CME Group Inc. and London Bullion Market Association.\nAt the same time, shipments are rising into big Asian gold consumers like China, whose imports hit a four-year high in August.\nWhile plenty of gold is heading east, it\u2019s still not enough to meet demand. Gold in Dubai and Istanbul or on the Shanghai Gold Exchange has traded at multi-year premiums to the London benchmark in recent weeks, according to MKS PAMP \u2014 a sign that buying is outstripping imports.\nRead: China Gold Prices Surge to Huge Premium as Demand Swamps Imports\n\u201cDemand typically picks up when prices fall,\u201d said Philip Klapwijk, managing director of Hong Kong-based consultant Precious Metals Insights Ltd. \u201cBuyers want to source metal at the lower price and in the local physical market in question there may not be sufficient metal available when the price falls, so the local premium increases.\u201d\nGold in Thailand is also trading at a premium to London prices, due to a lack of supply and weakness in the local currency, according to Jitti Tangsithpakdi, the president of Thailand\u2019s Gold Traders Association.\nIn India, it is silver that is seeing big premiums. The differential has soared recently to $1, more than triple the usual level, according to consultancy Metals Focus Ltd.\n\u201cRight now the demand for silver is huge as traders restock,\u201d said Chirag Sheth, the firm\u2019s principal consultant in Mumbai. \u201cPremiums could remain elevated during the festival season that concludes with Diwali.\u201d\nAnalysts say that much of the precious metals feeding Asia\u2019s appetite is coming out of vaults run by CME Group, which back the Comex futures market in New York.\nMarket dislocations early in the pandemic drove a massive surge in prices there, forcing banks to build large stockpiles to cover their futures positions. In recent months gold has traded at a discount on the Comex compared to London, and those inventories are now being drawn down to meet Asian demand.\nHowever, it can be slow going, partly because Asian buyers tend to prefer one-kilogram bars over larger sizes. To fill a standard shipment box of 25 kg of gold, physical traders must take delivery of multiple Comex gold futures, often backed by bullion in different warehouses.\nTraders say they are facing other logistical challenges as well, which are contributing to the high Asian premiums.\n\u201cGetting stuff on boats or on planes is a bit harder than it used to be,\u201d said MKS PAMP\u2019s Stefans. \u201cIt\u2019s really just a classic example of demand far out-pacing supply.\u201d\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHackers Target Eager Homebuyers With a Dumb Scam That Keeps Working\nEven After $100 Billion, Self-Driving Cars Are Going Nowhere\n\u00a92022 Bloomberg L.P.",

Underground development of high-grade stopes progressed well during the quarter.\nTurkiye\nThird quarter gold production at Kisladag increased 27% and 35% over the first and second quarter, respectively. The increase in gold production quarter-over-quarter was driven by an increase in tonnes placed on the pad during the second quarter. As evidenced by the production results, the on-belt agglomeration continues to perform as expected. As part of the North heap leach pad project, larger conveyors will be installed on schedule in the fourth quarter, providing further improvement in materials handling capabilities in the belt agglomeration circuit and throughput rates. As a result, Eldorado continues to anticipate production at Kisladag to be weighted to the second half of the year.\nAt Efemcukuru, gold production, throughput and average gold grade were in line with plan.\nThe Company\u2019s profits from mining operations in Turkiye are taxed at the enacted rate and the resulting current income tax expense can be further increased or reduced by other items. In the third quarter, the Company expects the Turkish current income tax expense on mining profits, at an enacted rate of 22%, to be further increased up to $2 million. The expected increase is primarily related to the weakening of the Lira in the quarter and the resulting generation of taxable unrealized foreign exchange gains, partly offset by reductions related to Lira deposits and the investment tax credit relating to Kisladag.\nGreece\nThird quarter gold production at Olympias improved 79% over the first quarter and was in line with second quarter production. In the third quarter, Olympias had steady production, and good grade control, evidence of the progressive transformation in action. Other transformation initiatives continue at pace, as the mine continues to ramp up productivity. Full-year 2022 production at Olympias is expected to be lower than plan.\nQ3 2022 Financial and Operational Results Call Details\nEldorado will release its 2022 Third Quarter Financial and Operational Results after the market closes on Thursday, October 27, 2022, and will host a conference call on Friday, October 28, 2022, at 11:30 AM ET (8:30 AM PT).

In particular, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the terms \"mineral reserve\", \"proven mineral reserve\", \"probable mineral reserve\", \"inferred mineral resources,\", \"indicated mineral resources,\" \"measured mineral resources\" and \"mineral resources\" used or referenced herein and the documents incorporated by reference herein, as applicable, are Canadian mineral disclosure terms as defined in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 \u2014 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\") and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the \"CIM\") \u2014 CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council, as amended (the \"CIM Definition Standards\").\nFor United States reporting purposes, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") has adopted amendments to its disclosure rules (the \"SEC Modernization Rules\") to modernize the mining property disclosure requirements for issuers whose securities are registered with the SEC under the Exchange Act, which became effective February 25, 2019. The SEC Modernization Rules more closely align the SEC's disclosure requirements and policies for mining properties with current industry and global regulatory practices and standards, including NI 43-101, and replace the historical property disclosure requirements for mining registrants that were included in SEC Industry Guide 7. Issuers were required to comply with the SEC Modernization Rules in their first fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2021. As a foreign private issuer that is eligible to file reports with the SEC pursuant to the multi-jurisdictional disclosure system, the Corporation is not required to provide disclosure on its mineral properties under the SEC Modernization Rules and will continue to provide disclosure under NI 43-101 and the CIM Definition Standards. Accordingly, mineral reserve and mineral resource information contained or incorporated by reference herein may not be comparable to similar information disclosed by United States companies subject to the United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nAs a result of the adoption of the SEC Modernization Rules, the SEC now recognizes estimates of \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources.\" In addition, the SEC has amended its definitions of \"proven mineral reserves\" and \"probable mineral reserves\" to be \"substantially similar\" to the corresponding CIM Definition Standards that are required under NI 43-101. While the SEC will now recognize \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources\", U.S. investors should not assume that all or any part of the mineralization in these categories will be converted into a higher category of mineral resources or into mineral reserves without further work and analysis. Mineralization described using these terms has a greater amount of uncertainty as to its existence and feasibility than mineralization that has been characterized as reserves. Accordingly, U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any measured mineral resources, indicated mineral resources, or inferred mineral resources that the Company reports are or will be economically or legally mineable without further work and analysis. Further, \"inferred mineral resources\" have a greater amount of uncertainty and as to whether they can be mined legally or economically. Therefore, U.S. investors are also cautioned not to assume that all or any part of inferred mineral resources will be upgraded to a higher category without further work and analysis. Under Canadian securities laws, estimates of \"inferred mineral resources\" may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases. While the above terms are \"substantially similar\" to CIM Definitions, there are differences in the definitions under the SEC Modernization Rules and the CIM Definition Standards. Accordingly, there is no assurance any mineral reserves or mineral resources that the Company may report as \"proven mineral reserves\", \"probable mineral reserves\", \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources\" under NI 43-101 would be the same had the Company prepared the reserve or resource estimates under the standards adopted under the SEC Modernization Rules or under the prior standards of SEC Industry Guide 7.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\", within the meaning of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation, concerning the business, operations and financial performance and condition of Sandstorm Gold Royalties. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to the future price of gold, silver, copper, iron ore and other metals, the estimation of mineral reserves and resources, realization of mineral reserve estimates, the timing and amount of estimated future production. Forward-looking statements can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \"may\", \"will\", \"expect\", \"intend\", \"estimate\", \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"continue\", \"plans\", or similar terminology.\nForward-looking statements are made based upon certain assumptions and other important factors that, if untrue, could cause the actual results, performances or achievements of Sandstorm Gold Royalties to be materially different from future results, performances or achievements expressed or implied by such statements. Such statements and information are based on numerous assumptions regarding present and future business strategies and the environment in which Sandstorm Gold Royalties will operate in the future, including the receipt of all required approvals, the price of gold and copper and anticipated costs. Certain important factors that could cause actual results, performances or achievements to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include, amongst others, failure to receive necessary approvals, changes in business plans and strategies, market conditions, share price, best use of available cash, gold and other commodity price volatility, discrepancies between actual and estimated production, mineral reserves and resources and metallurgical recoveries, mining operational and development risks relating to the parties which produce the gold or other commodity the Company will purchase, regulatory restrictions, activities by governmental authorities (including changes in taxation), currency fluctuations, the global economic climate, dilution, share price volatility and competition.\nForward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause the actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, including but not limited to: the impact of general business and economic conditions, the absence of control over mining operations from which the Company will purchase gold, other commodities or receive royalties from, and risks related to those mining operations, including risks related to international operations, government and environmental regulation, actual results of current exploration activities, conclusions of economic evaluations and changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined, risks in the marketability of minerals, fluctuations in the price of gold and other commodities, fluctuation in foreign exchange rates and interest rates, stock market volatility, as well as those factors discussed in the section entitled \"Risks to Sandstorm\" in the Company's annual report for the financial year ended December 31, 2021 and the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" contained in the Company's annual information form dated March 31, 2022 available at www.sedar.com. Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that are contained or incorporated by reference, except in accordance with applicable securities laws.\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sandstorm-gold-royalties-provides-asset-update-301648728.html\nSOURCE Sandstorm Gold Ltd.",

All dollar amounts are in Canadian Dollars. The Company expects to file its third quarter financial statements and management discussion and analysis by November 3, 2022.\nThird Quarter 2022 Highlights\n-\nSignal Gold sold 5,615 ounces of gold in the third quarter of 2022, a 118% increase from the third quarter of 2021, generating metal revenue of $12.7 million at an average realized gold price1 of $2,258 (US$1,729) per ounce sold.\n-\nPoint Rousse produced 4,990 ounces of gold in the third quarter of 2022, an increase of 2,772 ounces or 125% from the third quarter of 2021 due to the higher-grade profile of Argyle mill feed. Production decreased 8% from Q2 2022 due to scheduled mill maintenance in September for a mill liner change.\n-\nMine operations moved 92,729 tonnes of ore during the third quarter from Argyle, a 25% increase from the second quarter of 2022 when the mine's ability to drill and blast was impeded in April from the impact of water management issues in the first half of the year. Point Rousse maintained an ore stockpile of approximately 19,600 tonnes as of September 30, 2022.\n-\nThe Pine Cove Mill processed 92,617 tonnes during the third quarter of 2022. The mill achieved a strong average recovery rate of 88.7% driven by the higher-grade Argyle mill feed in the third quarter, with mill availability reflecting the scheduled maintenance downtime.\n-\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company had a cash balance of $12.2 million and an undrawn revolving credit facility of $3.0 million.\n-\nAs a result of geotechnical challenges experienced in the quarter which necessitated a redesign of the ramp and walls, the Company is revising its guidance from the lower end of our guidance range of 21,500 to 23,000 ounces of gold to between 20,000 and 21,000 ounces of gold to reflect impacted ore access.\n1 Refer to Non-IFRS Measures Section below.\n\"Overall, Point Rousse achieved another strong quarter of production after a challenging first half of 2022, when water management issues impacted mining activity in March and April. The Company sold 5,615 ounces of gold in the third quarter to generate $12.7 million in metal revenue, a 37% increase from the second quarter as mill throughput during the quarter was exclusively from Argyle. With water management and capacity back to normal operations, Point Rousse mined 92,617 tonnes of ore in Q3 2022, an increase of 25% over the second quarter of 2022, and the operation was able to build up a stockpile at the end of the quarter. However, the operation did experience geotechnical challenges during the third quarter which required a redesign of the ramp and walls which unfortunately will impact the access to some areas of ore. The Company is accordingly revising its annual guidance to between 20,000 and 21,000 ounces of gold.\"\n~Kevin Bullock, President and CEO, Signal Gold Inc.\nSecond Quarter Operating Statistics\n| | | Three months ended September 30, 2022 | | | Three months ended September 30, 2021 | | | Nine months ended September 30, 2022 | | | Nine months ended September 30, 2021 | |\n| Mine Statistics | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Ore production (tonnes) | | | 92,729 | | | | 18,047 | | | | 235,987 | | | | 106,762 | |\n| Waste production (tonnes) | | | 533,351 | | | | 802,087 | | | | 1,640,665 | | | | 1,934,794 | |\n| Total material moved (tonnes) | | | 626,080 | | | | 820,134 | | | | 1,876,652 | | | | 2,041,556 | |\n| Waste: Ore ratio | | | 5.8 | | | | 44.4 | | | | 7.0 | | | | 18.1 | |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Mill Statistics | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Availability (%) | | | 80.7 | | | | 95.1 | | | | 87.4 | | | | 91.7 | |\n| Dry tonnes processed | | | 92,617 | | | | 118,988 | | | | 296,671 | | | | 328,551 | |\n| Tonnes per day (\"tpd\") | | | 1,261 | | | | 1,361 | | | | 1,247 | | | | 1,313 | |\n| Grade (grams per tonne) | | | 1.89 | | | | 0.67 | | | | 1.57 | | | | 0.88 | |\n| Recovery (%) | | | 88.7 | | | | 86.2 | | | | 88.2 | | | | 85.9 | |\n| Gold Ounces Produced | | | 4,990 | | | | 2,218 | | | | 13,236 | | | | 7,959 | |\n| Gold Ounces Sold | | | 5,615 | | | | 2,574 | | | | 13,204 | | | | 8,849 | |\nOperations Overview for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2022\nSignal Gold sold 5,615 ounces of gold during the third quarter of 2022, generating gold revenue of $12.7 million at an average realized gold price1 of $2,258 (US$1,729) per ounce sold. Gold production of 4,990 ounces represented an 8% decrease over the second quarter of 2022 and a 125% increase compared to the third quarter of 2021. The decrease from Q2 2022 reflects the scheduled maintenance at the mill during September for a mill liner change, and the change over the comparative period of 2021 reflects the higher-grade profile of mill throughput from Argyle.\nDuring the third quarter of 2022, the mine operations moved 92,729 tonnes of ore, an increase of 25% from the prior quarter when the mining operation was impacted by elevated ammonia levels in water in the Argyle Pit, with normal mining operations commencing in May. The Company achieved a reduced stripping ratio of 5.8 waste tonnes to ore tonnes in the third quarter of 2022, reflective of development work performed during the first half of 2022.\nThe Pine Cove Mill processed 92,617 tonnes during the third quarter of Q2 2022 and achieved a strong average recovery rate of 88.7%, consistent with Q2 2022. The strong recovery corresponds with the average mill grade of 1.89 g/t, as mill throughput was exclusively from the Argyle Mine, which helped offset the impact of the downtime due to scheduled maintenance.\n1 Refer to Non-IFRS Measures Section below.\nQualified Person\nKevin Bullock, P. Eng., President and CEO, Signal Gold Inc., is a \"qualified person\" as such term is defined in National Instrument 43-101 and has reviewed and approved the technical information and data included in this press release.\nABOUT SIGNAL GOLD\nSignal Gold is a TSX and OTCQX-listed gold mining, development, and exploration company, focused in the top-tier Canadian mining jurisdictions of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. The Company is advancing the Goldboro Gold Project in Nova Scotia, a significant growth project subject to a positive Feasibility Study with Probable Mineral Reserves of 1.15 million ounces of gold (15.80 million tonnes at 2.26 g/t gold), Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources inclusive of Mineral Reserves of 2.58 million ounces (21.6 million tonnes at 3.72 g/t gold) and additional Inferred Mineral Resources of 0.48 million ounces (3.18 million tonnes at 4.73 g/t gold) (Please see the \u2018NI43-101 Technical Report and Feasibility Study for the Goldboro Gold Project, Eastern Goldfields District, Nova Scotia' on January 11, 2022 for further details). Signal Gold also operates mining and milling operations in the prolific Baie Verte Mining District of Newfoundland which includes the fully permitted Pine Cove Mill, tailings facility and deep-water port, as well as ~15,000 hectares of highly prospective mineral property, including those adjacent to the past producing, high-grade Nugget Pond Mine at its Tilt Cove Gold Project.\nNON-IFRS MEASURES\nSignal Gold has included certain non-IFRS performance measures as detailed below. In the gold mining industry, these are common performance measures but may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance and ability to generate cash flow. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.\nAverage Realized Gold Price per Ounce Sold - In the gold mining industry, average realized gold price per ounce sold is a common performance measure that does not have any standardized meaning. The most directly comparable measure prepared in accordance with IFRS is gold revenue. The measure is intended to assist readers in evaluating the revenue received in a period from each ounce of gold sold.\nAverage realized gold price per ounce sold is reconciled to the preliminary, unaudited condensed interim consolidated statement of comprehensive income as follows:\n|\n| | Three months ended September 30, 2022 | | | Three months ended September 30, 2021 | | | Nine months ended September 30, 2022 | | | Nine months ended September 30, 2021 | |\n| | | | | | | | | | | | | |\n| Gold revenue ($) | | | 12,679,227 | | | | 5,770,632 | | | | 30,351,689 | | | | 20,058,519 | |\n| Gold ounces sold | | | 5,615 | | | | 2,574 | | | | 13,204 | | | | 8,849 | |\n| Average realized gold price per ounce sold ($) | | | 2,258 | | | | 2,242 | | | | 2,299 | | | | 2,267 | |\n| Average US Dollar exchange rate during period | | | 0.7656 | | | | 0.7937 | | | | 0.7794 | | | | 0.7994 | |\n| Average realized gold price per ounce sold (US$) | | | 1,729 | | | | 1,779 | | | | 1,792 | | | | 1,812 | |\nFor further details about non-IFRS measures, please refer to the section \"Non-IFRS Measures\" in the Company's Management's Discussion and Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2021, which is available on the Company's website and on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis news release contains \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian and United States securities legislation. Generally, forward-looking information can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \"plans\", \"expects\", or \"does not expect\", \"is expected\", \"budget\", \"scheduled\", \"estimates\", \"forecasts\", \"intends\", \"anticipates\", or \"does not anticipate\", or \"believes\" or variations of such words and phrases or state that certain actions, events or results \"may\", \"could\", \"would\", \"might\", or \"will be taken\", \"occur\", or \"be achieved\". Forward-looking information is based on the opinions and estimates of management at the date the information is made, and is based on a number of assumptions and is subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements of Signal Gold to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking information, including risks associated with the exploration, development and mining such as economic factors as they effect exploration, future commodity prices, changes in foreign exchange and interest rates, actual results of current production, development and exploration activities, government regulation, political or economic developments, environmental risks, permitting timelines, capital expenditures, operating or technical difficulties in connection with development activities, employee relations, the speculative nature of gold exploration and development, including the risks of diminishing quantities of grades of resources, contests over title to properties, and changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined as well as those risk factors discussed in Signal Gold's annual information form for the year ended December 31, 2021, available on www.sedar.com. Although Signal Gold has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking information, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended.

On September 16, 2022, the Company signed a long-term renewable power contract for the CP100 Expansion project at Cobre Panama, which shifts the total energy mix at the mine to approximately 20% renewable by the end of 2023.\nQ3 2022 SUMMARY\nIn Q3 2022, First Quantum reported gross profit of $302 million, EBITDA1 of $583 million, net earnings attributable to shareholders of $0.16 per share, and adjusted earnings of $0.14 per share2. Relative to the second quarter of this year (\u201cQ2 2022\u201d), third quarter financial results were impacted by margin compression as a result of a declining copper price and cost inflation. This was partially mitigated by higher copper sales volumes.\nTotal copper production for the third quarter was 194,974 tonnes, an increase of 2,306 tonnes from Q2 2022. The quarterly increase in production was mainly attributable to Sentinel, which achieved record throughput levels and accessed higher-grade ore. Total copper production guidance for 2022 has been lowered from 790,000 \u2013 855,000 tonnes to 755,000 \u2013 785,000 tonnes, mainly attributable to the lower production at Kansanshi.\nCopper C1 cash cost2 of $1.82 per lb for Q3 2022 was $0.08 per lb higher than Q2 2022 as inflationary pressures on key consumables continued to impact costs. Copper C1 cash cost2 guidance for 2022 has increased from $1.45 \u2013 $1.60 per lb to $1.70 \u2013 $1.80 per lb as a result of lower production from the Zambian operations and broad cost inflation. 2022 copper AISC2 cost guidance has increased from $2.15 \u2013 $2.30 per lb to $2.35 \u2013 $2.45 per lb. Market rates for fuel, sulphur, explosives and freight had reduced by the end of the third quarter, but there is a lag before such market changes flow through to unit costs.\n| 1 | EBITDA and adjusted earnings are non-GAAP financial measures.

See \u201cRegulatory Disclosures\u201d. |\nQ3 2022 OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS\nTotal copper production for Q3 2022 was 194,974 tonnes, up from the 192,668 tonnes in Q2 2022 as Sentinel achieved strong production, while production at Kansanshi was impacted by lower grades and recoveries during the quarter. Cobre Panama\u2019s strong operational performance in Q2 2022 continued into the third quarter. Copper sales volumes in Q3 2022 totaled 198,980 tonnes, approximately 4,000 tonnes higher than production, as various logistical and shipping challenges that prevailed during previous quarters eased in the third quarter.\nCopper C1 cash cost1 averaged $1.82 per lb in Q3 2022, up from $1.74 per lb in Q2 2022 as a result of broad cost inflation that was partially mitigated by an improvement in production volumes. Copper AISC cost1 averaged $2.34 per lb in Q3 2022, down from $2.37 per lb in Q2 2022.\n-\nAt Cobre Panama, record mill throughput of 22.4 million tonnes of ore with an average head grade of 0.46% was processed during the third quarter, resulting in record quarterly production of 91,671 tonnes of copper. The operation continues to benefit from improvements in blasting to improve fragmentation, along with improving mill availabilities and sustained increases in secondary and pebble crushing. Copper C1 cash cost1 of $1.43 per lb was down $0.11 per lb from the previous quarter, principally driven by improved production volumes. Copper production guidance for 2022 has been narrowed from 330,000 \u2013 360,000 tonnes to 340,000 \u2013 350,000 tonnes. Full year 2022 grades and recoveries are expected to be broadly consistent with 2021.\n-\nKansanshi produced 29,862 tonnes of copper during the third quarter, 25% lower than Q2 2022 due to lower grades across all three circuits and the resulting impact on recoveries. Access to the M12 cutback was restricted until the end of the third quarter due to accumulation of water in the main pit. As a result, low-grade oxide ore and tarnished sulphide ore from stockpiles were processed through the oxide and mixed circuits, respectively. Dewatering of the M12 area has been completed and planned mining activities resumed toward the end of the third quarter. The decline in the oxide ore grade was due to the depletion of higher-grade areas and sulphide feed grade was impacted by continued feed from narrow-veined regions as a result of the current mine layout and mining sequence. Copper C1 cash cost1 of $2.93 per lb was 60% higher than the previous quarter, mainly due to lower production and continued high costs for key consumables. 2022 production guidance at Kansanshi has been lowered from 175,000 \u2013 195,000 tonnes to 140,000 \u2013 150,000 tonnes to reflect the challenges year-to-date. Production volumes are expected to continue at lower levels until the completion of the S3 Expansion project.\n-\nSentinel delivered its best quarterly production of the year with 64,120 tonnes of copper produced, 22% higher than production in Q2 2022. Sentinel reached its target run rate of 62 million tonnes per annum ahead of schedule, allowing the operation to achieve its highest quarterly throughput for the year. Grade improved during the quarter with more consistent higher-grade ore being exposed in the Stage 1 and Stage 2 pits. Copper C1 cash cost1 of $1.77 per lb was 6% lower than Q2 2022 as higher production more than offset the impact of elevated cost pressures. While grade is expected to continue to improve in the fourth quarter as higher grade ore is exposed, the slower turnover of benches earlier in the year has resulted in a guidance reduction in 2022 from 250,000 \u2013 265,000 tonnes to 240,000 \u2013 250,000 tonnes.\n-\nRavensthorpe\u2019s nickel production for the third quarter of 2022 was 5,849 contained tonnes, a 21% increase over Q2 2022. HPAL rates improved in the third quarter on the back of improved beneficiation plant availability and stability. Nickel C1 cash cost1 was $9.12 per lb during the period, a 10% decrease from the previous quarter, as higher production volumes offset higher processing costs of sulphur and fuel. Finished goods at the end of the third quarter totaled 2,576 tonnes due to recent slowing in demand for MHP, predominantly out of China. The 2022 nickel production guidance range has been lowered from 25,000 \u2013 30,000 tonnes to 20,000 \u2013 23,000 tonnes based on lower year-to-date production. Nickel C1 cash cost1 guidance has been updated from $6.25 \u2013 $7.00 per lb to $8.25 \u2013 $9.00 per lb.\n| 1 | Copper C1 cash cost (copper C1) and Nickel C1 cash costs (nickel C1) are non-GAAP ratios which do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and might not be comparable to similar financial measures disclosed by other issuers.

The decreases are attributable to a lower realized copper and gold price2 and cost inflation, partially mitigated by higher copper sales volumes.\n-\nGross profit of $302 million and EBITDA1 of $583 million for the third quarter decreased from Q2 2022 which had gross profit of $629 million and EBITDA1 of $906 million. The decline is attributable to lower realized metal prices2 and cost inflation, partially mitigated by higher copper sales volumes.\n-\nNet debt2 was stable during the third quarter, although a small decrease of $10 million was recorded, taking the net debt2 balance down to $5,329 million as at September 30, 2022. As at September 30, 2022, total debt was $7,118 million (June 30, 2022, total debt was $7,164 million). The Company has achieved its debt reduction target of $2 billion, from the peak in the second quarter of 2020, and continues to target a further $1 billion reduction in the medium term.\n-\nCash flows from operating activities were $525 million ($0.76 per share2) during the third quarter compared to $904 million ($1.31 per share2) in Q2 2022.\n-\nOn July 26, 2022, the Company declared an interim dividend of CDN$0.16 per share, in respect of the financial year ended December 31, 2022 (July 27, 2021: CDN$0.005 per share), which was paid on September 20, 2022 to shareholders of record on August 29, 2022. This is the first payment under the Company\u2019s new dividend policy.\n2022 GUIDANCE\nTotal copper production guidance for 2022 has been lowered from 790,000 \u2013 855,000 tonnes to 755,000 \u2013 785,000 tonnes, mainly attributable to lower production at Kansanshi.\n-\n2022 copper production guidance for Cobre Panama has been narrowed from 330,000 \u2013 360,000 tonnes to 340,000 \u2013 350,000 tonnes. Full year 2022 grades and recoveries are expected to be broadly consistent with 2021. Unit 2 of the power plant at Cobre Panama has undergone a biennial scheduled total shutdown for maintenance during October, with replacement of electrical power sourced from the national grid at spot prices.\n-\nAt Kansanshi, year-to-date production has been impacted by reduced proportions of oxide ore mining and increased proportions of sulphide ore mining. Access to the M12 oxide ore area cutback was restricted until the end of the third quarter due to water in the main pit. Although dewatering of M12 was completed during the third quarter and greater redundancy installed for the coming rainy season, some of the planned oxide ore feed from this zone will be pushed into 2023. Further, mining of sulphide ores at Kansanshi is currently constrained to veinous sulphide ores. Optimization of mine plans to provide flexibility, including into additional sulphide mining from stratiform mineralisation, continue. Kansanshi\u2019s guidance has been lowered from 175,000 \u2013 195,000 tonnes to 140,000 \u2013 150,000 tonnes to reflect the challenges year-to-date. Full optimization of mining from the sulphide ores is anticipated when the mining methods move from the current flitch mining to full face shovel mining techniques as the new mining fleet for the S3 Expansion is brought online during 2023/24. In the interim, production volumes are expected to continue at lower levels until completion of the S3 Expansion project.\n-\nAt Sentinel, while grade is expected to continue to improve in the fourth quarter as higher-grade ore is exposed in both the Stage 1 and 2 pits, the slower turnover of benches earlier in the year to reach higher-grade ore has resulted in a guidance reduction from 250,000 \u2013 265,000 tonnes to 240,000 \u2013 250,000 tonnes.\n| 1 | Adjusted earnings and EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures and net debt is a supplementary financial measure.

The copper C1 cash cost1 guidance range has increased from $1.45 \u2013 $1.60 per lb to a range of $1.70 \u2013 $1.80 per lb. The increase is attributable to lower production at the Zambian operations and broad cost inflation, which continued to increase further during the third quarter and remained at elevated levels. Market rates for fuel, sulphur, explosives and freight had reduced by the end of the quarter but there is a lag before such market changes flow through to unit costs. Employee costs rose during the third quarter as the Company realigned labour rates to current market levels and adjusted for cost-of-living changes in some jurisdictions.\nCopper AISC1 cost for the third quarter and first nine months of the year at $2.34 per lb and $2.33 per lb, respectively, are above the top end of the previous guidance range of $2.15 \u2013 $2.30 per lb. Royalties included within copper AISC1 is dependent on the market price of copper and was relatively high for the first six months of the year before falling in the third quarter. The copper AISC1 cost guidance range has increased to $2.35 \u2013 $2.45 per lb.\nGold production guidance has been reduced from 285,000 \u2013 310,000 ounces to 270,000 \u2013 285,000 ounces based on production achieved in the first nine months of 2022 due to lower grades at Cobre Panama and Kansanshi.\nRavensthorpe nickel production guidance has been lowered from 25,000 \u2013 30,000 tonnes to 20,000 \u2013 23,000 tonnes based on lower year-to-date production, while nickel C1 cash cost1 and AISC1 guidance ranges have been updated to $8.25 \u2013 $9.00 per lb and $9.75 \u2013 $10.50 per lb, respectively.\nGuidance for total capital expenditure in 2022 has remained unchanged at $1,250 million. Capitalized stripping3 guidance has reduced from $250 million to $230 million, whereas project capital3 has increased from $690 million to $710 million. Sustaining capital3 of $310 million remains unchanged. While capital expenditure is expected to be in line with guidance, the Company is experiencing inflation in capital expenditures.\nPRODUCTION GUIDANCE\n|\n| 000\u2019s | 2022 |\n| 2022 |\n|\n|\n| Copper (tonnes) | 790 \u2013 855 |\n| 755 \u2013 785 |\n|\n|\n| Gold (ounces) | 285 \u2013 310 |\n| 270 \u2013 285 |\n|\n|\n| Nickel (contained tonnes) | 25 \u2013 30 |\n| 20 \u2013 23 |\n|\nPRODUCTION GUIDANCE BY OPERATION2\n|\n| Copper production guidance (000\u2019s tonnes) | 2022 |\n| 2022 |\n|\n|\n| Cobre Panama | 330 \u2013 360 |\n| 340 \u2013 350 |\n|\n|\n| Kansanshi | 175 \u2013 195 |\n| 140 \u2013 150 |\n|\n|\n| Sentinel | 250 \u2013 265 |\n| 240 \u2013 250 |\n|\n|\n| Other sites | 35 |\n| 35 |\n|\n|\n| Gold production guidance (000\u2019s ounces) |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| Cobre Panama | 135 \u2013 150 |\n| 130 \u2013 140 |\n|\n|\n| Kansanshi | 120 \u2013 130 |\n| 110 \u2013 115 |\n|\n|\n| Other sites | 30 |\n| 30 |\n|\n|\n| Nickel production guidance (000\u2019s contained tonnes) |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| Ravensthorpe | 25 \u2013 30 |\n| 20 \u2013 23 |\n|\n| 1 | C1 cash cost (C1), and all-in sustaining cost (AISC) are non-GAAP ratios, and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and might not be comparable to similar financial measures disclosed by other issuers.

Completion of construction works and commencement of commissioning is targeted for the first quarter of 2023 to allow for a ramp up of production over the course of the year and achieve a throughput rate of 100 million tonnes per annum by the end of 2023. Significant progress has been made on the pre-strip work for the Colina pit and earthworks for the associated overland conveyor and in-pit crushing facility. The fifth rope shovel is set to enter service at the Colina pit by the end of 2022 to continue advancing the crusher box cut and pre-strip. The first crusher at Colina is expected to be commissioned in 2024. The Company entered into a long-term, fixed-price contract with AES Panama an independent power producer, for the purchase of 64 megawatts (\u201cMW\u201d) of electrical power for the CP100 Expansion project. The contract subsequently received regulatory approval from the National Dispatch Centre in September 2022.\nAt the Kansanshi S3 Expansion project, long-lead items have been procured, including the primary crusher, mills and mining fleet. Engineering contractors have commenced with detailed designs. Engineering has also commenced on the related Kansanshi smelter expansion project. Orders have been placed for key long-lead items associated with the oxygen plant, acid plant, and wet electrostatic precipitation. The S3 Expansion mining fleet has been procured with deliveries commencing in H2 2023, which will enable the mine to transition ahead of the plant commissioning in 2025.\nThe main work stream to bring the Enterprise nickel project online, the pre-strip of the mine, commenced in May 2022. The project is on schedule for first ore in the first half of 2023. In parallel, mine facilities are being developed, including the satellite administration office, workshop, fuel storage, haul road upgrade, dewatering boreholes and other facilities. Plant refurbishment, completion and commissioning activities are on schedule and are aligned to the pre-stripping duration.\nApproval of the Las Cruces Underground Project is not expected before the end of 2023 and will take into consideration prevailing economic conditions. The Company published an updated technical report on January 17, 2022 with an updated Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources of 41.2 million tonnes of Polymetallic Primary Sulphide. Further detailed technical work is being conducted to convert Mineral Resources to Mineral Reserves as part of the Las Cruces Underground Project.\nZAMBIAN TAX REGIME\nOn September 30, 2022, the Minister of Finance and National Planning presented the 2023 National Budget. The key announcements affecting the mining industry include the restructuring of the Mineral Royalty tax regime and the reinstatement of taxes and duties on fuel that was previously suspended.\nThe restructuring of the Mineral Royalty tax regime is expected to be effective from January 1, 2023 and includes an amendment to the calculation of mineral royalty tax. Royalties will now be incurred on an incremental basis. In addition, an amendment was made to the mineral royalty tax bands determining the mineral royalty tax rate applicable at various price levels, as shown below.\n|\n| Price |\n| Current Rates |\n|\n| Price |\n| Revised Rates |\n|\n|\n|\n| 0 \u2013 4,499 |\n| 5.5% |\n|\n| 0 \u2013 4,000 |\n| 4.0% |\n|\n|\n|\n| 4,500 \u2013 5,999 |\n| 6.5% |\n|\n| 4,001 \u2013 5,000 |\n| 6.5% |\n|\n|\n|\n| 6,000 \u2013 7,499 |\n| 7.5% |\n|\n| 5,001 \u2013 7,000 |\n| 8.5% |\n|\n|\n|\n| 7,500 \u2013 8,999 |\n| 8.5% |\n|\n| 7,001+ |\n| 10.0% |\n|\n|\n|\n| 9,000+ |\n| 10.0% |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nThe reinstatement of taxes and duties on fuel, which were suspended in January 2021, includes the reinstatement of excise duties and a standard rated VAT effective from October 1, 2022 and the reinstatement of import duties that is expected to be effective January 1, 2023.\nZAMBIAN VAT\nDuring the second quarter, the Company reached an agreement with the Government Republic of Zambia for repayment of the outstanding VAT claims based on offsets against future corporate income tax and mineral royalty tax payments, which commenced July 1, 2022.\nPANAMA LAW 9 UPDATE\nFirst Quantum and the Government of Panama (\u201cGOP\u201d) continue to finalize the details behind the agreed upon principles, namely that the GOP should receive $375 million in benefits per year from Cobre Panama and that the existing revenue royalty will be replaced by a gross profit royalty. The parties continue to finalize the details behind these principles, including the appropriate mechanisms that would achieve the desired outcome, the necessary protections to the Company\u2019s business for downside copper price and production scenarios and ensuring that the new contract and legislation are both durable and sustainable. In the second quarter of 2022, the Minister of Commerce was replaced and discussions have subsequently continued in order, including installation of a bilateral contractual drafting committee in early September 2022. First Quantum remains committed to a timely conclusion of the Law 9 issue. Once an agreement is concluded and the full contract is documented, it is expected that the newly drafted legislation would be put to the Panamanian National Assembly.\nENVIRONMENT, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE\nOn September 1, 2022, the Company announced changes to senior management with the appointment of Ryan MacWilliam as Chief Financial Officer and Rudi Badenhorst as Chief Operating Officer.\nThe Company entered into a long-term, fixed-price contract with AES Panama, an independent power producer, for the purchase of 64MW of electrical power for the demand requirements of the CP100 Expansion project, which subsequently received regulatory approval from the National Dispatch Centre in September 2022. The expansion project will be supplied by 100% renewable energy from a portfolio that includes a combination of solar, wind, and hydroelectric generation. The cost of power under this agreement will be broadly in line with the current all-in cost of power generated by the Cobre Panama power station and favourable compared to what costs would be at current thermal coal prices. The current all-in cost of power at the power station includes depreciation and the collar structure for coal purchases that expire at the end of 2023. This additional power is required at Cobre Panama as operations ramp up over 2023 for the CP100 Expansion and, as a result, the total energy mix at the mine will move to approximately 20% renewable by this time. This represents an important first step towards the Company\u2019s target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2025 and 50% by 2030.\nOn September 9, 2022, the Company, in conjunction with The Minister of Labour and Workforce Development (\u201cMITRADEL\u201d), Doris Zapata, inaugurated the Training Centre for Industrial Professions in La Pintada province, Panama. The Company invested $5 million in developing the facility, which will offer subsidized technical education to individuals between the ages of 18 and 35 years old in a range of areas for careers in the mining and industrial sectors. Working closely with MITRADEL, the qualifications received by the students at the training centre will be endorsed by the Panamanian National Institute of Vocational Training and Training for Human Development. The training centre seeks to offer new opportunities for host communities around Cobre Panama and, in particular, to increase the representation of women, who have accounted for almost a third of the students enrolled to date.\nThe Company launched the CARE program at its Zambian operations in July 2022. The program's goal is to empower individuals at First Quantum\u2019s Zambian operations with the right skills and knowledge to deliver world-class maintenance on the Company\u2019s mobile fleet. CARE will provide the teams in Zambia with enhanced career paths, high-quality development opportunities and improve the employee experience. The program supports a predictive maintenance culture that will deliver further productivity and sustainability benefits through reduced use of oil and consumables as well as extending component life.\nCOMPLETE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nThe complete Consolidated Financial Statements and Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2022 are available at www.first-quantum.com and at www.sedar.com and should be read in conjunction with this news release.\nCONFERENCE CALL DETAILS\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast to discuss the results on Wednesday, October 26, 2022 at 9:00 am (EDT).\nConference call and webcast details:\nToll-free North America: 1-800-319-4610\nToll International: +1-604-638-5340\nWebcast: www.first-quantum.com\nA replay of the webcast will be available on the First Quantum website.\nFor further information, visit our website at www.first-quantum.com or contact:\nBonita To, Director, Investor Relations\n(416) 361-6400 Toll-free: 1 (888) 688-6577\nE-Mail: info@fqml.com\nREGULATORY DISCLOSURES\nNon-GAAP and Other Financial Measures\nEBITDA, ADJUSTED EARNINGS AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE\nEBITDA, adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share exclude certain impacts which the Company believes are not reflective of the Company\u2019s underlying performance for the reporting period.

Realized metal prices are calculated as gross metal sales revenues divided by the volume of metal sold in lbs. Net realized metal price is inclusive of the treatment and refining charges (TC/RC) and freight charges per lb.\nOPERATING CASHFLOW PER SHARE\nIn calculating the operating cash flow per share, the operating cash flow calculated for IFRS purposes is divided by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding for the respective period.\nNET DEBT\nNet debt comprises unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, bank overdrafts and total debt.\nCASH COST, ALL-IN SUSTAINING COST, TOTAL COST\nThe consolidated cash cost (C1), all-in sustaining cost (AISC) and total cost (C3) presented by the Company are measures that are prepared on a basis consistent with the industry standard definitions by the World Gold Council and Brook Hunt cost guidelines but are not measures recognized under IFRS. In calculating the C1 cash cost, AISC and C3, total cost for each segment, the costs are measured on the same basis as the segmented financial information that is contained in the financial statements.\nC1 cash cost includes all mining and processing costs less any profits from by-products such as gold, silver, zinc, pyrite, cobalt, sulphuric acid, or iron magnetite and is used by management to evaluate operating performance. TC/RC and freight deductions on metal sales, which are typically recognized as a component of sales revenues, are added to C1 cash cost to arrive at an approximate cost of finished metal.\nAISC is defined as cash cost (C1) plus general and administrative expenses, sustaining capital expenditure, deferred stripping, royalties and lease payments and is used by management to evaluate performance inclusive of sustaining expenditure required to maintain current production levels.\nC3 total cost is defined as AISC less sustaining capital expenditure, deferred stripping and general and administrative expenses net of insurance, plus depreciation and exploration. This metric is used by management to evaluate the operating performance inclusive of costs not classified as sustaining in nature such as exploration and depreciation.\n| For the three months ended September 30, 2022 | Cobre Panama |\n| Kansanshi |\n| Sentinel |\n| Guelb Moghrein |\n| Las Cruces |\n| \u00c7ayeli |\n| Pyh\u00e4salmi |\n|\n| Copper |\n| Corporate & other |\n| Ravensthorpe |\n| Total |\n| ||||||||\n| Cost of sales1 |\n| (491 | ) |\n| (359 | ) |\n| (342 | ) |\n| (50 | ) |\n| (27 | ) |\n| (17 | ) |\n| (8 | ) |\n| (1,294 | ) | (4 | ) |\n| (127 | ) | (1,425 | ) |\n| Adjustments: |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| ||||||||||||||||||||\n| Depreciation |\n| 160 |\n|\n| 59 |\n|\n| 80 |\n|\n| 4 |\n|\n| -

For further information, please see the Company\u2019s Consolidated Financial Statements and Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&A\") filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com under the Company\u2019s profile.\nThird Quarter 2022 Summary\nOperations\n-\nGold production: 118,791 ounces, a 5% increase from Q2 2022, demonstrating improvements across the portfolio.\n-\nGold sales: 118,388 ounces at an average realized gold price per ounce sold1 of $1,688.\n-\nProduction costs: $123.5 million.\n-\nCash operating costs1: $803 per ounce sold. Higher costs during the quarter were primarily driven by increases in the price of certain commodities and consumables, including electricity at operations in Greece and Turkiye, and fuel and reagents at Kisladag. Price increases were partly offset by the weakening of local currencies in which costs are incurred, particularly the Turkish Lira and Euro.\n-\nAll-in sustaining costs (\"AISC\")1: $1,259 per ounce sold, driven by higher cash operating costs per ounce sold and sustaining capital expenditures.\n-\nTotal capital expenditures: $74.0 million, including $32.8 million of sustaining capital1, primarily focused on underground development and construction and expansion of the tailings management facility at Lamaque. Growth capital1 of $24.2 million focused on waste stripping at Kisladag and continued construction work of the North leach pad. $11.8 million of capital expenditures spent at Skouries include expenditures related to progressing building enclosures, other construction, and execution readiness.\nFinancial\n-\nCash, cash equivalents and term deposits: $306.4 million, as at September 30, 2022. Cash balance decreased during the quarter as a result of a $16 million bond interest payment and a $20 million investment in the G Mining Ventures Corp. equity financing.\n-\nCash flow from operating activities before changes in working capital1: $55.0 million.\n-\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\")1: $42.8 million.\n-\nAdjusted EBITDA1: $73.5 million.\n-\nNet loss: $50.5 million, or a loss of $0.27 per share.\n-\nAdjusted net loss1: $8.0 million or $0.04 loss per share. Adjusted net loss removed an $18.4 million loss on foreign exchange due to translation of deferred tax balances and a $29.3 million impairment of the Certej project.\n-\nFree cash flow1: Negative $25.9 million, primarily due to lower average realized gold price, mine standby costs and continued investment in growth capital at Kisladag and Skouries.\nOther\n-\nSkouries: On September 7, 2022, Eldorado announced the signing of a Mandate Letter with Greek banks for a credit committee approved \u20ac680 million project finance facility for the development of the Skouries project, which represents 80% of the total funding requirement. The Mandate Letter includes a long-form term sheet, which contains customary terms and conditions, including with respect to due diligence, and remains subject to negotiation of definitive binding loan documentation and to other approvals and conditions, including board approval. Since the signing of the Mandate Letter, Eldorado has been working diligently with Greek banks to advance loan documentation. A final decision to re-start construction and to approve definitive loan documentation remains subject to Board approval, which we expect to seek before the end of 2022.\n\u201cDuring the third quarter, our global operations performed well, as our consolidated production continues to track within our annual guidance,\" said George Burns, Eldorado's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"In Turkiye, quarterly production increased considerably at Kisladag as the team continued to optimize on-belt agglomeration. Additionally, there was an increase in tonnes placed on the pad during the third quarter, which supports a strong finish to the year for production,\u201d continued Burns. \u201cAt Efemcukuru, the team continued to do an exceptional job, delivering yet another quarter on plan. At Lamaque, production decreased quarter over quarter due to lower throughput, however mine sequencing plans are expected to deliver strong fourth quarter results.\u201d\n\u201cWe are, like others, continuing to face inflationary pressures, especially in electricity in Greece and Turkiye, and fuel and reagents at Kisladag. Additionally, we are actively managing costs associated with the VAT import charge on the Olympias gold concentrate shipments into China and shipments to alternative markets started in mid-2022 and continue to be explored,\u201d said Burns.\nConsolidated Financial and Operational Highlights\n|\n| 3 months ended September 30, |\n| 9 months ended September 30, | |||||||||\n| Continuing operations (4) |\n| 2022 |\n|\n| 2021 |\n|\n| 2022 |\n|\n| 2021 |\n|\n| Revenue | $217.7 |\n| $238.4 |\n| $625.8 |\n| $696.3 |\n| ||||\n| Gold produced (oz) |\n| 118,791 |\n|\n| 125,459 |\n|\n| 325,462 |\n|\n| 353,268 |\n|\n| Gold sold (oz) |\n| 118,388 |\n|\n| 125,189 |\n|\n| 320,491 |\n|\n| 352,923 |\n|\n| Average realized gold price ($/oz sold) (2) | $1,688 |\n| $1,772 |\n| $1,801 |\n| $1,781 |\n| ||||\n| Production costs |\n| 123.5 |\n|\n| 110.2 |\n|\n| 337.4 |\n|\n| 331.5 |\n|\n| Cash operating costs ($/oz sold) (2,3) |\n| 803 |\n|\n| 646 |\n|\n| 807 |\n|\n| 644 |\n|\n| Total cash costs ($/oz sold) (2,3) |\n| 892 |\n|\n| 743 |\n|\n| 902 |\n|\n| 726 |\n|\n| All-in sustaining costs ($/oz sold) (2,3) |\n| 1,259 |\n|\n| 1,133 |\n|\n| 1,289 |\n|\n| 1,066 |\n|\n| Net (loss) earnings for the period (1) |\n| (50.5 | ) |\n| 8.5 |\n|\n| (390.0 | ) |\n| 53.9 |\n|\n| Net (loss) earnings per share \u2013 basic ($/share) (1) |\n| (0.27 | ) |\n| 0.05 |\n|\n| (2.13 | ) |\n| 0.30 |\n|\n| Adjusted net (loss) earnings (1,2) |\n| (8.0 | ) |\n| 39.9 |\n|\n| (13.2 | ) |\n| 94.2 |\n|\n| Adjusted net (loss) earnings per share ($/share) (1,2) |\n| (0.04 | ) |\n| 0.22 |\n|\n| (0.07 | ) |\n| 0.52 |\n|\n| Net cash generated from operating activities |\n| 52.5 |\n|\n| 105.1 |\n|\n| 114.7 |\n|\n| 253.3 |\n|\n| Cash flow from operating activities before changes in |\n| 55.0 |\n|\n| 101.0 |\n|\n| 153.1 |\n|\n| 258.1 |\n|\n| Free cash flow (2) |\n| (25.9 | ) |\n| 29.7 |\n|\n| (115.5 | ) |\n| 39.3 |\n|\n| Cash, cash equivalents and term deposits | $306.4 |\n| $439.3 |\n| $306.4 |\n| $439.3 |\n|\n| (1) | Attributable to shareholders of the Company. |\n| (2) | These financial measures or ratios are non-IFRS financial measures or ratios.

The Brazil segment is presented as a discontinued operation in 2021. See Note 17 of our condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. |\nTotal revenue was $217.7 million in Q3 2022, a decrease of 9% from $238.4 million in Q3 2021 and an increase of 2% from $213.4 million in Q2 2022. Total revenue was $625.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, a decrease from $696.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The decreases in both three and nine-month periods were primarily due to lower sales volumes, and decreases in the three-month period were also due to the 5% decrease in average realized gold price.\nProduction costs increased to $123.5 million in Q3 2022 from $110.2 million in Q3 2021 and to $337.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 from $331.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Increases in both periods were primarily due to substantial price increases for certain commodities and consumables as a result of supply concerns caused by financial and trade sanctions against Russia, and ongoing supply chain challenges due to the novel coronavirus (\"COVID-19\"). Cost increases primarily impacted electricity at operations in Greece and Turkiye, and fuel and reagents at Kisladag.\nCash operating costs averaged $803 per ounce sold in Q3 2022, an increase from $646 in Q3 2021, and cash operating costs per ounce sold averaged $807 in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, an increase from $644 in the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Increases in both three and nine-month periods were primarily due to lower production at Kisladag and price increases for certain commodities and consumables. Cash operating costs per ounce sold at Efemcukuru in Q3 2021 also benefited from the structure of concentrate sales contracts which resulted in lower selling costs in that quarter.\nAISC per ounce sold averaged $1,259 in Q3 2022, an increase from $1,133 in Q3 2021, and AISC per ounce sold averaged $1,289 in the nine months ended September 30, 2022, an increase from $1,066 in the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Increases in both three and nine-month periods primarily reflect the increases in cash operating costs per ounce sold, and increases in the nine-month period were also due to higher sustaining capital expenditures.\nWe reported net loss attributable to shareholders from continuing operations of $50.5 million ($0.27 loss per share) in Q3 2022 compared to net earnings of $8.5 million ($0.05 per share) in Q3 2021 and net loss of $390.0 million ($2.13 loss per share) in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to net earnings of $53.9 million ($0.30 per share) in the nine months ended September 30, 2021. The net loss in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to the impairment of the Certej project, a non-core gold asset, the write-down of decommissioned equipment at Kisladag, lower sales volumes, higher mine standby costs and higher income tax expense.\nAdjusted net loss was $8.0 million ($0.04 loss per share) in Q3 2022 compared to adjusted net earnings of $39.9 million ($0.22 per share) in Q3 2021. Adjusted net loss in Q3 2022 removed an $18.4 million loss on foreign exchange due to translation of deferred tax balances and a $29.3 million impairment of the Certej project.\nQuarterly Operations Update\n|\n| 3 months ended September 30, | 9 months ended September 30, | ||||||\n|\n|\n| 2022 |\n| 2021 |\n| 2022 |\n| 2021 |\n| Consolidated |\n|\n|\n|\n| ||||\n| Ounces produced |\n| 118,791 |\n| 125,459 |\n| 325,462 |\n| 353,268 |\n| Ounces sold |\n| 118,388 |\n| 125,189 |\n| 320,491 |\n| 352,923 |\n| Production costs (1) | $123.5 | $110.2 | $337.4 | $331.5 | ||||\n| Cash operating costs ($/oz sold) (2,3) | $803 | $646 | $807 | $644 | ||||\n| All-in sustaining costs ($/oz sold) (2,3) | $1,259 | $1,133 | $1,289 | $1,066 | ||||\n| Sustaining capital expenditures (3) | $32.8 | $34.7 | $89.6 | $79.3 | ||||\n| Kisladag |\n|\n|\n|\n| ||||\n| Ounces produced |\n| 37,741 |\n| 51,040 |\n| 95,494 |\n| 141,229 |\n| Ounces sold |\n| 37,721 |\n| 51,038 |\n| 94,380 |\n| 142,593 |\n| Production costs | $32.7 | $38.9 | $87.9 | $93.8 | ||||\n| Cash operating costs ($/oz sold) (2,3) | $752 | $612 | $800 | $546 | ||||\n| All-in sustaining costs ($/oz sold) (2,3) | $993 | $916 | $1,049 | $755 | ||||\n| Sustaining capital expenditures (3) | $4.8 | $8.2 | $11.6 | $14.7 | ||||\n| Lamaque |\n|\n|\n|\n| ||||\n| Ounces produced |\n| 42,454 |\n| 37,369 |\n| 122,748 |\n| 101,847 |\n| Ounces sold |\n| 42,385 |\n| 37,381 |\n| 122,165 |\n| 101,136 |\n| Production costs | $28.8 | $25.3 | $87.5 | $72.3 | ||||\n| Cash operating costs ($/oz sold) (2,3) | $650 | $646 | $684 | $683 | ||||\n| All-in sustaining costs ($/oz sold) (2,3) | $1,106 | $1,130 | $1,082 | $1,117 | ||||\n| Sustaining capital expenditures (3) | $18.2 | $13.7 | $44.7 | $34.0 | ||||\n| Efemcukuru |\n|\n|\n|\n| ||||\n| Ounces produced |\n| 22,473 |\n| 23,305 |\n| 66,322 |\n| 70,076 |\n| Ounces sold |\n| 22,488 |\n| 23,825 |\n| 67,298 |\n| 70,961 |\n| Production costs | $17.7 | $16.6 | $55.2 | $49.1 | ||||\n| Cash operating costs ($/oz sold) (2,3) | $709 | $552 | $689 | $534 | ||||\n| All-in sustaining costs ($/oz sold) (2,3) | $1,039 | $911 | $1,075 | $839 | ||||\n| Sustaining capital expenditures (3) | $4.1 | $5.3 | $13.5 | $11.7 | ||||\n| Olympias |\n|\n|\n|\n| ||||\n| Ounces produced |\n| 16,123 |\n| 13,745 |\n| 40,898 |\n| 40,116 |\n| Ounces sold |\n| 15,794 |\n| 12,945 |\n| 36,648 |\n| 38,233 |\n| Production costs | $44.3 | $27.3 | $106.6 | $85.2 | ||||\n| Cash operating costs ($/oz sold) (2,3) | $1,466 | $952 | $1,455 | $1,110 | ||||\n| All-in sustaining costs ($/oz sold) (2,3) | $2,070 | $1,728 | $2,240 | $1,806 | ||||\n| Sustaining capital expenditures (3) | $5.7 | $7.5 | $19.8 | $19.0 |\n| (1) | Includes production costs of Stratoni (base metals production) in 2021 (Q3 2021: $2.0 million, YTD 2021: $31.1 million).

Production in the quarter benefited from increased tonnes placed on the heap leach pad in Q2 2022, following reduced productivity in early 2022 as a result of snowfall and prolonged freezing temperatures. However, gold production in the quarter decreased 26% from 51,040 ounces in Q3 2021 as tonnes placed on the heap leach pad during 2022 remain below 2021 levels due to continued debottlenecking of the belt agglomeration circuit, reducing stacking capacity. On-belt agglomeration continues to perform as expected and the HPGR is performing to plan with recovery rates as expected. Average grade of 0.72 grams per tonne in Q3 2022 increased slightly from 0.71 grams per tonne in Q3 2021 and decreased from 0.76 grams per tonne in Q2 2022.\nRevenue decreased to $65.7 million in Q3 2022 from $92.5 million in Q3 2021, reflecting lower sales in the quarter, and to a lesser extent, a decrease in the average realized gold price.\nProduction costs decreased to $32.7 million in Q3 2022 from $38.9 million in Q3 2021 primarily due to a reduction in consumables used in line with lower production and efficiencies from the HPGR circuit, and weakening of the Turkish Lira. These savings were partly offset by price increases in labour, reagents, electricity, and fuel. Lower production resulted in an increase in cash operating costs per ounce sold to $752 in Q3 2022 from $612 in Q3 2021.\nAISC per ounce sold increased to $993 in Q3 2022 from $916 in Q3 2021 primarily due to the increase in cash operating costs per ounce sold and was partly offset by a reduction in sustaining capital expenditure.\nSustaining capital expenditures of $4.8 million in Q3 2022 and $11.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 primarily included equipment rebuilds and processing improvements. Growth capital expenditures of $17.6 million and $61.3 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 included waste stripping to support the mine life extension and construction of the first phase of the North heap leach pad.\nIn conjunction with the North heap leach pad, we are investing in additional higher-capacity mobile conveyors which are expected to enhance materials handling capabilities in the belt agglomeration circuit and increase throughput. Installation is expected to be complete in late 2022. We are also installing an agglomeration drum, expected to be commissioned in the first half of 2023, which is expected to improve the quality, consistency and permeability of the agglomeration process. With these investments, stacking is expected to continue on the existing heap leach pad until mid-2023, at which time stacking is expected to commence on the North heap leach pad.\nLamaque\nLamaque produced 42,454 ounces of gold in Q3 2022, an increase of 14% from 37,369 ounces in Q3 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher average grade and partly offset by lower throughput. Tonnes processed were reduced by COVID-19 related absenteeism in July and early August before returning to normal levels. Average grade increased to 7.28 grams per tonne in Q3 2022 from 5.99 grams per tonne in Q3 2021 and from 6.63 grams per tonne in Q2 2022. Underground development of high-grade stopes progressed well during the quarter.\nRevenue increased to $73.1 million in Q3 2022 from $66.8 million in Q3 2021 primarily due to higher production in the quarter and partly offset by a lower average realized gold price.\nProduction costs increased to $28.8 million in Q3 2022 from $25.3 million in Q3 2021, primarily due to higher production in the quarter. Cash operating costs per ounce sold rose slightly to $650 in Q3 2022 from $646 in Q3 2021 as cost increases for consumables were mostly offset by higher production and cost savings from a weaker Canadian dollar.\nAISC per ounce sold decreased to $1,106 in Q3 2022 from $1,130 in Q3 2021 primarily due to higher gold production in the quarter and reduced sustaining exploration expenditure. These reductions were partly offset by an increase in sustaining capital expenditure.\nSustaining capital expenditures of $18.2 million in Q3 2022 and $44.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 primarily included underground development and expansion of the tailings management facility. Growth capital expenditures of $1.5 million in Q3 2022 and $4.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily related to construction of underground infrastructure.\nEfemcukuru\nEfemcukuru produced 22,473 payable ounces of gold in Q3 2022, a 4% decrease from 23,305 payable ounces in Q3 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a planned decrease in grade to 5.74 grams per tonne in Q3 2022 from 6.44 grams per tonne in Q3 2021, and was partly offset by higher throughput in the quarter.\nRevenue decreased to $34.3 million in Q3 2022 from $41.9 million in Q3 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a lower average realized gold price during Q3 2022 as a result of downward revaluations of provisional pricing in the quarter in line with movements in the gold price.\nProduction costs increased to $17.7 million in Q3 2022 from $16.6 million in Q3 2021 primarily due to increased tonnes processed, combined with cost increases in electricity, and consumables. The increase in production costs, combined with slightly lower production in the quarter, resulted in an increase in cash operating costs per ounce sold to $709 in Q3 2022 from $552 in Q3 2021. Cash operating costs per ounce sold in Q3 2021 also benefited from the structure of concentrate sales contracts which resulted in lower selling costs in that quarter.\nAISC per ounce sold increased to $1,039 in Q3 2022 from $911 in Q3 2021. The increase was primarily due to the increase in cash operating costs per ounce sold and was partly offset by lower sustaining capital expenditure.\nSustaining capital expenditures of $4.1 million in Q3 2022 and $13.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily underground development and equipment rebuilds. Growth capital expenditures of $4.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 included resource conversion drilling at Kokarpinar.\nOlympias\nOlympias produced 16,123 ounces of gold in Q3 2022, a 17% increase from 13,745 ounces in Q3 2021 and primarily reflected higher average gold grade. Lead and silver production also increased in Q3 2022 as compared to Q3 2021 as a result of higher average grades while zinc production decreased due to lower average grade and recovery rates. Transformation initiatives are on-going as the mine continues to ramp up productivity.\nRevenue increased to $44.6 million in Q3 2022 from $35.4 million in Q3 2021 primarily as a result of higher zinc sales volumes in the quarter due to timing of concentrate shipments. Revenue was also impacted during the quarter by the 13% VAT import charge levied on customers importing Olympias gold concentrate into China. This import charge, effective since October 1, 2021, reduces revenue by a corresponding amount. China was the primary destination of Olympias gold concentrate in 2022 as planned shipments to Russia were halted earlier in the year as a result of sanctions imposed on Russia due to the Russia-Ukraine war. However, shipments to alternative markets commenced in mid-2022 and continue to be explored. Revenue from gold concentrate sales increased slightly in the quarter in line with higher production and revenue from lead-silver concentrate sales decreased in the quarter due to timing of bulk shipments.\nProduction costs increased to $44.3 million in Q3 2022 from $27.3 million in Q3 2021 reflecting increased volumes of gold and zinc concentrate sold, combined with price increases in electricity, fuel, and other consumables. Cash operating costs per ounce sold increased to $1,466 in Q3 2022 from $952 in Q3 2021, primarily a result of certain production cost increases and the 13% VAT import charge which is included in cash operating costs. These increases were partly offset by higher gold grade and higher revenue from silver and base metal sales, which reduce cash operating costs as by-product credits. Electricity prices in the quarter rose 29% from Q2 2022 levels in line with escalating market prices, despite continued subsidies that lower the effective average price.\nAISC per ounce sold increased to $2,070 in Q3 2022 from $1,728 in Q3 2021 primarily due to the increase in cash operating costs per ounce sold and was partly offset by a decrease in sustaining capital expenditure.\nSustaining capital expenditures of $5.7 million in Q3 2022 and $19.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 primarily included underground development and expansion of tailings facilities. Growth capital expenditures of $1.2 million in Q3 2022 and $4.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 were primarily related to underground development.\nFor further information on the Company's operating results for the third quarter of 2022, please see the Company\u2019s MD&A filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com under the Company\u2019s profile.\nCorporate Update\nThe Company also announced today the appointment of Frank Herbert as Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer, effective January 1, 2023. Mr. Herbert joined Eldorado, on an interim basis in May 2022.

(\"Argonaut\" or \"Argonaut Gold\"). Forward-looking statements and forward-looking information include, but are not limited to statements with respect to the cost and timing of construction; permitting and legal processes in relation to mining permitting and approvals; estimated production and mine life of the various mineral projects of Argonaut; the ability to obtain permits for operations; synergies; the realization of mineral reserve estimates; the timing and amount of estimated future production; costs of production; the benefits of the development potential of the properties of Argonaut; the future price of gold, copper, and silver; the estimation of mineral reserves and resources; success of exploration activities; and currency exchange rate fluctuations. Except for statements of historical fact relating to Argonaut, certain information contained herein constitutes forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are frequently characterized by words such as \"plan,\" \"expect,\" \"project,\" \"intend,\" \"believe,\" \"anticipate\", \"estimate\" and other similar words, or statements that certain events or conditions \"may\", \"should\" or \"will\" occur. Forward-looking statements are based on the opinions and estimates of management at the date the statements are made and are based on a number of assumptions and subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Many of these assumptions are based on factors and events that are not within the control of Argonaut and there is no assurance they will prove to be correct.\nFactors that could cause actual results to vary materially from results anticipated by such forward-looking statements include supply chain resilience, inflation and other impacts on construction, variations in ore grade or recovery rates, changes in market conditions, risks relating to the availability and timeliness of permitting and governmental approvals; risks relating to international operations, fluctuating metal prices and currency exchange rates, changes in project parameters, the possibility of project cost overruns or unanticipated costs and expenses, labour disputes and other risks of the mining industry, failure of plant, equipment or processes to operate as anticipated.\nThese factors are discussed in greater detail in Argonaut's most recent Annual Information Form and in the most recent Management's Discussion and Analysis filed on SEDAR, which also provide additional general assumptions in connection with these statements. Argonaut cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not exhaustive. Investors and others who base themselves on forward-looking statements should carefully consider the above factors as well as the uncertainties they represent and the risk they entail. Argonaut believes that the expectations reflected in those forward-looking statements are reasonable, but no assurance can be given that these expectations will prove to be correct and such forward-looking statements included in this press release should not be unduly relied upon. These statements speak only as of the date of this press release.\nAlthough Argonaut has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to be anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Argonaut undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's estimates or opinions should change except as required by applicable securities laws. The reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Statements concerning mineral reserve and resource estimates may also be deemed to constitute forward-looking statements to the extent they involve estimates of the mineralization that will be encountered if the property is developed. Comparative market information is as of a date prior to the date of this document.\nFor more information, contact:\nArgonaut Gold Inc.\nJoanna Longo\nInvestor Relations\nPhone: 416 575 6965\nEmail: investor.relations@argonautgold.com\nSOURCE Argonaut Gold Inc.\nView original content to download multimedia: http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/October2022/27/c9463.html",

The Loulo district is still delivering high-quality targets and we\u2019re upgrading the complex\u2019s infrastructure to support both open pit pushbacks and extensions at Yalea and Gara. In the meantime, the new Gounkoto underground mine is progressing its development towards scheduled commencement of stoping next year,\u201d he said.\nBristow noted that Loulo-Gounkoto was an outstanding example of Barrick\u2019s policy of recruiting and developing the people of its host countries. Malian nationals account for 95% of the complex\u2019s workforce and they are led by an all-Malian management team. Similarly, it has invested in the growth of local business partners, ranging from key contractors to fuel and lubricant suppliers. In the year to date, it has spent $395 million with these partners, representing 80% of its total purchases.\nLoulo-Gounkoto has also significantly improved the quality of life in its surrounding communities through its investment in projects designed to provide them with access to healthcare, education, food security and potable water. An ongoing program to train local entrepreneurs in business development has been initiated, with the first cohort recently graduating.\nMalaria remains one of Africa\u2019s biggest health problems and Loulo-Gounkoto is taking aggressive action to reverse the recent rise in the infection rate after a long period in which it steadily decreased.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements. The words \u201ccontinue\u201d, \u201con track\u201d, \u201ccommitment\u201d, \u201cvalue\u201d, \u201cguidance\u201d, and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. In particular, this press release contains forward-looking statements including, without limitation, with respect to: Loulo-Gounkoto\u2019s production guidance and performance; the potential for investments in exploration at Loulo-Gounkoto\u2019s to extend the life of mine; the anticipated benefits from infrastructure upgrades and the new Gounkoto underground mine; Barrick\u2019s commitment to recruiting and developing host country nationals at Loulo-Gounkoto; Barrick\u2019s commitment to Mali and investment in the development of local communities, including to support local procurement, employment, education and development programs, as well as to support efforts to reverse the recent rise in malaria infection rates.\nForward-looking statements are necessarily based upon a number of estimates and assumptions including material estimates and assumptions related to the factors set forth below that, while considered reasonable by the Company as at the date of this press release in light of management\u2019s experience and perception of current conditions and expected developments, are inherently subject to significant business, economic, and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. Known and unknown factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements, and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements and information. Such factors include, but are not limited to: fluctuations in the spot and forward price of gold, copper, or certain other commodities (such as silver, diesel fuel, natural gas, and electricity); the speculative nature of mineral exploration and development; changes in mineral production performance, exploitation, and exploration successes; the possibility that future exploration results will not be consistent with the Company\u2019s expectations; risks that exploration data may be incomplete and considerable additional work may be required to complete further evaluation, including but not limited to drilling, engineering and socioeconomic studies and investment; risk of loss due to acts of war, terrorism, sabotage and civil disturbances; risks associated with projects in the early stages of evaluation, and for which additional engineering and other analysis is required; failure to comply with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations; timing of receipt of, or failure to comply with, necessary permits and approvals; changes in national and local government legislation, taxation, controls or regulations and/ or changes in the administration of laws, policies and practices, expropriation or nationalization of property and political or economic developments in the Mali and other jurisdictions in which the Company or its affiliates do or may carry on business in the future; the impact of inflation, including global inflationary pressures; damage to the Company\u2019s reputation due to the actual or perceived occurrence of any number of events, including negative publicity with respect to the Company\u2019s handling of environmental matters or dealings with community groups, whether true or not; risks associated with new diseases, epidemics and pandemics, including the effects and potential effects of the global Covid-19 pandemic; litigation and legal and administrative proceedings; employee relations including loss of key employees; increased costs and physical risks, including extreme weather events and resource shortages, related to climate change; and availability and increased costs associated with mining inputs and labor. Barrick also cautions that its guidance may be impacted by the unprecedented business and social disruption caused by the spread of Covid-19. In addition, there are risks and hazards associated with the business of mineral exploration, development and mining, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected formations, pressures, cave-ins, flooding and gold bullion, copper cathode or gold or copper concentrate losses (and the risk of inadequate insurance, or inability to obtain insurance, to cover these risks).\nMany of these uncertainties and contingencies can affect our actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, us. Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. All of the forward-looking statements made in this press release are qualified by these cautionary statements. Specific reference is made to the most recent Form 40-F/Annual Information Form on file with the SEC and Canadian provincial securities regulatory authorities for a more detailed discussion of some of the factors underlying forward-looking statements and the risks that may affect Barrick\u2019s ability to achieve the expectations set forth in the forward-looking statements contained in this press release.\nBarrick disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.",

Closes 100% Acquisition of the Carp River Nickel-Copper-Cobalt Claims in Saskatchewan\n- Oops!Something went wrong.Please try again later.\n- SKKRF\nVANCOUVER, BC, Nov. 1, 2022 /CNW/ - SKRR Exploration Inc. (TSXV: SKRR) (FSE: B04Q) (\"SKRR\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that it has received final approval from the TSX Venture Exchange (the \"Exchange\") for the previously announced non-arm's length acquisition agreement dated October 24, 2022 (the \"Acquisition Agreement\") to acquire a 100% interest in Edge Geological Consulting Inc.'s (\"Edge\") Carp River property (the \"Property\") consisting of five (5) mineral claims compromising a total of 5,606.48 hectares.\nTerms of the Acquisition Agreements\nUnder the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, SKRR acquired a 100% interest in the Property by making a cash payment of C$7,000 to Edge (which represents the costs expended by Edge in staking and researching the Property) upon Exchange final approval of the Acquisition Agreement.\nThe Acquisition Agreement with Edge is not an \"Arm's Length Transaction\" as such term is defined in the Exchange's Policy 1.1 and therefore constituted a \"related party transaction\" as such term is defined in Multilateral Instrument 61-101 \u00e3 Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions. Ross McElroy is a director of SKRR and is also a director of Edge.\nThe Carp River Nickel-Copper Property Details\nThe Carp River property comprised of five (5) contiguous mineral claims totaling 5,606.48 ha., is located immediately north of the hamlet of Stony Rapids in the province of Saskatchewan. Stony Rapids is a full service community with a commercial airport. Access to the Property is via fixed wing or helicopter aircraft. From a regional perspective, the property lies within the Tantato Domain, which makes up part of the significant Snowbird Tectonic Zone. Regionally, bedrock consists primarily of mafic granulite and garnet-pyroxene diatexite formations, which extend on strike to the west towards the Axis Lake and Rea Lake Ni-Cu-Co deposits and the Currie Lake occurrences located within 5km to 10km to the west of Carp River.\nHistoric exploration by Red Dragon and Pure Nickel Inc. in 2005 included a regional airborne VTEM (Versatile Time Domain Electromagnetic) geophysics survey which covered the known Axis Lake, Rea Lake, Currie Lake and other showings. Interpretation of the 2005 VTEM survey, picked numerous highly rated VTEM anomalies over the Carp River property. Follow-up soil grid surveys were conducted over areas where they determined that the conductors looked prospective. Red Dragon and Pure Nickel determined that the Ni-Cu-Co anomalies became more intense close to nickeliferous norite bodies. One of those grids surveyed was the Carp River grid, located in the middle of the Carp River property, where soil results were significant and comparable to those around Axis Lake and Currie Lake occurrences.\nSKRR cautions that some of the historical results were collected and reported by past operators and have not been verified nor confirmed by a Qualified Person, but form a basis for future work on the Carp River Property. Mineralization hosted on nearby properties is not necessarily indicative of mineralization that may be hosted on the Carp River Property.\nQualified Person\nThe scientific and technical information contained in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Ross McElroy P.Geo, a director of the Company and a \"Qualified Person\" as defined in National Instrument 43-101 \u00e3 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects. Mr. McElroy verified the data disclosed (unless indicated otherwise) which includes a review of the sampling, analytical and test data underlying the information and opinions contained therein.\nAbout SKRR Exploration Inc.:\nSKRR is a Canadian-based precious mineral exploration company with properties in Saskatchewan - one of the world's highest ranked mining jurisdictions. The primary exploration focus is on the Trans-Hudson Corridor in Saskatchewan in search of world class deposits. The Trans-Hudson Orogen - although extremely well known in geological terms has been significantly under-explored in Saskatchewan. SKRR is committed to all stakeholders including shareholders, all its partners and the environment in which it operates.\nON BEHALF OF THE BOARD\nSherman Dahl\nPresident & CEO\nTel: 250-558-8340\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nForward-Looking Information\nThis news release contains \"forward\u00e3looking information or statements\" within the meaning of applicable securities laws, which may include, without limitation, statements that address future work on the Carp River Property, other statements relating to the technical, financial and business prospects of the Company, its projects and other matters.

The Company has made the purchase from Bulawayo Mining Company Limited, a privately owned UK company. The purchase price is undisclosed but is below the regulatory disclosure threshold.\nHighlights\nCaledonia considers Motapa to be highly prospective and strategically important to its growth ambitions in Zimbabwe in terms of both location and scale.\nMotapa is a large exploration property which is contiguous to the Bilboes gold project in respect of which Caledonia announced that it had entered into a binding sale and purchase agreement in July 2022.\nThe Project was formerly owned and explored by Anglo American Zimbabwe prior to its exit from the Zimbabwean gold sector in the late 1990s. The Project is approximately 75km north of Bulawayo with a mining lease covering approximately 2,200 hectares.\nThe Motapa asset has been mined throughout most of the second half of the 20th century, Caledonia Mining understands that during this period the region produced as much as 300,000oz of gold. Whilst none of the mining infrastructure remains, the evidence of historical mining will provide guidance to our exploration team in best understanding the prospectivity of the region.\nCommenting on the acquisition, Mark Learmonth, Chief Executive Officer, said:\n\u201cWe are pleased to have concluded the purchase of Motapa. Given its large scale, excellent geological prospectivity and its strategic location adjacent to Bilboes, Motapa was a high priority acquisition for Caledonia. We look forward to developing an exploration program for Motapa as we target a large-scale gold belt surrounding the Bilboes project.\n\u201cWith the central shaft at Blanket now fully operational and production targeting 80,000 ounces of gold per year1 we anticipate that we will deploy the incremental cash flow arising from Blanket into our exciting exploration and project development portfolio in Zimbabwe.\n\u201cThe acquisition of Motapa following the signing of a sale and purchase agreement to acquire Bilboes and the acquisition of Maligreen demonstrates that over the last 12 months Caledonia has established a pipeline of high-quality exploration and development projects. This is in addition to the potential for further growth at Blanket where we are optimistic about its exploration potential.\u201d\nThe image below illustrates the location of Motapa in comparison to the Bilboes project:\nNote: The information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information under the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014(\u201cMAR\u201d)as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018and is disclosed in accordance with the Company's obligations under Article 17 of MAR.\nCautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Information Information and statements contained in this news release that are not historical facts are \u201cforward-looking information\u201d within the meaning of applicable securities legislation that involve risks and uncertainties relating, but not limited, to Caledonia\u2019s current expectations, intentions, plans, and beliefs.

(TSX: PAAS) (Nasdaq: PAAS) (\"Pan American\") and Agnico Eagle Limited (TSX: AEM) (NYSE: AEM) (\"Agnico Eagle\") are pleased to announce that we have delivered a definitive binding offer (the \"Binding Offer\") to the board of directors of Yamana Gold Inc. (\"Yamana\") pursuant to which Pan American would acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Yamana (the \"Yamana Shares\") and Yamana would sell certain subsidiaries and partnerships which hold Yamana's interests in its Canadian assets to Agnico Eagle, including the Canadian Malartic mine. The transaction shall be implemented by way of a plan of arrangement under the Canada Business Corporations Act (the \"Arrangement\").\nThe consideration consists of 153,539,579 common shares in the capital of Pan American (\"Pan American Shares\"); US$1.0 billion in cash contributed by Agnico Eagle; and 36,089,907 common shares in the capital of Agnico Eagle (\"Agnico Eagle Shares\"). Under the Binding Offer, each Yamana Share would be exchanged for approximately US$1.04 in cash, 0.1598 Pan American Shares and 0.0376 Agnico Eagle Shares, for an aggregate value of US$5.02 per Yamana Share based on the closing price of each Pan American Share and Agnico Eagle Share on November 3, 2022. The Binding Offer is not subject to any financing condition or additional due diligence.\nPan American and Agnico Eagle have been informed that Yamana's Board of Directors, in consultation with Yamana's financial and legal advisors, have determined that the Binding Offer constitutes a \"Yamana Superior Proposal\" as defined in the arrangement agreement dated May 31, 2022 (the \"Gold Fields Agreement\") between Yamana and Gold Fields Limited (\"Gold Fields\") and that Yamana has notified Gold Fields of its intention to accept the Binding Offer, subject only to Gold Fields' \"right to match\" under the Gold Fields Agreement.\nThe Arrangement would establish Pan American as a major precious metals producer in Latin America, with approximately 28.5 to 30.0 million ounces of annual silver production and approximately 1.1 to 1.2 million ounces of annual gold production, based on Pan American's and Yamana's 2022 guidance. The combined portfolio will consist of 12 operations concentrated in Latin America, a region where Pan American has over 28 years of proven expertise and experience operating mines. With the addition of four operating mines generating strong free cash flow, the Arrangement is expected to enhance Pan American's overall financial position and improve its ability to internally fund its growth projects.\nThe consolidation of the Canadian Malartic mine would place a world-class asset into the hands of the best positioned operator to develop the mine's full potential and gives Agnico Eagle operational control during the remaining development period of the Odyssey project and future projects. Most importantly, Agnico Eagle has the unique ability to monetize future additional mill capacity at the Canadian Malartic mine, given its extensive operations and strategic land position in the region.\nPan American's unparalleled track record in Latin America and Agnico Eagle's deep existing knowledge of the Canadian Malartic mine and presence in the Abitibi region uniquely position the two companies to effectively operate and rapidly unlock further value from Yamana's portfolio of assets to the benefit of the shareholders and other stakeholders of all three companies.\nMichael Steinmann, President & CEO of Pan American, commented: \"The combination of our existing portfolio with Yamana's high-quality assets in Latin America would create a powerful precious metals mining company in the Americas with leading exposure to silver, and represents an exciting opportunity for growth for both Yamana and Pan American shareholders. The transaction is aligned with our disciplined approach of creating shareholder value through accretive acquisitions, together with our expertise in discovering, building and operating mines. Our established presence and expertise in Latin America will enable us to leverage the synergies and growth potential of Yamana's assets in the region in a way that is highly complementary to Pan American's existing mines there.\"\nAmmar Al-Joundi, President & CEO of Agnico Eagle, added: \"This transaction is a continuation of Agnico Eagle's strategy to operate in regions where we believe we have a competitive advantage, in this case over 50 years of operating history. The full integration of the Canadian Malartic team and landholdings into our operational base in the region would enhance our Abitibi operating platform, placing Agnico in the unique position to further optimize the asset and unlock potential value through exploration and the leveraging of existing infrastructure, people and regional relationships.\"\nAgnico Eagle and Pan American are subject to customary restrictions in connection with making a \"superior proposal\" for Yamana. As a result, Agnico Eagle and Pan American are unable to make any further comment on the subject matter of this press release or engage in any communication that could influence the voting of securities of Yamana. Accordingly, we will not be hosting a conference call or investor meetings and cannot respond to media or other inquiries at this time. As soon as Agnico Eagle and Pan American are legally permitted to do so, they will actively engage with shareholders and other stakeholders to discuss the transaction. |\nStrategic Rationale for Pan American and Agnico Eagle\nThe acquisition of Yamana by Pan American and Agnico Eagle would create significant value and deliver multiple benefits to Pan American's and Agnico Eagle's shareholders:\nTransforms Pan American into a major precious metals producer in Latin America with unparalleled exposure to silver through further portfolio diversification \u2013 Yamana's portfolio of assets in Latin America complements and strengthens Pan American's existing portfolio in the region, including by contributing low-cost production growth and long-life mineral reserves. The Arrangement will result in a portfolio of 12 operating mines and is estimated to increase silver production by approximately 50% and gold production by approximately 100%. In addition, Pan American would have an enlarged pipeline of potential growth projects in Latin America. Pan American has 28 years of proven expertise and experience building and operating mines in Latin America, making it well suited to realize more value from Yamana's mines in this region.\nConsolidation of 100% ownership of the Canadian Malartic mine \u2013 Agnico Eagle currently holds a 50% joint venture interest in the Canadian Malartic mine, which it operates with Yamana through a joint management committee. Agnico Eagle has significant technical experience with the mine and is the best operator to unlock potential value for shareholders. In addition, Agnico Eagle is uniquely positioned to monetize future additional mill capacity at the Canadian Malartic mine, given its extensive operations and strategic land position in the region.\nOperational and Administrative Synergies \u2013 The Binding Offer presents multiple opportunities for operational and administrative synergies, particularly between Pan American's and Yamana's corporate offices in Canada, as well as at Agnico Eagle's and Yamana's Canadian Malartic mine in Canada and at Agnico Eagle's other operations in the region.\nStrengthened platform for ongoing sustainable development \u2013 Pan American and Agnico Eagle are committed to continuing to deliver best-in-class ESG performance and will bring their approach and values to the portfolio of assets.\nLow execution risk \u2013 The proposed transaction between Yamana, Pan American and Agnico Eagle would not require review and approvals under the Investment Canada Act. Moreover, only a simple majority of Pan American shareholders would be required to approve the Arrangement.\nKey Benefits\nThe Binding Offer would offer the following key benefits:\nIncreased Value per Yamana Share\nAggregate consideration with a value of US$4.8 billion, or US$5.02 per Yamana Share, based on the closing price of the Pan American Shares and Agnico Eagle Shares on November 3, 2022;\ntotal premium to Yamana of 23% to its spot price as of market close on November 3, 2022; and\npremium to the implied price of the initial offer delivered by Gold Fields of 15%, based on the spot price of Gold Fields shares as of market close on November 3, 2022.\nAttractive Consideration\nConsideration to Yamana shareholders comprised of (i) US$1.0 billion in cash; (ii) approximately 153.5 million Pan American Shares; and (iii) approximately 36.1 million Agnico Eagle Shares;\na rollover for Pan American Shares issued to Yamana shareholders resident in Canada; and\na distribution of Agnico Eagle Shares and cash on a tax efficient reorganization of capital.\nExposure to World Class Assets through Ownership in Pan American and Agnico Eagle\nPan American:\nExposure to Pan American's expertise and experience in operating mines in Latin America for over 28 years;\ndiversification of Yamana's current Latin American portfolio through exposure to Pan American's existing portfolio of eight producing mines in Mexico, Peru, Argentina and Bolivia;\nexposure to the potential reopening of Pan American's 100% owned Escobal mine, one of the world's premier silver deposits with past production of over 20 million ounces of silver per year, as Guatemala's Ministry of Energy and Mines concludes a court mandated ILO 169 consultation process; and\nenlarged growth pipeline with exposure to Pan American's La Colorada Skarn project in Mexico and the undeveloped Navidad silver deposit in Argentina.\nAgnico Eagle:\nExposure to Agnico Eagle's world class portfolio of producing mines in Canada, Australia, Finland and Mexico; and\ncontinued exposure to Agnico Eagle's expertise in operating the Canadian Malartic mine in Canada with 100% consolidation of Canadian Malartic ownership, including: (i) substantial expected future additional mill capacity at Canadian Malartic that Agnico Eagle is uniquely positioned to fill given its extensive operations and land position in the region; and (ii) Agnico Eagle is best able to develop, build and operate Wasamac given its extensive experience and expertise and infrastructure in the region.\nTransaction has low Execution Risk\nSimple majority approval (i.e. 50%+1) for Pan American shareholder approval;\nno Agnico Eagle shareholder approval required; and\nno review of the proposed transaction under the Investment Canada Act.\nAgnico Eagle Investment in Pan American\nIn furtherance of its relationship with Pan American and as evidence of its belief in the opportunity for enhancement arising from the combination of Yamana and Pan American's Latin American portfolios, Agnico Eagle intends to purchase as a strategic investment, in the open market up to US$150 million of Pan American shares. Agnico Eagle's decision to make purchases of Pan American shares will be in its discretion and will be subject to market conditions, the price of Pan American shares and applicable securities law and stock exchange requirements. Agnico Eagle may cease making share purchases at any time.\nManagement Integration\nPan American will work cooperatively with Yamana to determine the integration of Yamana management into the management team of Pan American on or prior to the closing of the Arrangement. Pan American will establish a transitionary integration period in which the Toronto office employees of Yamana will support Pan American to integrate and manage the business and operations of Yamana. Those at a Senior Vice President level and below at Yamana will be approached to continue to support the management of the business during this transitionary period or longer, as may be required by Pan American.\nPan American and Agnico Eagle's Binding Offer\nUnder the Binding Offer, each Yamana Share would be exchanged for approximately US$1.04 in cash, 0.1598 Pan American Shares and 0.0376 Agnico Eagle Shares, for an aggregate value of US$5.02 per Yamana Share. In addition, all outstanding restricted stock units of Yamana will be satisfied in cash.\nThe Arrangement contemplated under the Binding Offer will be implemented by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement under the Canada Business Corporations Act and will require the approval of 66 2/3% of the votes cast by the holders of Yamana's common shares present in person or represented by proxy at a special meeting to consider the Arrangement. The completion of the Arrangement will also require approval of a simple majority of Pan American shareholders at a special meeting.\nThe completion of the Arrangement will also be subject to regulatory approvals and closing conditions customary in transactions of this nature. The agreement governing the Arrangement (the \"Arrangement Agreement\") will provide for customary deal-protection provisions, including mutual non-solicitation covenants and rights to match superior proposals. The Arrangement Agreement will include a reciprocal termination fee of US$250 million, payable by Yamana to Pan American, or US$375 million payable from Pan American to Yamana, as the case may be, under certain circumstances.\nThe Arrangement would close late in the first quarter of 2023.\nAt closing, existing Pan American and Yamana shareholders would own approximately 58% and 42% of Pan American, respectively. Similarly, at closing, existing Agnico Eagle and Yamana shareholders would own approximately 93% and 7% of Agnico Eagle, respectively.\nNone of the securities to be issued pursuant to the Arrangement Agreement have been or will be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"U.S. Securities Act\"), or any state securities laws, and any securities issued in the Arrangement are anticipated to be issued in reliance upon available exemptions from such registration requirements pursuant to Section 3(a)(10) of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable exemptions under state securities laws. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities.\nGold Fields Right to Match\nPan American and Agnico Eagle have been advised by Yamana that it has provided notice of the Binding Offer to Gold Fields as required by the Gold Fields Agreement and has advised Gold Fields that the five business day matching period (the \"Gold Fields Response Period\") has commenced, during which Gold Fields has the right, but not the obligation, to propose to amend the terms of the Gold Fields Agreement for the Binding Offer to cease to be a Yamana Superior Proposal (the \"Match Right\"). The Gold Fields Response Period expires on November 15, 2022. Under the Gold Fields Agreement, the Binding Offer may be accepted and the Arrangement Agreement entered into between Pan American, Agnico Eagle and Yamana only upon the expiry or waiver by Gold Fields of the Match Right during the Gold Fields Response Period. The Arrangement Agreement would only become effective upon the Gold Fields Agreement not being approved by Yamana Shareholders at the Yamana special meeting scheduled for November 21, 2022 (the \"Activation Date\"). Upon termination of the Gold Fields Agreement in these circumstances, Yamana would pay a termination fee of US$300 million to Gold Fields within two business days of such termination.\nPan American currently does not own any Yamana Shares. Agnico Eagle currently owns 70,565 Yamana Shares, representing less than 1% of the issued and outstanding shares of Yamana.\nAt this time, there can be no assurance that the Binding Offer will lead to a termination of the Gold Fields Agreement and the execution of a definitive Arrangement Agreement with Pan American and Agnico Eagle.\nAdvisors and Counsel\nBMO Capital Markets and GenCap Mining Advisory Ltd. are acting as financial advisors to Pan American in connection with the Binding Offer. BMO Capital Markets and National Bank Financial have each provided a fairness opinion to Pan American's Board of Directors.

(TSX: LUG) (Nasdaq Stockholm: LUG) (OTCQX: LUGDF) (\"Lundin Gold\" or the \"Company\") today reports results for the third quarter of 2022, highlighted by Q3 production of 121,635 ounces (\"oz\") of gold and sales of 134,640 oz at a cash operating cost1 of $656 per oz sold and all-in sustaining cost (\"AISC\")1 of $807 per oz sold.

All amounts are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated. PDF version.\nIn the third quarter, Lundin Gold generated net revenues of $210 million, adjusted earnings1 of $20.4 million and free cash flow1 of $65.2 million, resulting in a cash balance of $304 million at quarter end. With operations at Fruta del Norte (\"FDN\") generating sizeable free cash flow and considering the Company's existing cash balance, Lundin Gold paid an inaugural semi-annual dividend of $0.20 per share on September 13, 2022 (September 15 for shares trading on Nasdaq Stockholm) based on a record date of August 24, 2022. Under its recently established dividend policy, Lundin Gold anticipates continuing to pay dividends of at least $0.40 per share annually, equivalent to approximately $100 million, based on current gold prices, expected production levels, and current issued and outstanding shares.\nRon Hochstein, President and CEO of Lundin Gold commented, \"Once again, I am pleased to report another fantastic quarter for Lundin Gold. We continue to strive for operational excellence at Fruta del Norte, and remain focused on further optimization, improved efficiencies and lowering costs. Now that the South Ventilation Raise is complete, we will have more flexibility to mine on all levels, allowing us to continue generating strong results. Payment of our first dividend was a great milestone, and we see potential to create further shareholder value through the significant free cash flow we are generating from this tier one asset. With this cash flow we will continue to evaluate restructuring and paying down our debt, funding exploration, evaluating throughput expansion and M&A opportunities.\"\n____________________________________ |\n1 Certain additional disclosures for these specified financial measures have been incorporated by reference and can be found on pages 13 to 16 of the Company's MD&A for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 available on SEDAR. |\nThird Quarter of 2022 Financial Overview\nThe Company sold a total of 134,640 oz of gold, consisting of 88,083 oz of concentrate and 46,557 oz of dor\u00e9 at an average realized gold price1 of $1,618 per oz for total gross revenues from gold sales of $218 million. Net of treatment and refining charges, revenues were $210 million. As a result of the recent decline in the gold price, revenues from concentrate sales reflect a gold price adjustment of $10.8 million for sales whose provisional gold price is settled after quarter end. This adjustment is estimated using the forward gold price at quarter end for the expected month of settlement of each individual sale.\nCash operating costs1 and AISC1 were $656 and $807 per oz of gold sold, respectively. Sustaining capital is expected to remain high in the last quarter of the year due to the ongoing construction of the third tailings dam raise and other site infrastructure projects.\nIncome from mining operations was $83.9 million. The Company generated cash flow of $105 million from operations and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $304 million. Free cash flow1 for the quarter was $65.2 million or $0.28 per share.\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization1 (\"EBITDA\") and adjusted EBITDA1 were $159 million and $117 million, respectively. The difference is the derivative gain of $41.8 million in the quarter.\nNet income was $62.7 million including a derivative gain of $41.8 million, and net of corporate, exploration, finance costs, and associated taxes on earnings. Adjusted earnings1, which exclude derivative gains, were $20.4 million, or $0.09 per share. Net income was positively impacted by the recording of gold sales from the delay of shipments of gold concentrate from the second quarter, offset by the lower gold price realized on sales in Q3 2022.\nWhile quarterly revenues were affected by the declining gold price, they were positively impacted by the sale of additional ounces produced late in the second quarter but not shipped and sold until the third quarter. This was due to blockades on some of Ecuador's major highways during a national strike in the country, which ended on June 30th and resulted in a positive impact on revenues, income from mining operations, earnings, and cash flow in Q3 2022.\nThird Quarter of 2022 Production Overview\nMine production was 377,921 tonnes of ore at an average grade of 12.4 grams per tonne. Consistent with the previous quarter, efforts are underway to reduce the ore stockpile in order to minimize future potential oxidization of ore as it affects mill recoveries.\nThe mill processed 379,258 tonnes of ore at an average throughput rate of 4,122 tpd, slightly below design capacity due to an earlier than planned SAG and ball mill re-lining completed in late September.\nThe average grade of ore milled was 11.0 grams per tonne with average recovery at 90.3%. Recoveries in the third quarter were positively impacted by the higher grade and improved blending strategies put in place to reduce the impact of oxidized ore.\nGold production was 121,635 oz, comprised of 81,607 oz of concentrate and 40,028 oz of dor\u00e9.\nThird Quarter of 2022 Operating and Financial Highlights\nThe following two tables provide an overview of key operating and financial results during the third quarter and first nine months of 2022.\n________________________________ |\n1 Certain additional disclosures for these specified financial measures have been incorporated by reference and can be found on pages 13 to 16 of the Company's MD&A for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 available on SEDAR. |\nThree months ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, | |||\n2022 | 2021 | 2022 | 2021 | |\nTonnes ore mined | 377,921 | 382,667 | 1,126,980 | 1,145,778 |\nTonnes ore milled | 379,258 | 365,316 | 1,138,340 | 1,036,468 |\nAverage head grade (g/t) | 11.0 | 10.3 | 10.9 | 10.9 |\nAverage recovery | 90.3 % | 88.8 % | 89.4 % | 88.2 % |\nAverage mill throughput (tpd) | 4,122 | 3,971 | 4,170 | 3,797 |\nGold ounces produced | 121,635 | 107,663 | 355,190 | 320,599 |\nGold ounces sold | 134,640 | 111,605 | 350,213 | 318,822 |\nThree months ended September 30, | Nine months ended September 30, | |||\n2022 | 2021 | 2022 | 2021 | |\nNet revenues ($'000) | 210,425 | 190,753 | 604,705 | 546,889 |\nIncome from mining operations ($'000) | 83,930 | 89,431 | 277,659 | 264,066 |\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ($'000)1 | 158,876 | 112,832 | 402,386 | 352,475 |\nAdjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ($'000)1 | 117,038 | 113,468 | 355,286 | 327,187 |\nNet income ($'000) | 62,673 | 56,673 | 141,817 | 192,637 |\nFree cash flow ($'000)1 | 65,202 | 47,114 | 178,256 | 193,689 |\nAverage realized gold price ($/oz sold)1 | 1,618 | 1,769 | 1,781 | 1,770 |\nCash operating cost ($/oz sold)1 | 656 | 650 | 656 | 635 |\nAll-in sustaining costs ($/oz sold)1 | 807 | 804 | 785 | 778 |\nFree cash flow per share ($)1 | 0.28 | 0.20 | 0.76 | 0.84 |\nAdjusted net earnings ($'000)1 | 20,379 | 58,796 | 91,419 | 171,005 |\nAdjusted net earnings per share ($)1 | 0.09 | 0.25 | 0.39 | 0.74 |\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt the end of the third quarter of 2022, the Company is in a strong financial position.\n(in thousands of U.S. dollars) | As at September 30, 2022 | As at December 31, 2021 |\nFinancial Position: | ||\nCash | 303,639 | 262,608 |\nWorking capital | 253,673 | 217,221 |\nTotal assets | 1,634,590 | 1,685,113 |\nLong-term debt | 589,919 | 739,977 |\nAs at September 30, 2022, the Company had cash of $304 million and a working capital balance of $254 million compared to cash of $263 million and a working capital balance of $217 million at December 31, 2021. The change in cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was primarily due to cash generated from operating activities of $293 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options, warrants, and anti-dilution rights of $9.4 million. This is offset by principal repayments, interest, and finance charges, including associated taxes, under the gold prepay and stream credit facilities totaling $89.1 million, interest and principal repayments under the senior debt of $72.5 million, dividends of $47.0 million and cash outflows of $44.6 million for capital expenditures, which include costs for the South Ventilation Raise (\"SVR\") and sustaining capital.\n______________________________ |\n1 Certain additional disclosures for these specified financial measures have been incorporated by reference and can be found on pages 13 to 16 of the Company's MD&A for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 available on SEDAR. |\nThe Company's strong operating cash flow during the first nine months of 2022 is expected to continue for the remainder of the year based on its production and AISC guidance. This strong operating cash flow will continue to support aggressive debt repayments, regional and near mine exploration, conversion drilling at FDN, planned capital expenditures, growth initiatives and regular dividend payments under the dividend policy approved in the second quarter of this year.\nCapital Expenditures\nSouth Ventilation Raise: Following the end of the quarter, Lundin Gold announced that the SVR at Fruta del Norte is now complete and operational. As a result of the completion of the SVR, ventilation in the mine will increase from 180 m3/s to 350 m3/s resulting in improved efficiencies and enabling mining activities on all levels.\nSustaining Capital: The third raise of the tailings dam started during the second quarter, continued in the third, and construction is anticipated to be completed in Q4. Conversion drilling at Fruta del Norte is now complete for 2022, and final results were received during the quarter. The results of the 18,341 metre conversion drilling campaign will provide a significant improvement in the current deposit geological model by enabling better delineation of the distribution of and controls on higher grade mineralized zones within the known resource. A new resource model is underway, and the Company anticipates updating its estimates of Mineral Resources and Reserves at Fruta del Norte before the end of Q1 2023. Expenditures for other sustaining capital projects, such as construction of a new warehouse and improvements in the sewage treatment plants, will ramp up during the remainder of the year.\nHealth and Safety\nWith the Company's success in facilitating the provision of COVID-19 vaccines to its workforce and sub-contractor personnel, including booster shots, COVID-19 protocols have been essentially eliminated. Through vaccination campaigns by Ecuador's Ministry of Public Health, 100% of the Company's employees and on-site contractors were vaccinated and, as at September 30, 2022, 97.8% had received at least one booster shot.\nDuring the quarter there was one Lost Time Incident and no Medical Aid Incidents. The Total Recordable Incident Rate was 0.33 per 200,000 hours worked during the nine months ended September 30, 2022.\nCommunity\nVarious community projects supported by the Company are under way, including sponsoring the establishment of micro businesses providing ancillary services to Fruta del Norte and the community, such as a textile manufacturer, fire extinguisher maintenance, and pest control. These are in addition to the ongoing projects such as road maintenance, education projects, and broader-based development, with a focus upon the agricultural sector and infrastructure challenges.\nThe Company continues to implement a range of initiatives. They include working with Shuar indigenous communities to promote improved agricultural practices, as well as the further development of a Shuar-owned company. Together with the NGO Junior Achievement Ecuador, efforts to prepare local students for the national high school exit exam (and thus access to post-secondary education) continue to show very strong results. Efforts to address social challenges in the local community have continued, for example through the ongoing implementation of after-school activities.\nExploration\nNear Mine Exploration Program\nThe Company's 2022 near mine exploration started in Q3 2022 with two rigs testing potential targets both at depth and to the south of Fruta del Norte. During the third quarter of 2022, a total of 3,936 metres were drilled across eight holes.\n1,953 metres were completed across five underground drill holes testing FDN's continuity at depth in the southern portion of the mine. All the holes intercepted similar hydrothermal alteration zones consistent with the Fruta del Norte deposit (silicification, chalcedony and marcasite, veins, and veinlets or breccias), with different intensities and thickness.\n1,983 metres were completed across three surface drill holes to test the southern continuity of the main controlling structures of the Fruta del Norte deposit. Drilling intercepted a wide zone of intense hydrothermal alteration represented by silicification, chalcedony veins, pyrite and marcasite.\nResults are pending. Drilling is continuing with a third rig now added to test the east structure of Fruta del Norte.\nRegional Exploration Program\nThe Company's 2022 regional exploration continued on the Barbasco target and at new targets Capullo and Barbasco Norte with three drill rigs turning. During the third quarter of 2022, a total of 6,187 metres were drilled across nine holes, mainly at Barbasco and Capullo.\nTwo drill holes were completed at Barbasco Norte for a total of 1,327 metres to test a continuous geochemical gold soil anomaly at the edge of the Suarez Basin. Drilling intercepted a narrow hydrothermal alteration zone with quartz veins and illite-smectite-carbonate alteration, similar to that found in epithermal systems like Fruta del Norte.\nAt Barbasco, drilling continued to explore beneath the thick sequence of finely laminated silica on top of the volcanic rocks in the Santiago Formation, a proximal indicator of epithermal systems. Three drill holes were completed for a total of 2,700 metres with limited hydrothermal alteration intercepted.\nAt Capullo, a total of 2,159 metres were drilled across four holes. Drilling tested a major geological fault, associated with anomalous geochemical values for gold and epithermal pathfinder elements in rock samples. The first hole intersected a hydrothermal alteration zone containing a one meter breccia zone with silica, carbonate veinlets, enveloped by a wider 15 metre silica alteration with disseminated sulfides. Other follow up drill holes intersected narrower zones.\nResults are pending. Drilling is continuing with two drill rigs, one at Barbasco Norte and one to test other targets such as Capullo and Quebrada La Negra before the end of the year.\nNewcrest Earn-In Agreement\nNewcrest International Pty Ltd. (\"Newcrest\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Newcrest Mining Limited, met the first expenditure requirement of $4.0 million under the Earn-In Agreement covering eight of Lundin Gold's early-stage concessions to the north and south of Fruta del Norte and exercised its option to proceed to the second stage of the earn-in in Q2 2022. Through completion of the second stage, which requires the expenditure of a further $6.0 million, Newcrest would earn an initial 25% interest in the eight concessions indirectly through a subsidiary of Lundin Gold. Newcrest is advancing the planning of a new program focused on drill testing priority copper-gold porphyry targets which to date detected low-level porphyry style copper mineralization. Drilling is anticipated to restart in late Q4 2022.\nOutlook\nLundin Gold's strong performance in the first nine months of 2022 points to a strong overall result for the year. Management is confident that the Company's production will be at or near the high end of its guidance of 430,000 to 460,000 oz and at the low end of or slightly below its AISC1 guidance of $820 to $870 per oz gold sold.\nThe SVR, the last remaining scope of work under the original FDN construction project, was completed shortly after the end of the third quarter. As a result, ventilation in the mine will increase from 180 m3/s to 350 m3/s resulting in improved efficiencies and enabling mining activities on all levels.\nSustaining capital will continue to be high for the last quarter of 2022 with completion of construction of the third raise of the TSF and several other capital projects underway or planned for 2022.\nThe conversion drilling program at Fruta del Norte is now complete for 2022. All results were returned, data review and the design of a new geological model is underway and is planned to be completed in the last quarter of 2022. The Company is working on an update to its estimates of Mineral Resources and Reserves and anticipates filing an updated technical report prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 (\"NI 43-101\") for the Fruta del Norte deposit before the end of Q1 2023.\nThe regional and near mine exploration drill programs are continuing with a total of five rigs operating. Targets of interest on the regional program currently are Barbasco Norte, Capullo, Puma and Quebrada La Negra. Results are pending on drilling carried out during Q3 2022. Under the near mine drill program, one rig is operating underground to test extension of the deposit at depth and to the east and west of the current edges of the deposit. On surface, drilling is continuing to test potential mineralization along the structural trend to the south of FDN and a second surface rig will be moved from the regional program to test the east structure of Fruta del Norte.\nQualified Persons\nThe technical information relating to Fruta del Norte contained in this News Release has been reviewed and approved by Ron Hochstein P.

The Company\u2019s financial results are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\u201cIFRS\u201d). The reporting currency of the Company is the Canadian (\u201cCDN\u201d) Dollar.\nQUARTER HIGHLIGHTS\nFINANCIAL\nTotal revenue increased to $41.7 million in the September 2022 quarter compared to $37.1 million in the 2021 comparative quarter, an increase of $4.6 million.\nIn the September 2022 quarter, the Red Chris mine (100% basis) had 4.4 concentrate shipments (2021 - 4.0 concentrate shipments), and Mount Polley mine had 0.3 concentrate shipments (2021- nil concentrate shipments). Variations in revenue are impacted by the timing and quantity of concentrate shipments, metal prices and exchange rates, and period end revaluations of revenue attributed to concentrate shipments where copper and gold prices will settle at a future date.\nThe London Metals Exchange cash settlement copper price per pound averaged US$3.51 in the September 2022 quarter compared to US$4.25 in the 2021 comparative quarter. London Bullion Market Association, London gold price per troy ounce averaged US$1,729 in the September 2022 quarter compared to US$1,789 in the 2021 comparative quarter. The average US/CDN Dollar exchange rate was 1.306 in the September 2022 quarter, 3.6% higher than the exchange rate of 1.260 in the 2021 comparative quarter. In CDN Dollar terms the average copper price in the September 2022 quarter was CDN$4.59 per pound compared to CDN$5.36 per pound in the 2021 comparative quarter, and the average gold price in the September 2022 quarter was CDN$2,258 per ounce compared to CDN$2,254 per ounce in the 2021 comparative quarter.\nA negative revenue revaluation in the September 2022 quarter was $4.6 million as compared to a $0.8 million negative revenue revaluation in the 2021 comparative quarter. Revenue revaluations are the result of the metal price on the settlement date and/or the current period balance sheet date being higher or lower than when the revenue was initially recorded or the metal price at the last balance sheet date and finalization of contained metal as a result of final assays.\nNet loss for the September 2022 quarter was $27.9 million ($0.18 per share) compared to net loss of $3.8 million ($0.03 per share) in the 2021 comparative quarter. The increase in net loss of $24.1 million was primarily due to the following factors:\nMine operations went from an income of $4.9 million in September 2021 to a loss of $9.2 million in September 2022, increasing net loss by $14.1 million.\nMount Polley restart costs went from $1.6 million in September 2021 to $12.2 million in September 2022, increasing net loss by $10.6 million.\nIdle mine costs went from $6.2 million in September 2021 to $1.4 million in September 2022, decreasing net loss by $4.8 million.\nInterest expenses went from $0.2 million in September 2021 to $2.4 million in September 2022, increasing net loss by $2.2 million.\nCapital expenditures including finance leases were $41.2 million in the September 2022 quarter, an increase from $33.8 million in the 2021 comparative quarter. The September 2022 expenditures included $12.2 million in exploration, $15.0 million for tailings dam construction and $14.0 million on stripping costs and other capital.\nAt September 30, 2022, the Company had not hedged any copper, gold or US/CDN Dollar exchange. Quarterly revenues will fluctuate depending on copper and gold prices, the US/CDN Dollar exchange rate, and the timing of concentrate sales, which is dependent on concentrate production and the availability and scheduling of transportation.\nOPERATIONS\nThe current impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business is described under Significant Events and Liquidity in the Management\u2019s Discussion & Analysis. The Company\u2019s plans for 2022 and beyond could be adversely impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The continuing impact of COVID-19 could materially and adversely impact the Company\u2019s current plans by causing a temporary closure of the Red Chris mine, suspending planned exploration work, causing an economic slowdown resulting in a decrease in the demand for copper and gold, negatively impacting copper and gold prices, impacting the Company\u2019s ability to transport or market the Company\u2019s concentrate or causing disruptions in the Company\u2019s supply chains.\nRed Chris Mine\nRed Chris metal production (100% basis) for the third quarter of 2022 was 19.2 million pounds copper and 17,512 ounces gold, down by 13% and 10% respectively from the 22.0 million pounds copper and 19,540 ounces gold produced during the second quarter of 2022.\nGold production for the third quarter of 2022 was lower than the second quarter of 2022 due to lower recovery and lower throughput. Recovery is expected to improve in the December 2022 quarter with various improvement initiatives nearing completion including the cleaner column expansion project. Gold head grade was consistent with the second quarter of 2022. Copper production was down by 13% on lower throughput and grade. Mined grades for copper and gold are expected to decrease with mining now complete in Phase 5.\nImperial\u2019s 30% portion of Red Chris mine third quarter production was 5.8 million pounds copper and 5,254 ounces gold.\nThree Months Ended September 30*\nNine Months Ended September 30*\n2022\n2021\n2022\n2021\nOre milled -tonnes\n2,465,653\n2,543,495\n7,067,219\n7,199,572\nOre milled per calendar day -tonnes\n26,801\n27,647\n25,887\n26,372\nGrade % - copper\n0.446\n0.389\n0.449\n0.407\nGrade g/t - gold\n0.391\n0.336\n0.381\n0.365\nRecovery % - copper\n79.1\n79.0\n77.9\n78.5\nRecovery % - gold\n56.5\n55.6\n56.8\n55.1\nCopper -000\u2019s pounds\n19,181\n17,244\n54,497\n50,704\nGold -ounces\n17,512\n15,249\n49,140\n46,550\n* 100% Red Chris mine production\nDuring the third quarter of 2022, there were up to seven diamond drill rigs in operation. A further 20,926 metres of drilling has been completed from 27 drill holes, with all drill holes intersecting mineralization. Approximately 50,000 metres of drilling is planned for the second half of 2022 from eight drill rigs. Two of the rigs are drilling from underground stations along the exploration decline. Drilling from underground will reduce the meterage required to further test the East Ridge and the surface disturbance required to construct drill pads and roads.\nJim Miller-Tait, P.Geo. Vice President Exploration with Imperial Metals, is the designated Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101 for the Red Chris exploration program.\nImperial\u2019s 30% share of exploration, development, and capital expenditures were $31.2 million in the September 2022 quarter compared to $28.2 million in the 2021 comparative quarter.\nMount Polley Mine\nProduction at Mount Polley was 2.4 million pounds copper and 5,084 ounces gold for the third quarter of 2022. During this third quarter, 984,814 tonnes were milled. There has been a steady increase in throughput from 7,268 tonnes per day in July to 11,079 tonnes per day in August and 13,868 tonnes per day in September. Further increases in throughput were hampered by the trunnion machining that was required to repair Pebble Mill 3. This work is complete and Pebble Mill 3 was put into operation in early October. All eight mills in the grinding circuit are now operational, and we look forward to increasing the mill throughput.\nExploration, development, and capital expenditures in the September 2022 quarter were $8.1 million compared to $1.3 million in the 2021 comparative quarter.\nHuckleberry Mine\nHuckleberry operations ceased in August 2016 and the mine remains on care and maintenance status. The Company anticipates working towards the restart of Huckleberry following the start of operations at Mount Polley.\nSite personnel continue to focus on maintaining site access, water management (treatment and release of mine contact water into Tahtsa Reach), maintenance of site infrastructure and equipment, mine permit compliance, environmental compliance monitoring and monitoring tailings management facilities.\nGeotechnical programs conducted in 2021 have indicated that some work is required to upgrade the existing facility and provided information required to update the tailings facility design for future operations. A program of geotechnical and de-pressurization drilling has been completed and information collected is being assessed.\nFor the September 2022 quarter, Huckleberry incurred idle mine costs comprised of $1.2 million in operating costs and $0.2 million in depreciation expense.\nExploration, development, and capital expenditures in the September 2022 quarter were $1.8 million compared to $1.8 million in the 2021 comparative quarter.\nEARNINGS AND CASH FLOW\nSelect Quarter Financial Information\nexpressed in thousands of dollars, except share and per share amounts\nThree Months Ended\nNine Months Ended\nSeptember 30\nSeptember 30\n2022\n2021\n2022\n2021\nOperations:\nTotal revenues\n$41,688\n$37,064\n$111,197\n$104,329\nNet loss\n$(27,943)\n$(3,772)\n$(64,143)\n$(11,389)\nNet loss per share\n$(0.18)\n$(0.03)\n$(0.44)\n$(0.09)\nDiluted loss per share\n$(0.18)\n$(0.03)\n$(0.44)\n$(0.09)\nAdjusted net loss (1)\n$(27,990)\n$(3,489)\n$(76,450)\n$(11,165)\nAdjusted net loss per share (1)\n$(0.18)\n$(0.02)\n$(0.52)\n$(0.08)\nAdjusted EBITDA (1)\n$(13,035)\n$8,136\n$(49,365)\n$19,050\nCash earnings (1)(2)\n$(12,531)\n$7,780\n$(48,992)\n$18,408\nCash earnings per share (1)(2)\n$(0.08)\n$0.06\n$(0.33)\n$0.14\nWorking capital (deficiency) deficiency\n$(70,388)\n$21,950\n$(70,388)\n$21,950\nTotal assets\n$1,271,719\n$1,122,484\n$1,271,719\n$1,122,484\nTotal debt (including current portion) (3)\n$145,127\n$4,850\n$145,127\n$4,850\n(1) Refer to Non-IFRS Financial Measures for further details.\n(2) Cash earnings is defined as the cash flow from operations before the net change in non-cash working capital balances, income and mining taxes, and interest paid. Cash earnings per share is defined as cash earnings divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.\n(3) Total debt consists of banker\u2019s acceptances, convertible debentures, and equipment leases.\nNON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe Company reports four non-IFRS financial measures: adjusted net loss, adjusted EBITDA, cash earnings and cash cost per pound of copper produced which are described in detail below. The Company believes these measures are useful to investors because they are included in the measures that are used by management in assessing the financial performance of the Company.\nAdjusted net loss, adjusted EBITDA, cash earnings and cash cost per pound of copper are not standardized financial measures under IFRS and might not be comparable to similar financial measures disclosed by other issuers.\nAdjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Net Loss Per Share\nAdjusted net loss is derived from operating net loss by removing the gains or loss, resulting from acquisition and disposal of property, mark to market revaluation of derivative instruments not related to the current period, net of tax, unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses on non-current debt, net of tax and other non-recurring items. Adjusted net loss in the September 2022 quarter was $28.0 million ($0.18 per share) compared to an adjusted net loss of $3.5 million ($0.02 per share) in the 2021 comparative quarter. We believe that the presentation of adjusted net loss helps investors better understand the results of our normal operating activities and the ongoing cash generating potential of our business.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA in the September 2022 quarter was negative $13.0 million compared to positive $8.1 million in the 2021 comparative quarter. We define adjusted EBITDA as net loss before interest expense, taxes, depletion, and depreciation, and as adjusted for certain other items.\nWe believe that the presentation of adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain non-cash items and is useful to investors as an important indicator of our operations and the performance of our core business.\nCash Earnings and Cash Earnings Per Share\nCash earnings in the September 2022 quarter was negative $12.5 million compared to positive $7.8 million in the 2021 comparative quarter. Cash earnings per share was negative $0.08 in the September 2022 quarter compared to positive $0.06 in the 2021 comparative quarter.\nCash earnings and cash earnings per share are measures used by the Company to evaluate its performance however they are not terms recognized under IFRS. We believe that the presentation of cash earnings and cash earnings per share is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about how well the Company can earn cash to pay its debts and manage its operating expenses and investment. Cash earnings is defined as cash flow from operations before the net change in non-cash working capital balances, income and mining taxes paid, and interest paid. Cash earnings per share is the same measure divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year.\nCash Cost Per Pound of Copper Produced\nCompany is primarily a copper producer and therefore calculates this non-IFRS financial measure individually for its three copper mines, Red Chris (30% share), Mount Polley and Huckleberry, and on a composite basis for these mines.\nVariations from period to period in the cash cost per pound of copper produced are the result of many factors including: grade, metal recoveries, amount of stripping charged to operations, mine and mill operating conditions, labour and other cost inputs, transportation and warehousing costs, treatment and refining costs, the amount of by-product and other revenues, the US$ to CDN$ exchange rate and the amount of copper produced.\nIdle mine and mine restart costs during the periods when the Huckleberry and Mount Polley mines are not in operation have been excluded from the cash cost per pound of copper produced.\nexpressed in thousands, except cash cost per pound of copper produced\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2022\nRed Chris\nMount Polley(1)\nComposite\nCash cost of copper produced in US$\n$12,847\n$12,527\n$25,374\nCopper produced \u2013 pounds\n5,754\n2,420\n8,174\nCash cost per lb copper produced in US$\n$2.23\n$5.18\n$3.10\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2021\nRed Chris\nMount Polley(1)\nComposite\nCash cost of copper produced in US$\n$10,007\n$-\n$10,007\nCopper produced \u2013 pounds\n5,173\n-\n5,173\nCash cost per lb copper produced in US$\n$1.93\n$-\n$1.93\nexpressed in thousands, except cash cost per pound of copper produced\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2022\nRed Chris\nMount Polley(1)\nComposite\nCash cost of copper produced in US$\n$33,637\n$12,527\n$46,164\nCopper produced \u2013 pounds\n16,349\n2,420\n18,769\nCash cost per lb copper produced in US$\n$2.06\n$5.18\n$2.46\nNine Months Ended September 30, 2021\nRed Chris\nMount Polley(1)\nComposite\nCash cost of copper produced in US$\n$35,332\n$-\n$35,332\nCopper produced \u2013 pounds\n15,210\n-\n15,210\nCash cost per lb copper produced in US$\n$2.32\n$-\n$2.32\n(1) Mount Polley mine operations were suspended in May 2019, and the mine restarted operations in late June 2022.\nFor detailed information, refer to Imperial\u2019s 2022 Third Quarter Report available on imperialmetals.com and sedar.com\nAbout Imperial\nImperial is a Vancouver based exploration, mine development and operating company with holdings that include the Mount Polley mine (100%), the Huckleberry mine (100%), the Red Chris mine (30%).

(the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cTorex\u201d) (TSX: TXG)\nreports the Company\u2019s financial and operational results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. The Company will host a conference call tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM (ET) to discuss the results.\nJody Kuzenko, President & CEO of Torex, stated:\n\u201cOur well-established track record of delivering safe and reliable production at El Lim\u00f3n Guajes (\u201cELG\u201d) continues, with 122,208 ounces produced this quarter. With a sharp focus on cost management, we also generated healthy margins this quarter, resulting in adjusted EBITDA of $107.8 million and free cash flow of $33.5 million, including $68.6 million of capital expenditures. Given the year-to-date production and cost performance, we are well positioned to deliver on operational guidance for the fourth straight year.\n\u201cDe-risking our Media Luna Project continues to be central to our strategy. During the quarter, a major permitting milestone was achieved with the granting of the MIA Integral from the environmental regulator, which is the permit that will allow for operations to begin at Media Luna. Additionally, we secured approval from the utility authorities to increase our power draw to 45 megawatts, to accommodate activities on both the north and south sides of the Balsas River.\n\u201cProcurement on the project continues to ramp up responsibly, with a focus on key, long-lead packages that are schedule critical \u2013 including the Guajes conveyor, flotation circuits, re-grind mills, mine ventilation fans and the battery electric vehicle fleet. On the high volume, non-schedule critical procurement packages, we are seeing a rescheduling of cost flow estimates assumed in the 2022 Technical Report for several reasons, including extra time to expand the pool of vendors, extra time for the vendors to provide bids, as well as timing and quantum of staged payments that vary from the allocations initially assumed. Although timing of non-schedule critical procurement and cost flow estimates differ from those originally assumed, the overall lead times and upfront costs of purchase orders executed to date are substantially in line with the Technical Report.\n\u201cAs a result of the lower procurement spend to date, there will be an underrun in capital expenditures on the project for 2022, and guided annual spend is now in the range of $120 to $150 million. While these spend patterns have impacted the level invested to date, the pace of investment is expected to accelerate over the coming quarters, and the overall project schedule remains on track at this early stage.\n\u201cBeyond procurement, we continued to make steady progress on project engineering and construction in Q3. At quarter end, total physical completion stood at 9%, with steady momentum on engineering, surface construction and underground development activities. At the end of October, the Guajes Tunnel had advanced approximately 2,835 metres and South Portal Lower had advanced approximately 1,175 metres, meaning that projected breakthrough continues to track well for Q1 2024.\n\u201cOur strategy at Morelos continues to be executed per plan \u2013 with $339 million of cash on hand at quarter end, $250 million of available credit, and strong and consistent forecast cash flow from ELG, we are well positioned to fund the development of Media Luna, continue to invest in value enhancing exploration and drilling, and maintain minimum balance sheet liquidity of $100 million.\u201d\nTHIRD QUARTER 2022 HIGHLIGHTS\n-\nStrong safety performance continues: One lost-time injury in the quarter related to a finger pinch sustained by a contractor working on the Media Luna Project. The Company exited the quarter with a lost-time injury frequency (\u201cLTIF\u201d) rate of 0.10 per million hours worked on a rolling 12-month basis.\n-\nGold production: Produced 122,208 ounces of gold during the quarter. Gold production is tracking towards the upper end of the full year guided range of 430,000 to 470,000 ounces.\n-\nGold sold: Sold 119,834 ounces of gold at an average realized gold price1 of $1,715 per ounce, contributing to revenue of $209.3 million. The realized gold price was slightly lower than the benchmark price for the quarter given a higher portion of gold produced and sold in September.\n-\nTotal cash costs1 and all-in sustaining costs1: Total cash costs of $760 per ounce sold and all-in sustaining costs of $1,059 per ounce sold. The Company anticipates exiting the year at the high end of the guided range for total cash costs ($695 to $735 per ounce) and towards the mid-point of the guided range for all-in sustaining costs ($980 to $1,030 per ounce).\n-\nNet income and adjusted net earnings1: Reported net income of $43.9 million or earnings of $0.51 per share on a basic and diluted basis. Adjusted net earnings of $34.6 million or $0.40 per share on a basic and diluted basis. Net income includes an unrealized derivative gain of $20.0 million related to gold forward contracts entered into during Q1 2022 to reduce downside price risk during the construction of the Media Luna Project.\n-\nEBITDA1 and adjusted EBITDA1: Generated EBITDA of $127.8 million and adjusted EBITDA of $107.8 million.\n-\nCash flow from operations: Cash flow from operations totalled $102.4 million and $91.3 million prior to changes in non-cash operating working capital. Cash flow from operations includes $19.2 million of income taxes paid.\n-\nFree cash flow1: Free cash flow of $33.5 million including total capital expenditures of $68.6 million.\n-\nNet cash1 and financial liquidity: Net cash of $336.1 million, including $339.2 million in cash and $3.1 million of lease obligations, with no debt and $250.0 million of credit available on undrawn facilities, providing $589 million in available liquidity.\n-\nMedia Luna Project: Media Luna Project expenditures totalled $32.5 million during the quarter, with a remaining project spend of $812.4 million. Expenditures in the quarter were primarily focused on continued development of the Guajes Tunnel and South Portals, with development of the Guajes Tunnel reaching 2,659 metres and the South Portal Lower reaching 1,056 metres by the end of September. At the end of the quarter, physical progress on the Project was approximately 9%, with engineering, surface construction and underground development steadily progressing. Procurement activities are ramping up responsibly, with the focus being on key, long lead packages that are schedule critical. To date, lead times and costs of executed purchase orders are substantially in line with the assumptions made in the 2022 Technical Report. As a result of the lower procurement spend to date, there will be an underrun in capital expenditures on the Project for 2022, and full-year non-sustaining capital expenditure guidance for the Media Luna Project has been lowered to $120 million to $150 million.\n-\nReceipt of Key Media Luna Environmental Permit: Late in the third quarter, the Company received approval from Mexico\u2019s Secretariat of Environmental and Natural Resources (\u201cSEMARNAT\u201d) on the key, culminating environmental permit for the Project (the \u201cMIA Integral\u201d), which allows for operations to begin at Media Luna.\n-\nThese measures are Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures or Non-GAAP ratios (collectively, \u201cNon-GAAP Measures\u201d). For a detailed reconciliation of each Non-GAAP Measure to its most directly comparable IFRS financial measure see Tables 2 to 10 of this press release. For additional information on these Non-GAAP Measures, please refer to the Company\u2019s management\u2019s discussion and analysis (\u201cMD&A\u201d) for the quarter ended September 30, 2022, dated November 8, 2022.

Ganoza, President and CEO, commented, \u201cOur four mines had steady production of gold and silver in the quarter, which places us in a comfortable position at the end of the nine months of the year to meet our annual guidance estimates. Price inflation on key consumable products has driven cost at our operations to the upper range of annual cost guidance, but at this stage in the year we anticipate that the risk for significant cost deviations beyond guidance has diminished.\u201d Mr. Ganoza continued, \u201cFree cash flow for the period remained strong, underpinned by robust production performance at our operating sites.\u201d Mr. Ganoza concluded, \u201cConstruction of our flagship S\u00e9gu\u00e9la mine is 83% complete as of the end of October, remaining on-time and on-budget. We continue to successfully de-risk construction at a steady pace. All components of the SAG mill, a major equipment in the critical path of the project, have been shipped removing the last supply chain concerns on major equipment deliveries. Another milestone coming soon is the project connection to the national power grid, which is planned for December.\u201d\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| |||\n|\n|\n| Three months ended September 30, |\n| Nine months ended September 30, | |||||||||||\n|\n|\n| 2022 |\n|\n| 2021 |\n| % Change |\n| 2022 |\n| 2021 |\n| % Change | ||\n| Sales |\n| 166.6 |\n|\n| 162.6 |\n| 2 | % |\n| 516.8 |\n| 400.9 |\n| 29 | % |\n| Mine operating income |\n| 24.7 |\n|\n| 47.3 |\n| (48 | %) |\n| 120.8 |\n| 147.1 |\n| (18 | %) |\n| Operating income |\n| 5.7 |\n|\n| 21.8 |\n| (74 | %) |\n| 59.6 |\n| 98.0 |\n| (39 | %) |\n| Net (loss) income |\n| (4.1 | ) |\n| 0.2 |\n| (2,150 | %) |\n| 24.5 |\n| 42.8 |\n| (43 | %) |\n| (Loss) earnings per share - basic |\n| (0.01 | ) |\n| - |\n| 0 | % |\n| 0.08 |\n| 0.19 |\n| (58 | %) |\n| Adjusted net income1 |\n| 2.3 |\n|\n| 22.5 |\n| (90 | %) |\n| 35.4 |\n| 71.5 |\n| (50 | %) |\n| Adjusted EBITDA1 |\n| 54.4 |\n|\n| 75.3 |\n| (28 | %) |\n| 189.7 |\n| 191.1 |\n| (1 | %) |\n| Net cash provided by operating activities |\n| 64.7 |\n|\n| 39.4 |\n| 64 | % |\n| 144.6 |\n| 90.1 |\n| 60 | % |\n| Free cash flow from ongoing operations1 |\n| 34.0 |\n|\n| 29.1 |\n| 17 | % |\n| 64.8 |\n| 70.4 |\n| (8 | %) |\n| Capital expenditures2 |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| |||\n| Sustaining |\n| 23.2 |\n|\n| 16.4 |\n| 41 | % |\n| 64.3 |\n| 37.5 |\n| 71 | % |\n| Non-sustaining3 |\n| 4.0 |\n|\n| 0.7 |\n| 467 | % |\n| 10.4 |\n| 1.8 |\n| 478 | % |\n| Lindero construction |\n| - |\n|\n| 1.4 |\n| (100 | %) |\n| - |\n| 4.0 |\n| (100 | %) |\n| S\u00e9gu\u00e9la construction |\n| 23.5 |\n|\n| - |\n| 100 | % |\n| 87.6 |\n| - |\n| 100 | % |\n| Brownfields |\n| 9.6 |\n|\n| 4.3 |\n| 123 | % |\n| 17.1 |\n| 10.3 |\n| 66 | % |\n| As at |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| September 30, 2022 |\n| December 31, 2021 |\n| % Change | |||\n| Cash and cash equivalents |\n|\n|\n| 90.9 |\n| 107.1 |\n| (15 | %) | ||||||\n| Net liquidity position |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| 125.9 |\n| 187.1 |\n| (33 | %) | ||\n| 1Refer to Non-IFRS Financial Measures section of this news release and to the MD&A accompanying the Company\u2019s financial statements filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com for a description of the calculation of these measures. | |||||||||||||||\n| 2Capital expenditures are presented on a cash basis |\n| ||||||||||||||\n| 3Non-sustaining expenditures include greenfields exploration |\n| ||||||||||||||\n| Figures may not add due to rounding |\n|\nThird Quarter 2022 Results\nNet loss for the period was $4.1 million compared to net income of $0.2 million in Q3 2021. Operating income was $5.7 million compared to $21.8 million in the comparative period. Higher cash costs quarter over quarter were approximately $16.0 million due to continued inflationary pressures and higher processed tonnes at Yaramoko and San Jose. Management estimates that if realized gold and silver prices had stayed consistent with the previous year operating income would have been $13.0 million higher.\nAdditional items impacting net income in the quarter were a $3.4 million write off of the Tlamino project in Serbia, and $1.7 million of unrealized derivative losses.\nAdjusted net income for the period was $2.3 million compared to $22.5 million in Q3 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $54.4 million compared to $75.3 million in Q3 2021. The reduction in EBITDA was consistent with the drivers of lower operating income described above, namely lower silver and gold prices and inflationary cost pressures.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $64.7 million, compared to $39.4 million in Q3 2021, as the comparative quarter was impacted by $23.1 million of non-recurrent expenses ($12.6 million payment including taxes for the settlement of the disputed royalty claim with the Mexican Geological Survey and $10.5 million of transaction costs related to the Roxgold acquisition).\nFree cash flow from ongoing operations in the quarter was $34.0 million after deducting operating mine capital, corporate overhead, taxes and interest paid. Year to date free cash flow from on-going operations was $64.8 million compared to $70.4 million in 2021.\nSales for the three months ended September 30, 2022 were $166.6 million, an increase of 2% from the $162.6 million over the same period in 2021. Sales by mine in the three months ended September 30, 2022 were as follows:\n-\nLindero recognized adjusted sales of $51.9 million, a 25% increase from the $41.6 million reported in Q3 2021. Higher sales were the result of a 28% increase in volume of gold sold, partially offset by lower realized gold price of 3%.\n-\nYaramoko recognized adjusted sales of $46.4 million, a 5% decrease from the $49.0 million reported in Q3 2021. Lower sales were the result of a 2% decrease in volume of gold sold and lower realized gold price of 4%.\n-\nSan Jose recognized adjusted sales of $42.2 million, a 4% decrease from the $43.7 million reported in Q3 2021. Lower sales were driven by a 21% and 3% decrease in provisional silver and gold prices, respectively, partially offset by an increase of 7% and 2% in the volume of silver and gold ounces, respectively, sold.\n-\nCaylloma recognized adjusted sales of $26.1 million, a 7% decrease from the $28.0 million reported in Q3 2021. The decrease in sales was driven by 22% lower realized prices for silver as well as no gold sales compared to 1,466 ounces sold in the comparative period.\nOutlook on Cost and Inflation\nInflationary pressures continued in the third quarter of 2022 as a result of geopolitical events, supply chain constraints and increases in the cost of energy and commodities. These inflationary pressures were realized in the Company\u2019s cost structure as prices increased for several key commodities including diesel, reagents, explosives and steel.\nThe inflation situation remains dynamic and the Company expects higher input costs to remain for the last quarter of the year and beyond. To mitigate inflationary pressure on its cost structure the Company will continue to focus on operational efficiencies and cost optimization across all mining operations. However, even with these efforts it is expected the continued inflationary pressures will push costs towards the upper end of our cost guidance.\nLiquidity\nTotal liquidity available to the Company as at September 30, 2022 was $125.9 million, comprised of $90.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and $35.0 million undrawn on the Company\u2019s revolving $200 million credit facility.\nThe Company has secured credit approval from its banking syndicate to increase the existing senior secured revolving credit facility by $50.0 million to $250.0 million. The upsized facility will include a $50.0 million accordion feature, and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2022, subject to the completion of definitive documentation between the parties.\nS\u00e9gu\u00e9la Construction\nAs of September 30, 2022, the S\u00e9gu\u00e9la Project had approximately $54.8 million in remaining spend of the project\u2019s $173.5 million construction budget, and the project remains on time and on budget.

Gold production for Q3 2022 totaled 30,032 ounces, representing a 14% increase year-over-year. Higher gold production is mainly explained by an increase in performance of the three-stage crushing and stacking circuits, which delivered 100% of the 1.37 million tonnes of ore placed on the pad in the quarter, compared to 89% or 1.2 million tonnes of the 1.39 million tonnes placed during the comparable quarter a year ago. Mine production was 2.2 million tonnes of mineralized material with a lower strip ratio of 0.83:1 when compared to the second quarter of 2022. The reduction in the stripping ratio was a result of optimizing the mine plan sequence during the period. The operation experienced a positive reconciliation for ore sent to the leach pad during the third quarter, with grades sampled at the plant being 5.6% higher than estimated from the reserve model.\nCash cost per ounce of gold for the three months ended September 30, 2022 was $772 compared to $646 in the third quarter of 2021. Cash cost per ounce of gold was higher due to higher consumable prices, mainly related to diesel, explosives and reagents, higher service costs related to maintenance equipment rentals and higher maintenance contractor expenses, partially offset by lower labor cost.\nAll-in sustaining cash cost per gold ounce sold was $1,159 during Q3 2022 compared with $1,270 in the third quarter of 2021. All-in sustaining cash cost for the third quarter of 2022 was impacted by the issues described above, offset by higher ounces sold, lower sustaining capital and a positive by-product effect.\nSustaining capital for the quarter primarily consisted of spending on the leach pad and mine maintenance. Construction of Phase-1B of the leach pad was completed during the quarter as planned, ensuring sufficient capacity to support the production plan through the second half of 2024. Detailed engineering work for the Phase-2 leach pad expansion was initiated in the third quarter of 2022 and is expected to be completed by year end. Construction work on Phase-2 is planned to commence in 2023. Brownfields capital primarily relates to exploration at the Arizaro project.\nYaramoko Mine Complex, Burkina Faso\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| Three months ended September 30, |\n|\n| Nine months ended September 30, | ||||||\n|\n| 2022 |\n|\n| 2021 |\n|\n| 2022 |\n|\n| 2021 |\n| Mine Production |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| Tonnes milled | 137,202 |\n|\n| 126,677 |\n|\n| 403,957 |\n|\n| 126,677 |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| Gold |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| Grade (g/t) | 6.21 |\n|\n| 7.28 |\n|\n| 6.34 |\n|\n| 7.28 |\n| Recovery (%) | 97 |\n|\n| 98 |\n|\n| 97 |\n|\n| 98 |\n| Production (oz) | 27,130 |\n|\n| 28,751 |\n|\n| 79,918 |\n|\n| 28,751 |\n| Metal sold (oz) | 27,055 |\n|\n| 27,494 |\n|\n| 81,183 |\n|\n| 27,494 |\n| Realized price ($/oz) | 1,716 |\n|\n| 1,783 |\n|\n| 1,821 |\n|\n| 1,783 |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| Unit Costs |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| Cash cost ($/oz Au)1 | 934 |\n|\n| 720 |\n|\n| 847 |\n|\n| 720 |\n| All-in sustaining cash cost ($/oz Au)1 | 1,630 |\n|\n| 1,188 |\n|\n| 1,433 |\n|\n| 1,188 |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| Capital expenditures ($000's) 3 |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| Sustaining | 10,225 |\n|\n| 7,398 |\n|\n| 26,671 |\n|\n| 7,398 |\n| Brownfields | 2,530 |\n|\n| 560 |\n|\n| 3,018 |\n|\n| 560 |\n| 1 Cash cost and AISC are non-IFRS financial measures.

Comparative figures in 2021 are included from July 2, 2021 onward. | ||||||||||\n| 3 Capital expenditures are presented on a cash basis |\nThe Yaramoko Mine produced 27,130 ounces of gold in the third quarter of 2022 with an average gold head grade of 6.21g/t, which is in line with the mining sequence and Mineral Reserve estimate. The operation benefitted from higher mill throughput and operating time during the quarter offset by lower head grades when compared to the third quarter in 2021. Gold production for the first nine months of 2022 is in line with the annual guidance range.\nCash cost per gold ounce sold was $934, compared to $720 in the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to higher mining service costs related to inflation, higher processing costs due to annual mill inspection and repair moved up from November, and the processing of lower grade stockpiles during Q3 2022 as the site is currently mine constrained. This was partially offset by favorable foreign exchange rates.\nAll-in sustaining cash cost per gold ounce sold was $1,630 for Q3 2022, compared to $1,188 for the same period in 2021, as a result of decreased production, increased cash cost, and an increase in capital expenditures.\nThe operational focus remains on advancing development of the decline to maintain stope sequencing flexibility in the mine for the remainder of 2022 and into 2023. Sustaining capital for Q3 2022 was higher due to higher mine development and equipment purchases related to the QV Prime project in Bagassi South. Brownfields expenditure was higher due to greater amounts of diamond drilling as well as further development of the 109 Zone.\nSan Jose Mine, Mexico\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| Three months ended September 30, |\n|\n| Nine months ended September 30, | ||||||\n|\n| 2022 |\n|\n| 2021 |\n|\n| 2022 |\n|\n| 2021 |\n| Mine Production |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| Tonnes milled | 267,198 |\n|\n| 248,984 |\n|\n| 770,090 |\n|\n| 778,352 |\n| Average tonnes milled per day | 3,071 |\n|\n| 2,862 |\n|\n| 2,939 |\n|\n| 2,980 |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| Silver |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| Grade (g/t) | 196 |\n|\n| 195 |\n|\n| 189 |\n|\n| 206 |\n| Recovery (%) | 92 |\n|\n| 92 |\n|\n| 91 |\n|\n| 91 |\n| Production (oz) | 1,545,410 |\n|\n| 1,436,658 |\n|\n| 4,288,936 |\n|\n| 4,707,496 |\n| Metal sold (oz) | 1,539,382 |\n|\n| 1,440,946 |\n|\n| 4,272,878 |\n|\n| 4,704,656 |\n| Realized price ($/oz) | 19.14 |\n|\n| 24.16 |\n|\n| 21.86 |\n|\n| 25.80 |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| Gold |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| Grade (g/t) | 1.16 |\n|\n| 1.22 |\n|\n| 1.14 |\n|\n| 1.29 |\n| Recovery (%) | 91 |\n|\n| 91 |\n|\n| 91 |\n|\n| 91 |\n| Production (oz) | 9,091 |\n|\n| 8,910 |\n|\n| 25,625 |\n|\n| 29,477 |\n| Metal sold (oz) | 9,064 |\n|\n| 8,922 |\n|\n| 25,580 |\n|\n| 29,421 |\n| Realized price ($/oz) | 1,722 |\n|\n| 1,784 |\n|\n| 1,825 |\n|\n| 1,798 |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| Unit Costs |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| Production cash cost ($/t)2 | 79.37 |\n|\n| 77.52 |\n|\n| 79.66 |\n|\n| 74.22 |\n| Production cash cost ($/oz Ag Eq)1,2 | 9.70 |\n|\n| 9.99 |\n|\n| 10.35 |\n|\n| 9.28 |\n| All-in sustaining cash cost ($/oz Ag Eq)1,2 | 14.23 |\n|\n| 15.51 |\n|\n| 14.95 |\n|\n| 14.13 |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| Capital expenditures ($000's)3 |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| Sustaining | 4,410 |\n|\n| 3,553 |\n|\n| 12,036 |\n|\n| 9,525 |\n| Non-sustaining | \u2013 |\n|\n| 745 |\n|\n| 869 |\n|\n| 1,776 |\n| Brownfields | 1,548 |\n|\n| 2,547 |\n|\n| 4,645 |\n|\n| 6,437 |\n| 1Production cash cost silver equivalent and All-in sustaining cash cost silver equivalent are calculated using realized metal prices for each period respectively | ||||||||||\n| 2Production cash cost, Production cash cost silver equivalent, and All-in sustaining cash cost silver equivalent are Non-IFRS Financial Measures, refer to Non-IFRS Financial Measures | ||||||||||\n| 3Capital expenditures are presented on a cash basis |\nIn the third quarter of 2022, the San Jose Mine produced 1,545,410 ounces of silver and 9,091 ounces of gold, 8% and 2% higher, respectively, when compared to the equivalent period in 2021.

The operation delivered another strong quarter of operational performance and is tracking well to deliver total production in the upper range of guidance. Measured against the comparable quarter of the previous year, silver was 6% higher due to a combination of increased mill throughput, higher grades and better recoveries. Lead production was 10% higher than the comparable period as a result of higher head grades, recovery, and mill throughput. Zinc production was 4% lower than the comparable period, mainly impacted by lower head grades partially offset by higher mill throughput and recovery. Gold production totaled 91 ounces with an average head grade of 0.11 g/t.\nThe cash cost per tonne of processed ore for the three months ended September 30, 2022 increased 8% to $93.12 compared to $86.04 in the same period in 2021. The increase was mainly the result of higher mining costs driven by inflation and its direct impact on the price of materials, such as explosives, fuel, cement, reagents, mill balls and others.\nThe all-in sustaining cash cost for the three months ended September 30, 2022 decreased 11% to $15.66 per ounce compared to $17.66 per ounce for the same period in 2021 as a result of higher costs being offset by an increase in silver equivalent production.\nSustaining capital expenditures for the quarter increased primarily due to greater execution of the developments located in level 16 and level 18, offset by decreased expenditure on other levels. The decrease in brownfields capital expenditures was due to significantly lower spending on drilling and development. During the third quarter of 2022, an assessment study for a potential expansion of the mine and processing plant was commenced, with tradeoff results expected to be delivered in the first quarter of 2023.\nQualified Person\nEric Chapman, Senior Vice President of Technical Services, is a Professional Geoscientist of the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of the Province of British Columbia (Registration Number 36328), and is the Company\u2019s Qualified Person (as defined by National Instrument 43-101).

The calculation now uses taxes paid as opposed to the previous method which used current income taxes. While this may create larger quarter over quarter fluctuations due to the timing of income tax payments, management believes the revised method is a better representation of the Free Cash Flow generated by the Company\u2019s ongoing operations. Comparative values from 2021 have been restated using the change in the methodology.\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| ||||\n|\n| Three months ended September 30, |\n|\n| Nine months ended September 30, | ||||||||||\n|\n| 2022 |\n|\n| 2021 |\n|\n| 2022 |\n|\n| 2021 |\n| |||\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| (Restated) |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| (Restated) |\n| ||\n| Net cash provided by operating activities | 64.7 |\n|\n|\n| 39.4 |\n|\n|\n| 144.6 |\n|\n|\n| 90.1 |\n|\n| Adjustments |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| ||||\n| Roxgold transaction costs | - |\n|\n|\n| 3.5 |\n|\n|\n| - |\n|\n|\n| 3.5 |\n|\n| Additions to mineral properties, plant and equipment | (27.8 | ) |\n|\n| (13.8 | ) |\n|\n| (73.8 | ) |\n|\n| (23.2 | ) |\n| Progresso royalty payment | - |\n|\n|\n| - |\n|\n|\n| 3.0 |\n|\n|\n| - |\n|\n| Other adjustments | (2.9 | ) |\n|\n| - |\n|\n|\n| (9.0 | ) |\n|\n| - |\n|\n| Free cash flow from ongoing operations | 34.0 |\n|\n|\n| 29.1 |\n|\n|\n| 64.8 |\n|\n|\n| 70.4 |\n|\nFigures may not add due to rounding\nCash Cost per Ounce of Gold Sold for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022 and 2021\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| ||||\n| Lindero Mine |\n|\n| Three months ended September 30, |\n|\n| Nine months ended September 30, | ||||||||||\n| (Expressed in $'000's, except unit costs) |\n|\n| 2022 |\n|\n|\n| 2021 |\n|\n|\n| 2022 |\n|\n|\n| 2021 |\n|\n| Cost of sales |\n|\n| 43,928 |\n|\n|\n| 29,508 |\n|\n|\n| 121,122 |\n|\n|\n| 75,974 |\n|\n| Changes in dor\u00e9 inventory |\n|\n| (107 | ) |\n|\n| 1,456 |\n|\n|\n| 605 |\n|\n|\n| 2,458 |\n|\n| Inventory adjustment |\n|\n| - |\n|\n|\n| (1,743 | ) |\n|\n| - |\n|\n|\n| (1,743 | ) |\n| Export duties |\n|\n| (3,900 | ) |\n|\n| (3,137 | ) |\n|\n| (12,192 | ) |\n|\n| (8,519 | ) |\n| Depletion and depreciation |\n|\n| (14,898 | ) |\n|\n| (9,092 | ) |\n|\n| (41,203 | ) |\n|\n| (24,512 | ) |\n| By product credits |\n|\n| (232 | ) |\n|\n| (55 | ) |\n|\n| (232 | ) |\n|\n| (183 | ) |\n| Production cash cost1 |\n|\n| 24,791 |\n|\n|\n| 16,937 |\n|\n|\n| 68,100 |\n|\n|\n| 43,475 |\n|\n| Changes in dor\u00e9 inventory |\n|\n| 107 |\n|\n|\n| (1,456 | ) |\n|\n| (605 | ) |\n|\n| (2,458 | ) |\n| Realized gain in diesel hedge |\n|\n| (1,696 | ) |\n|\n| (272 | ) |\n|\n| (3,515 | ) |\n|\n| (525 | ) |\n| Cash cost applicable per gold ounce sold | A |\n| 23,202 |\n|\n|\n| 15,209 |\n|\n|\n| 63,980 |\n|\n|\n| 40,492 |\n|\n| Ounces of gold sold | B |\n| 30,052 |\n|\n|\n| 23,549 |\n|\n|\n| 89,193 |\n|\n|\n| 63,672 |\n|\n| Cash cost per ounce of gold sold1 ($/oz) | =A/B |\n| 772 |\n|\n|\n| 646 |\n|\n|\n| 717 |\n|\n|\n| 635 |\n|\n| 1 September 30, 2021 restated, Sustaining leases moved to All-In Sustaining |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| ||||\n| Yaramoko Mine |\n|\n| Three months ended September 30, |\n|\n| Nine months ended September 30, | ||||||||||\n| (Expressed in $'000's, except unit costs) |\n|\n| 2022 |\n|\n|\n| 2021 |\n|\n|\n| 2022 |\n|\n|\n| 2021 |\n|\n| Cost of sales |\n|\n| 47,481 |\n|\n|\n| 38,431 |\n|\n|\n| 129,762 |\n|\n|\n| 38,431 |\n|\n| Changes in dor\u00e9 inventory |\n|\n| - |\n|\n|\n| 823 |\n|\n|\n| (1,320 | ) |\n|\n| 823 |\n|\n| Inventory net realizable value adjustment |\n|\n| (1,050 | ) |\n|\n| - |\n|\n|\n| (5,077 | ) |\n|\n| - |\n|\n| Export duties |\n|\n| (2,817 | ) |\n|\n| (2,975 | ) |\n|\n| (8,898 | ) |\n|\n| (2,975 | ) |\n| Depletion and depreciation |\n|\n| (18,356 | ) |\n|\n| (15,739 | ) |\n|\n| (47,010 | ) |\n|\n| (15,739 | ) |\n| Refining charges |\n|\n| - |\n|\n|\n| - |\n|\n|\n| (329 | ) |\n|\n| - |\n|\n| By product credits |\n|\n| - |\n|\n|\n| (61 | ) |\n|\n| (25 | ) |\n|\n| (61 | ) |\n| Production cash cost |\n|\n| 25,258 |\n|\n|\n| 20,479 |\n|\n|\n| 67,103 |\n|\n|\n| 20,479 |\n|\n| Changes in dor\u00e9 inventory |\n|\n| - |\n|\n|\n| (823 | ) |\n|\n| 1,320 |\n|\n|\n| (823 | ) |\n| Refining charges |\n|\n| - |\n|\n|\n| 138 |\n|\n|\n| 329 |\n|\n|\n| 138 |\n|\n| Cash cost applicable per gold ounce sold | A |\n| 25,258 |\n|\n|\n| 19,794 |\n|\n|\n| 68,752 |\n|\n|\n| 19,794 |\n|\n| Ounces of gold sold | B |\n| 27,055 |\n|\n|\n| 27,475 |\n|\n|\n| 81,183 |\n|\n|\n| 27,475 |\n|\n| Cash cost per ounce of gold sold ($/oz) | =A/B |\n| 934 |\n|\n|\n| 720 |\n|\n|\n| 847 |\n|\n|\n| 720 |\n|\n| The Yaramoko Mine was acquired as part of the acquisition of Roxgold which completed on July 2, 2021.

For instructions on how to participate, please refer to the conference call and webcast section at the end of the news release.\nSebastien de Montessus, President and CEO, commented: \u201cOur strong operating performance for the first nine months of the year positions us well to deliver full year production at the top end of our guided range and costs within the guided range. This will mark our 10th consecutive year of achieving or exceeding our guidance; a record that we are extremely proud of, and a strong reflection of the resilience of our business.\nAs we enter our next growth phase, our high-margin production, sustained free cash flow generation, and strong financial position leave us well placed to continue to deliver strong shareholder returns. This year we have already increased our minimum dividend commitment by $50 million to $200 million and we have completed an additional $75 million in share buybacks. Moreover, in order to limit shareholder dilution, we have upstreamed sufficient cash in order to provide the financial flexibility to reimburse our $330 million convertible bond due Q1-2023 in cash.\nOur growth projects are progressing well with the expansion of our flagship Sabodala-Massawa mine on schedule and on budget as work starts to ramp up. Furthermore, we recently launched the construction of our next cornerstone asset, the Lafigu\u00e9 project on the Fetekro property, where early works are gathering pace. Our growth projects will increase gold production by approximately 30% from 2024 and further enhance our geographic diversification, whilst solidifying our position as a leading high-margin and low cost producer.\nOver recent years, our exploration programme has discovered the Lafigu\u00e9 project for a modest investment of $31 million at an industry leading discovery cost of $12/oz, and it continues to deliver new low-cost ounces, notably through our greenfield success at the Tanda-Iguela property in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, where we expect to publish a maiden resource in the coming weeks. In addition, we are enjoying significant near mine exploration success at several other cornerstone assets, with resource additions expected by year-end. As such, we are pleased to be on track to achieve our previously disclosed target of discovering 15-20 million ounces of Indicated resources over the 2021 to 2025 timeframe.\nIn summary, we are very pleased with the progress made so far this year and with the wet season over, we expect the final quarter to be strong as we remain focused on continuing to deliver strong operating results which underpin our ability to fund our growth and shareholder return programme.\nUPCOMING CATALYSTS\nThe key upcoming expected catalysts are summarised in the table below.\nTable 2: Key Upcoming Catalysts\n| TIMING | CATALYST |\n|\n| Q4-2022 | Mana | Wona underground first stope production |\n| Q4-2022 | Tanda-Iguela | Maiden resource |\n| Q4-2022 | Ity | Resource update |\n| Q4-2022 | Sabodala-Massawa | Expansion project progress update |\n| Q1-2023 | Shareholder Returns | Payment of H2-2022 dividend |\n| Q1-2023 | Exploration | Year-end resource update following exploration success |\nOPERATING SUMMARY\n-\nAs published in the press release dated 28 October 2022, regrettably, a fatal accident occurred at the Ity mine in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire on 27 October 2022. A contractor passed away as a result of injuries sustained in an incident that occurred during blasting activities. Endeavour is conducting a comprehensive internal investigation into the incident and is working closely with the relevant local authorities.\n-\nWhile the Group\u2019s Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (\u201cLTIFR\u201d) for continuing operations improved from 0.13 to 0.07 for the trailing twelve months ending 30 September 2022, compared to equivalent period ending 30 June 2022, Endeavour will continue to prioritise safety in accordance with its Zero-harm target.\n-\nStrong Q3-2022 performance, despite the seasonal impact of the wet season, as production and all-in sustaining cost (\u201cAISC\u201d) remained stable over Q2-2022.\n-\nQ3-2022 production from continuing operations amounted to 343koz, stable over Q2-2022 as the scheduled lower production at Hound\u00e9 and Mana was offset by higher production at Ity, Sabodala-Massawa, Wahgnion and Boungou.\n-\nQ3-2022 AISC amounted to $960 per ounce sold, stable over Q2-2022 due to a higher volume of gold produced compared to gold sold and cost increases at Boungou and Mana, which were offset by cost decreases at Hound\u00e9 and Ity.\n-\n-\nThe Group is well positioned to achieve the top-end of FY-2022 group production guidance of 1,315-1,400koz at an AISC guidance of $880-930 per ounce for continuing operations.\n-\nYTD-2022 production amounted to 1,045koz, roughly in-line with the prior year, due to stronger production from Hound\u00e9 (due to improved mining flexibility and mill throughput with the addition of the Kari mining areas), Ity (due to improved processed grades and recoveries with the addition of increased ore from Le Plaque), and Sabodala-Massawa (due to a full nine months of consolidated production following its acquisition in February 2021) while Mana remained stable (where throughput was inline with the prior year, despite the transition of the Wona deposit from an open pit to an underground operation). This offset lower production from Boungou (due to less high grade ore availability in the East pit coupled with supply chain delays) and Wahgnion (due to mining lower grade zones of the Nogbele and Fourkoura pits).\n-\nYTD-2022 AISC from continuing operations amounted to $920 per ounce, within the full year guided $880-930 per ounce range, albeit an increase of $66 per ounce over YTD-2021 with higher AISC at Boungou, Wahgnion and Sabodala-Massawa, which have been partially offset by lower AISC at Hound\u00e9 and Ity while Mana was stable.\n-\nTable 3: Group Production and FY-2022 Guidance\n|\n| THREE MONTHS ENDED | NINE MONTHS ENDED |\n|\n|\n| |||\n| All amounts in koz, on a 100% basis | 30 September | 30 June | 30 September | 30 September | 30 September | 2022 FULL-YEAR GUIDANCE | ||\n| Boungou | 29 | 27 | 41 | 90 | 139 | 130 | \u2014 | 140 |\n| Hound\u00e9 | 72 | 87 | 70 | 232 | 216 | 260 | \u2014 | 275 |\n| Ity | 81 | 77 | 61 | 230 | 212 | 255 | \u2014 | 270 |\n| Mana | 42 | 55 | 49 | 149 | 151 | 170 | \u2014 | 190 |\n| Sabodala-Massawa1 | 86 | 73 | 106 | 256 | 241 | 360 | \u2014 | 375 |\n| Wahgnion1 | 32 | 27 | 34 | 88 | 100 | 140 | \u2014 | 150 |\n| PRODUCTION FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS | 343 | 345 | 362 | 1,045 | 1,058 | 1,315 | \u2014 | 1,400 |\n| Karma2 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 21 | 10 | 67 |\n|\n|\n|\n| Agbaou3 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 13 |\n|\n|\n|\n| GROUP PRODUCTION | 343 | 345 | 382 | 1,055 | 1,138 |\n|\n|\n|\n1Included for the post acquisition period commencing 10 February 2021. 2Divested on 10 March 2022. 3Divested on 1 March 2021.\nTable 4: Group All-In Sustaining Costs and FY-2022 Guidance\n| All amounts in US$/oz | THREE MONTHS ENDED | NINE MONTHS ENDED |\n|\n|\n| |||\n| 30 September | 30 June | 30 September | 30 September | 30 September | 2022 FULL-YEAR GUIDANCE | |||\n| Boungou | 1,219 | 1,062 | 800 | 1,051 | 795 | 900 | \u2014 | 1,000 |\n| Hound\u00e9 | 716 | 807 | 921 | 767 | 833 | 875 | \u2014 | 925 |\n| Ity | 773 | 895 | 915 | 799 | 830 | 850 | \u2014 | 900 |\n| Mana | 1,098 | 905 | 1,029 | 993 | 996 | 1,000 | \u2014 | 1,100 |\n| Sabodala-Massawa1 | 779 | 779 | 655 | 703 | 667 | 675 | \u2014 | 725 |\n| Wahgnion1 | 1,647 | 1,788 | 1,097 | 1,590 | 964 | 1,050 | \u2014 | 1,150 |\n| Corporate G&A | 37 | 20 | 24 | 32 | 28 | 30 | ||\n| AISC FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS | 960 | 954 | 885 | 920 | 854 | 880 | \u2014 | 930 |\n| Karma2 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 1,256 | 1,504 | 1,162 |\n|\n|\n|\n| Agbaou3 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 1,131 |\n|\n|\n|\n| GROUP AISC | 960 | 954 | 904 | 925 | 875 |\n|\n|\n|\n1Included for the post acquisition period commencing 10 February 2021. 2Divested on 10 March 2022. 3Divested on 1 March 2021.\n-\nThe Group sustaining capital expenditure for FY-2022 is expected to be below the guidance of $169.0 million, of which $97.6 million has been incurred year to date and $28.8 million was incurred in Q3-2022. Mining activities prioritised non-sustaining pre-stripping activities to accelerate the opening of new deposits and mining areas, in order to provide more mining flexibility to sustain a better than forecasted production profile in Q4-2022 and into 2023, in addition to improvements in fleet maintenance condition monitoring which reduced mining equipment capital requirements. Further information by mine is provided in the section below.\n-\nThe Group non-sustaining capital expenditure for FY-2022 is expected to be above the guidance of $204.0 million, with $174.6 million incurred year to date and $79.5 million incurred in Q3-2022, due to higher non-sustaining capital at Boungou, Hound\u00e9, Mana, Sabodala-Massawa and Wahgnion mainly due to accelerated pre-stripping and mining infrastructure activities at certain pits this year, which will be slightly offset by lower non-sustaining capital at Ity due to less pre-stripping requirements and the timing of payments related to the Recyanidation project. Further information by mine is provided in the section below.\n-\nThe Group growth capital expenditure outlook for FY-2022 has been updated following the launch of construction at the Lafigu\u00e9 development project. The growth capital expenditure guidance for FY-2022 is $181.0 million, of which $71.9 million has been incurred year to date. During Q3-2022, $29.7 million was incurred, mainly related to the Sabodala-Massawa expansion project and the Lafigu\u00e9 project Definitive Feasibility Study (\u201cDFS\u201d) and its associated establishment works.\nSHAREHOLDER RETURNS PROGRAMME\n-\nEndeavour paid its H1-2022 dividend of $100.0 million, or $0.40 per share, on 28 September 2022, to shareholders of record on 2 September 2022. The H1-2022 dividend represents a 43% increase over the H1-2021 dividend.\n-\nIn line with its strong commitment to shareholder returns, as previously disclosed, Endeavour increased its dividend commitment for FY-2022 by $50.0 million to $200.0 million, which is to be supplemented with additional dividends and/or share buybacks provided the gold price remains above $1,500 per ounce and the Group\u2019s leverage remains below 0.5x Net Debt/adjusted EBITDA.\n-\nA total of $74.5 million or 3.4 million shares were repurchased in the first nine months of the year, of which $36.7 million or 1.7 million shares were repurchased in Q3-2022. Since the commencement of the buyback programme on 9 April 2021, a total of $212.7 million, or 9.4 million shares have been repurchased.\n-\nAs shown in the table below, Endeavour will have returned more than $613.0 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks since its shareholder returns programme began in late 2020, inclusive of the H2-2022 dividend commitment of $100.0 million, which represents approximately $278.0 million more than its minimum commitment for the period.\nTable 5: Actual Shareholder Returns vs. Minimum Commitment\n|\n| MINIMUM | ACTUAL SHAREHOLDER RETURNS | SUPPLEMENTAL | ||\n| All amounts in US$ million | DIVIDEND COMMITMENT | DIVIDENDS DECLARED | BUYBACKS COMPLETED | TOTAL RETURNS | SHAREHOLDER RETURNS |\n| FY-2020 | 60 | 60 | \u2014 | 60 | \u2014 |\n| FY-2021 | 125 | 140 | 138 | 278 | +153 |\n| FY-2022 | 150 | 200 | 75 | 275 | +125 |\n| H1-2022 | 75 | 100 | 38 | 138 | +63 |\n| H2-20221 | 75 | 100 | 37 | 137 | +62 |\n| TOTAL | 335 | 400 | 213 | 613 | +278 |\n1 $100 million dividend for H2-2022 represents the committed amount that is expected to be paid to shareholders in Q1-2023, while the $37 million of buybacks represents amount completed in Q3-2022.\nCASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY SUMMARY\nThe table below presents the cash flow and net cash position for Endeavour for the three month periods ended 30 September 2022, 30 June 2022, and 30 September 2021 and the nine month periods ending 30 September 2022 and 30 September 2021, with accompanying explanations below.\nTable 6: Cash Flow and Net Cash\n|\n|\n| THREE MONTHS ENDED | NINE MONTHS ENDED | |||\n| All amounts in US$ million unless otherwise specified |\n| 30 September 2022 | 30 June | 30 September 2021 | 30 September 2022 | 30 September 2021 |\n| Net cash from/(used in), as per cash flow statement: |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| Operating cash flows before changes in working capital from continuing operations |\n| 195 | 253 | 317 | 828 | 816 |\n| Changes in working capital |\n| (41) | 1 | (8) | (122) | (18) |\n| Cash generated from discontinued operations |\n| \u2014 | \u2014 | 3 | 5 | 13 |\n| Cash generated from operating activities | [1] | 154 | 253 | 312 | 711 | 810 |\n| Cash used in investing activities | [2] | (111) | (145) | (137) | (349) | (379) |\n| Cash used in financing activities | [3] | (256) | (26) | (233) | (332) | (360) |\n| Effect of exchange rate changes on cash |\n| (52) | (33) | (15) | (104) | (25) |\n| (DECREASE)/INCREASE IN CASH |\n| (264) | 50 | (73) | (74) | 46 |\n| Cash position at beginning of period |\n| 1,097 | 1,047 | 833 | 906 | 715 |\n| CASH POSITION AT END OF PERIOD | [4] | 833 | 1,097 | 760 | 833 | 760 |\n| Principal amount of Senior Notes |\n| (500) | (500) | (500) | (500) | (500) |\n| Principal amount of Convertible Notes |\n| (330) | (330) | (330) | (330) | (330) |\n| Drawn portion of Revolving Credit Facility |\n| \u2014 | (50) | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| Drawn portion of Corporate Loan Facility |\n| \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| NET CASH/(NET DEBT) | [5] | 3 | 217 | (70) | 3 | (70) |\n| Net cash, (Net debt) / Adjusted EBITDA (LTM) ratio1 | [5] | 0.00 x | 0.14 x | (0.05) x | 0.00 x | (0.05) x |\n1Net debt, Adjusted EBITDA, and cash flow per share are Non-GAAP measures. Refer to the non-GAAP measure section in this press release and in the Management Report.\nNOTES:\n-\nOperating cash flows decreased by $99.5 million from $253.2 million (or $1.02 per share) in Q2-2022 to $153.7 million (or $0.62 per share) in Q3-2022 largely due to a decrease in the realised gold price, an increase in the working capital outflow, a slight decrease in gold sales and higher income taxes paid.\nOperating cash flows decreased by $99.1 million from $810.3 million (or $3.42 per share) in YTD-2021 to $711.2 million (or $2.87 per share) in YTD-2022 largely due to higher working capital outflows and higher operating costs compared to the prior period.\nNotable variances are summarised below:\n-\nWorking capital was an outflow of $41.4 million in Q3-2022, an increase of $42.1 million over Q2-2022, largely due to an increase in outflows from prepayments and trade and other payables, partially offset by a decrease in outflows from inventories. Trade and other payables were an outflow of $29.8 million in Q3-2022 and primarily related to social development fund and royalty payments at Ity, Hound\u00e9 and Mana as well as the timing of supplier payments. Prepaid expenses and other were an outflow of $12.7 million in Q3-2022 and primarily related to security prepayments at Mana and Boungou. Trade and other receivables were an outflow of $8.1 million for Q3-2022, mainly driven by quarterly movements in VAT and other receivables across the portfolio. Inventories were an inflow of $9.2 million in Q3-2022 related to a decrease in stockpiles at Mana, Boungou, Wahgnion and Sabodala-Massawa used to supplement process feed.\nWorking capital was an outflow of $121.6 million in YTD-2022, an increase of $103.5 million over YTD-2021. Trade and other payables was an outflow of $43.1 million in YTD-2022 compared to an outflow of $77.2 million in YTD-2021 largely due to the prior period including payments related to the Teranga acquisition. Inventories were an outflow of $41.2 million in YTD-2022 compared to an inflow of $72.2 million in YTD-2021, mainly due to an increase in short-term stockpiles at Hound\u00e9, Ity and Wahgnion and an increase in consumables, partially offset by a decrease in gold-in circuit across the Group. Prepaid expenses and other was an outflow of $14.9 million in YTD-2022 compared to an outflow of $7.6 million in YTD-2021 mainly related to advance payments made in YTD-2022 compared to the prior period. Trade and other receivables was an outflow of $22.4 million in YTD-2022 compared to an outflow of $5.5 million in YTD-2021, mainly due to an increase in trade receivables at Sabodala-Massawa as VAT receivable increased following the expiry of the mines\u2019 VAT exemption status in May 2022, as well as increased advanced royalties at Hound\u00e9 and Boungou, which was slightly offset by a decrease in receivables at Hound\u00e9 and Boungou as a result of VAT received during YTD-2022.\n-\nGold sales from continuing operations decreased slightly from 344koz in Q2-2022 to 338koz in Q3-2022 due primarily to decreases in sales at Hound\u00e9 and Mana as a result of reduced production, and was below the quarter\u2019s production of 343koz due to gold sale timing. The realised gold price from continuing operations for Q3-2022 was $1,679 per ounce compared to $1,832 per ounce for Q2-2022. Total cash cost per ounce increased slightly from $824 per ounce in Q2-2022 to $839 per ounce in Q3-2022, primarily related to lower gold sales.\nGold sales from continuing operations decreased from 1,108koz in YTD-2021 to 1,041koz in YTD-2022 primarily due to lower sales at Boungou, Mana, Wahgnion, and Sabodala-Massawa, partially offset by higher sales at Ity and Hound\u00e9. The realised gold price from continuing operations for YTD-2022 was $1,810 per ounce compared to $1,776 per ounce for YTD-2021. Total cash cost per ounce increased from $715 per ounce in YTD-2021 to $794 per ounce in YTD-2022 largely due to the expected increases in fuel and explosive costs compared to the prior period.\n-\nIncome taxes paid increased by $17.3 million from $64.2 million in Q2-2022 to $81.5 million in Q3-2022, largely due to withholding taxes paid on cash dividends distributed from the operating entities to the corporate entity, which was partially offset by the impact of lower gold sales on taxable income.\nIncome taxes paid decreased by $9.4 million from $183.8 million in YTD-2021 to $174.4 million in YTD-2022 largely due to higher taxes paid at Boungou in YTD-2021 due to the timing of payments, which is partially offset by the higher withholding taxes paid in the YTD-2022 period.\n-\nCashflows used in investing activities decreased by $33.8 million from $144.6 million in Q2-2022 to $110.8 million in Q3-2022 largely due to lower sustaining capital, the timing of growth capital and an inflow of $10.7 million in proceeds from NSR properties sold to Auramet Trading (\u201cAuramet\u201d). The lower YTD-2022 outflow was driven primarily by the timing of growth capital payments.\n-\nSustaining capital from continuing operations decreased from $38.0 million in Q2-2022 to $28.8 million in Q3-2022 primarily due to decreased capitalised waste stripping activity at Hound\u00e9 and Wahgnion.\nSustaining capital from continuing operations decreased from $123.1 million in YTD-2021 to $97.6 million in YTD-2022, driven largely by decreased sustaining capital at Boungou, Hound\u00e9, Ity, and Sabodala-Massawa, largely related to reduced capitalised waste stripping compared to the prior period and the haul road construction to Le Plaque at Ity that was incurred in the prior period.\n-\nNon-sustaining capital from continuing operations increased from $53.2 million in Q2-2022 to $79.5 million in Q3-2022, due to increased spending on the Recyanidation project at Ity, underground development at Mana, and TSF raise activities at Mana, Ity and Wahgnion, which were partially offset by decreased spending at Hound\u00e9 and Boungou.\nNon-sustaining capital from continuing operations increased from $153.5 million in YTD-2021 to $174.6 million in YTD-2022, driven largely by increased spending at Boungou, Hound\u00e9, and Sabodala-Massawa largely related to pre-stripping activities and TSF raises.\n-\nGrowth capital decreased modestly from $34.3 million in Q2-2022 to $29.7 million in Q3-2022, largely due to the timing of payments, and primarily relates to construction activities at the Sabodala-Massawa Expansion project and early works at the Lafigu\u00e9 project.\nGrowth capital increased from $51.4 million in YTD-2021 to $71.9 million in YTD-2022 due to increased spending on the the Sabodala-Massawa Expansion project and the Lafigu\u00e9 project.\n-\nCash flows used in financing activities increased by $229.6 million from $25.9 million in Q2-2022 to $255.5 million in Q3-2022. Financing activities for Q3-2022 primarily consisted of dividends paid to shareholders of $97.3 million, dividends paid to minority shareholders of $57.2 million, repayment of the outstanding balance on the Company\u2019s revolving credit facility of $50.0 million, payments for the acquisition of the Company\u2019s own shares of $36.7 million, payments of financing and other fees of $10.9 million and repayment of finance and lease obligations of $3.4 million.\nCash flows used in financing activities decreased by $28.5 million from $360.0 million in YTD-2021 to $331.5 million in YTD-2022 largely due to slightly higher shareholder returns in YTD-2021, compared to YTD-2022. In YTD-2021, a larger proportion of shareholder returns were paid through shareholder buybacks, compared to a higher proportion of shareholder returns paid through dividends in YTD-2022. In addition higher cash flows used for financing activities in YTD-2021 were associated with the inclusion of costs associated with the refinancing of debt from the Teranga acquisition and the settlement of the off-take liability in the YTD-2021 period.\n-\nAt period-end, Endeavour\u2019s liquidity remained strong with $832.5 million of cash on hand and $500.0 million undrawn under its revolving credit facility. During Q3-2022, in order to provide flexibility to redeem its outstanding convertible notes in cash, which mature in Q1-2023, Endeavour paid dividends from its operating entities to itself and its minority shareholders (governments), to facilitate the upstreaming of its cash. This resulted in a minority interest dividend payments of $57.2 million and approximately $48.2 million in withholding tax payments, associated with dividends declared to the Company.\n-\nEndeavour\u2019s net cash position has decreased by $73.7 million YTD-2022, or $214.3 million during Q3-2022 to $2.5 million. The change in Q3-2022 is largely due to a remeasurement of the cash balance of $51.7 million due to changes in the foreign exchange rates between the Euro and Unite States dollar reporting currency, and $105.4 million related to the minority interest dividends and withholding taxes associated with cash upstreaming in order to provide flexibility to redeem outstanding convertible notes in cash, as mentioned in Note 4.\nEARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS\nThe table below presents the earnings and adjusted earnings for Endeavour for the three month periods ended 30 September 2022, 30 June 2022, and 30 September 2021 and the nine month periods ending 30 September 2022 and 30 September 2021, with accompanying explanations below.\nTable 7: Earnings from Continuing Operations\n|\n|\n| THREE MONTHS ENDED | NINE MONTHS ENDED | |||\n| All amounts in US$ million unless otherwise specified |\n| 30 September | 30 June | 30 September | 30 September | 30 September |\n| Revenue | [6] | 568 | 630 | 657 | 1,883 | 1,968 |\n| Operating expenses | [7] | (254) | (251) | (234) | (722) | (744) |\n| Depreciation and depletion | [7] | (151) | (140) | (147) | (443) | (409) |\n| Royalties | [8] | (35) | (38) | (39) | (114) | (121) |\n| Earnings from mine operations |\n| 128 | 201 | 237 | 604 | 694 |\n| Corporate costs | [9] | (12) | (7) | (12) | (33) | (42) |\n| Acquisition and restructuring costs |\n| (1) | (1) | (2) | (3) | (29) |\n| Share-based compensation |\n| (4) | (3) | (7) | (15) | (25) |\n| Other expense |\n| (7) | (11) | (2) | (20) | (13) |\n| Exploration costs |\n| (12) | (8) | (3) | (27) | (19) |\n| Earnings from operations |\n| 91 | 171 | 211 | 506 | 567 |\n| Gain/(loss) on financial instruments | [10] | 60 | 107 | (20) | (12) | 9 |\n| Finance costs |\n| (19) | (17) | (15) | (50) | (40) |\n| Earnings before taxes |\n| 132 | 261 | 177 | 444 | 536 |\n| Current income tax expense | [11] | (77) | (65) | (41) | (216) | (157) |\n| Deferred income tax recovery | [12] | 12 | 8 | 4 | 9 | 18 |\n| Net comprehensive earnings from continuing operations | [13] | 67 | 205 | 141 | 236 | 397 |\n| Add-back adjustments | [14] | (15) | (70) | 51 | 108 | 140 |\n| Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations |\n| 52 | 134 | 192 | 344 | 537 |\n| Portion attributable to non-controlling interests | [15] | 16 | 23 | 24 | 63 | 88 |\n| Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to shareholders of the Company | [16] | 36 | 111 | 168 | 281 | 449 |\n| Earnings per share from continuing operations |\n| 0.23 | 0.76 | 0.49 | 0.77 | 1.40 |\n| Adjusted net earnings per share from continuing operations |\n| 0.15 | 0.45 | 0.67 | 1.13 | 1.90 |\nNOTES:\n-\nRevenue decreased by $62.0 million from $629.6 million in Q2-2022 to $567.6 million in Q3-2022 mainly due to a lower realised gold price in Q3-2022 of $1,679 per ounce compared to $1,832 per ounce for Q2-2022 and lower production and sales from Hound\u00e9 and Mana. Gold sales from continuing operations decreased slightly from 344koz in Q2-2022 to 338koz in Q3-2022.\nRevenue decreased by $84.1 million from $1,967.5 million in YTD-2021 to $1,883.4 million in YTD-2022 due to the lower gold sales compared to the prior period, partially offset by the higher realised gold price of $1,810 per ounce in YTD-2022, compared to $1,776 per ounce in YTD-2021. Gold sales from continuing operations decreased from 1,108koz in YTD-2021 to 1,041 in YTD-2022.\n-\nOperating expenses were relatively flat at $253.6 million in Q3-2022 compared to the prior period as the expected higher fuel and consumable costs were offset by favourable exchange rate movements. Depreciation and depletion increased by $11.4 million from $139.8 million in Q2-2022 to $151.2 million in Q3-2022 mainly due to increased depletion at Hound\u00e9 and Sabodala-Massawa, partially offset by decreased depreciation at Mana.\nOperating expenses decreased by $21.7 million from $744.0 million in YTD-2021 to $722.3 million in YTD-2022 largely due to an expense incurred in YTD-2021 related to the reversal of fair value adjustments to inventory at Sabodala-Massawa in addition to the inventory charge associated with gold sold in excess of gold produced in YTD-2021 following the Teranga acquisition. These items were partially offset by increased operating costs at Sabodala-Massawa and Wahgnion mines due to the comparable cost base for YTD-2021 including costs from only the post-acquisition period in addition to slightly higher consumable and energy costs compared to the prior period. Depreciation and depletion for YTD-2022 increased by $34.4 million from $408.6 million in YTD-2021 to $443.0 million in YTD-2022 largely due to increased depreciation at the Hound\u00e9, Mana and Sabodala-Massawa mines due to an increased capital base being depreciated, partially offset by lower depreciation at Boungou due to the lower carrying value.\n-\nRoyalties slightly decreased from $38.1 million in Q2-2022 to $35.3 million in Q3-2022 due largely to the lower gold sales at a lower realised gold price in Q3-2022. Royalties decreased from $120.5 million in YTD-2021 to $114.4 million in YTD-2022 due to lower gold sales, despite the higher realised gold price.\n-\nCorporate costs increased from $6.8 million in Q2-2022 to $12.4 million in Q3-2022 due to higher corporate expenses as well as higher employee compensation due to the timing of costs being incurred and the impact of the reversal of certain bonus accruals in the prior quarter. Corporate costs decreased from $42.2 million in YTD-2021 to $33.2 million in YTD-2022 due to the cessation of costs associated with corporate integration and the LSE listing.\n-\nThe gain on financial instruments of $106.8 million in Q2-2022 decreased to a gain of $60.1 million in Q3-2022. The decrease relative to the prior quarter relates to the decrease in the realised and unrealised gains on the gold collars and forward sales of $32.2 million, and a decrease in the unrealised gain on the revaluation of the conversion option of $19.1 million. In Q3-2022, the gain on financial instruments consists of a realised gain on the gold collars and forwards of $19.7 million and an unrealised gain of $55.8 million, reflecting the lower spot gold prices in the quarter. In addition, there was an unrealised gain on the revaluation of the conversion option on the convertible senior notes (the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d) of $12.6 million due to the impact of the lower share price assumption per the bond valuation model. Q3-2022 also included a gain of $4.5 million relating to the sale of certain net smelter royalties held by the Group, and a gain of $5.5 million related to the revaluation of other financial assets in the quarter. The gain was partly offset by foreign exchange losses of $31.6 million, primarily on outstanding cash balances, driven by the weakening of the Euro against the Dollar and the realised and unrealised loss on foreign currency contracts of $0.4 million and $6.0 million, respectively.\nThe gain on financial instruments of $9.4 million million in YTD-2021 decreased to a loss of $11.9 million in YTD-2022. The loss in YTD-2022 is primarily due to the net impact of foreign exchange losses of $89.6 million due to the impact of the Euro weakening against the USD and the realised and unrealised loss on foreign currency contracts of $0.4 million and $6.0 million, respectively. This was in part offset by the gold collars and forward contracts which amounted to realised and unrealised gains of $14.1 million and $39.1 million, respectively, driven by the lower gold prices. Also included is an unrealised gain on the conversion option on the Convertible Notes of $26.3 million driven by assumption changes per the bond valuation model since the start of the year, and a gain on the disposal of certain net smelter royalties of $4.5 million.\nAs previously disclosed, Endeavour entered into a revenue protection programme for a portion of its production across FY-2022 and FY-2023, to provide greater cash flow visibility during its investment phase. This was structured as an upfront low premium collar with a put price of $1,750 per ounce and a call price of $2,100 per ounce for 75koz of production per quarter, from Q1-2022 until Q4-2023. In addition, the Company entered into forward sales contracts for FY-2022 and FY-2023, for which 95koz at an average gold price of $1,834 per ounce were financially delivered in Q3-2022. Forward contracts scheduled to be settled in Q4-2022 amount to 90koz at an average gold price of $1,842. For FY-2023, forward sales contracts amount to 120koz, or 30koz ounces per quarter at an average gold price of $1,828 per ounce.\nEndeavour has entered into a growth capital protection programme designed to enhance cost certainty for a portion of its upcoming growth capital expenditure at its Sabodala-Massawa Expansion and Lafigu\u00e9 growth projects. The Group has entered into various foreign exchange forward contracts across both the Euro and the Australian Dollar over the next two years. The total notional forward contracted quantum is approximately \u20ac148.4 million at a blended rate of 0.98 EUR:USD split over 2022, 2023 and 2024 at approximately 39%, 53% and 9% respectively and approximately AU$58.9 million at a blended rate of 0.69 AUD:USD split approximately 28%, 62% and 10% respectively over the same period. During Q3-2022, the Group incurred a realised loss on foreign exchange contracts of $0.4 million and an unrealised loss on foreign exchange contracts of $6.0 million.\n-\nCurrent income tax expense increased by $12.3 million from $64.7 million in Q2-2022 to $77.0 million in Q3-2022 largely due to a higher weighted average domestic tax rate as a result of lower proportional production from assets with lower tax rates including Hound\u00e9 and Mana, in addition to the withholding tax expense recognised on the dividend declared by Sabodala-Massawa during the quarter.\nCurrent income taxes increased by $59.4 million from $157.0 million in YTD-2021 to $216.4 million in YTD-2022 due to an increase in tax expense at Sabodala-Massawa as a result of the start-up of mining at the Massawa pits as well as an increase in taxable profit at Ity due to earnings generated at Floleu, which includes the Le Plaque pit, which was partially offset by a decrease in tax expense at Boungou associated with lower levels of production.\n-\nDeferred income tax recovery increased by $3.7 million from $8.2 million in Q2-2022 to $11.9 million in Q3-2022, mainly due to the reversal of deferred tax liabilities previously recognised on estimated distribution of earnings, partially offset by the impact of changes in the foreign exchange rates on the deferred tax calculations. In YTD-2022, a deferred income tax recovery of $8.9 million compared to a deferred tax recovery of $17.7 million in YTD-2021, mainly due to the higher impact of changes in the foreign exchange rates on the deferred tax calculations and the deferred tax impact of the unwinding of the fair value adjustment to inventory at Sabodala-Massawa recognised in YTD-2021. The absence of these recoveries in YTD-2022 contributed to the lowered deferred tax recovery for YTD-2022.\n-\nNet comprehensive earnings from continuing operations decreased by $137.4 million from $204.5 million in Q2-2022 to $67.1 million in Q3-2022. The decreased earnings are attributed to lower gold sales, higher depreciation, higher taxes, and a lower gain on financial instruments compared to the prior period. For YTD-2022, net comprehensive earnings of $236.4 million was recognised, a decrease on the earnings of $397.0 million recognised in YTD-2021 due largely to lower gold sales, higher depreciation, and higher taxes.\n-\nFor Q3-2022, adjustments included a gain on financial instruments of $60.1 million largely related to the unrealised gain on forward sales and collars, non-cash, tax and other adjustments of $36.9 million that mainly relate to the impact of the foreign exchange remeasurement of deferred tax balances and a write-down of inventory at Wahgnion to net realisable value, other expenses of $7.4 million, and acquisition and restructuring costs of $1.0 million. For YTD-2022, adjustments mainly included non-cash, tax and other adjustments of $73.2 million that mainly relate to the impact of the foreign exchange remeasurement of deferred tax balances and non-cash fair value adjustments to inventory associated with the acquisition of Teranga, other expenses of $20.0 million, a loss on financial instruments of $11.9 million largely related to the unrealised loss on forward sales and acquisition and restructuring costs of $2.5 million.\n-\nAdjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to non-controlling interests decreased to $15.8 million in Q3-2022 from $23.1 million in Q2-2022 due to lower earnings from mine operations during Q3-2022.\n-\nAdjusted net earnings attributable to shareholders for continuing operations decreased by $74.8 million to $36.5 million (or $0.15 per share) in Q3-2022 compared to $111.3 million (or $0.45 per share) in Q2-2022 due largely to lower earnings from mining operations as a result of lower group production at a lower realised gold price, higher depreciation and higher taxes. In YTD-2022 adjusted net earnings attributable to shareholders for continuing operations decreased to $281.2 million (or $1.13 per share) from $449.3 million (or $1.90 per share) in YTD-2021 due to higher income tax expense due largely to lower gold sales, higher depreciation, and higher taxes.\nOPERATING ACTIVITIES BY MINE\nBoungou Gold Mine, Burkina Faso\nTable 8: Boungou Performance Indicators\n| For The Period Ended | Q3-2022 | Q2-2022 | Q3-2021 |\n| YTD-2022 | YTD-2021 |\n| Tonnes ore mined, kt | 210 | 272 | 539 |\n| 734 | 1,136 |\n| Total tonnes mined, kt | 3,559 | 5,115 | 7,126 |\n| 15,008 | 22,145 |\n| Strip ratio (incl. waste cap) | 15.95 | 17.81 | 12.22 |\n| 19.45 | 18.50 |\n| Tonnes milled, kt | 338 | 366 | 349 |\n| 1,053 | 1,000 |\n| Grade, g/t | 2.84 | 2.47 | 3.76 |\n| 2.78 | 4.34 |\n| Recovery rate, % | 94 | 93 | 95 |\n| 94 | 95 |\n| PRODUCTION, KOZ | 29 | 27 | 41 |\n| 90 | 139 |\n| Total cash cost/oz | 1,172 | 996 | 717 |\n| 996 | 675 |\n| AISC/OZ | 1,219 | 1,062 | 800 |\n| 1,051 | 795 |\nQ3-2022 vs Q2-2022 Insights\n-\nProduction increased from 27koz in Q2-2022 to 29koz in Q3-2022, due to higher processed grade, which was partially offset by lower mill throughput.\n-\nTotal tonnes mined and tonnes of ore mined decreased as mining activities were reduced in order to manage production through supply chain delays. Ore mining was focussed on the higher grade areas of the West pit while waste development was focussed on the West pit flank.\n-\nTonnes milled decreased due to slightly lower mill availability and utilisation, which was partially offset by improved milling rates benefiting from improvements in blasting fragmentation.\n-\nProcessed grade increased as ore was sourced from higher grade areas of the West pit, in line with the mine sequence.\n-\nRecovery rates increased slightly due to an increased proportion of ore from the West pit being processed, which has higher associated recovery rates.\n-\n-\nAISC increased from $1,062 per ounce in Q2-2022 to $1,219 per ounce in Q3-2022 due to the increase in unit costs resulting from supply chain delays, which were slightly offset by lower sustaining capital.\n-\nSustaining capital expenditure decreased from $1.8 million in Q2-2022 to $1.4 million in Q3-2022 and primarily related to mining infrastructure and capital spares.\n-\nNon-sustaining capital expenditure decreased from $8.3 million in Q2-2022 to $4.0 million in Q3-2022 and primarily related to pre-stripping activity at the West pit flank.\nYTD-2022 vs YTD-2021 Insights\n-\nProduction decreased from 139koz YTD-2021 to 90koz YTD-2022 primarily due to lower processed grades and supply chain delays in YTD-2022, while higher grade stockpiles were used to supplement the higher grade ore sourced from the West pit in 2021.\n-\nAISC increased from $795 per ounce YTD-2021 to $1,051 per ounce YTD-2022 as a result of the decrease in gold volumes sold, higher unit mining costs and use of lower grade stockpiles, which were partially offset by lower sustaining capital spend.\n2022 Outlook\n-\nBoungou\u2019s FY-2022 production is expected to be below the guided 130\u2014140koz range and its FY-2022 AISC is expected to be above its $900 - $1,000 per ounce range, given supply chain delays which are limiting mining activities and causing production interruptions.\n-\nIn Q4-2022, waste extraction is expected to continue in the West pit and West pit flank, while ore is expected to continue to be sourced mainly from the West pit. Mill throughput is expected to be significantly lower during the quarter as a result of supply chain delays which has resulted in several plant downtimes during the quarter to date, while grades are expected to remain flat as the higher grade ore from the West pit is expected to be blended with lower grade stockpiles.\n-\nThe sustaining capital expenditure for FY-2022 is expected to be below the guidance of $15.0 million, of which $5.1 million has been incurred YTD-2022 as a result of lower than planned waste tonnes mined from the East pit in H1-2022 resulting in lower capitalised waste. In Q4-2022, sustaining capital expenditure is expected to mainly relate to borehole installations and processing infrastructure.\n-\nThe non-sustaining capital expenditure for FY-2022 will amount to more than the guidance of $19.0 million, with $21.5 million already incurred YTD-2022, as more capital was dedicated to the West pit stage 3 push back in H1-2022 and West pit flank pre-strip in H2-2022. In Q4-2022, non-sustaining capital expenditure is expected to mainly relate to the West pit flank pre-stripping activity.\nHound\u00e9 Gold Mine, Burkina Faso\nTable 9: Hound\u00e9 Performance Indicators\n| For The Period Ended | Q3-2022 | Q2-2022 | Q3-2021 |\n| YTD-2022 | YTD-2021 |\n| Tonnes ore mined, kt | 1,174 | 1,330 | 596 |\n| 3,842 | 3,620 |\n| Total tonnes mined, kt | 9,178 | 10,725 | 11,966 |\n| 32,589 | 37,620 |\n| Strip ratio (incl. waste cap) | 6.82 | 7.06 | 19.07 |\n| 7.48 | 9.39 |\n| Tonnes milled, kt | 1,234 | 1,217 | 1,142 |\n| 3,684 | 3,396 |\n| Grade, g/t | 1.83 | 2.42 | 2.11 |\n| 2.06 | 2.15 |\n| Recovery rate, % | 92 | 94 | 92 |\n| 93 | 92 |\n| PRODUCTION, KOZ | 72 | 87 | 70 |\n| 232 | 216 |\n| Total cash cost/oz | 631 | 699 | 631 |\n| 676 | 672 |\n| AISC/OZ | 716 | 807 | 921 |\n| 767 | 833 |\nQ3-2022 vs Q2-2022 Insights\n-\nProduction decreased from 87koz in Q2-2022 to 72koz in Q3-2022 due to lower grade ore processed and lower gold recoveries.\n-\nTotal tonnes mined and tonnes of ore mined decreased slightly compared to the prior quarter due to increased rainfall impacting mining at the Vindaloo Main and Kari West pits. Ore mining was focussed on the Kari Pump pit with supplemental ore from the Vindaloo Main and Kari West pits.\n-\nTonnes milled increased slightly due to higher mill availability, despite a slightly higher proportion of transitional and fresh ore being introduced into the ore blend.\n-\nAverage processed grades decreased due to mining in lower grade areas of the Kari Pump pit as well as lower grades from the Vindaloo Main and Kari West pits.\n-\nRecovery rates decreased slightly due to the slightly higher proportion of transitional and fresh ore in the ore blend.\n-\n-\nAISC decreased from $807 per ounce in Q2-2022 to $716 per ounce in Q3-2022 due to lower processing unit cost, lower sustaining capital and the lower strip ratio during the quarter, which was partially offset by lower gold sales in the period.\n-\nSustaining capital expenditure decreased from $9.3 million in Q2-2022 to $6.4 million in Q3-2022 due to lower waste capitalisation at the Vindaloo Main pit as well as mining fleet re-builds.\n-\nNon-sustaining capital expenditure increased from $3.4 million in Q2-2022 to $18.4 million in Q3-2022, mainly related to the acceleration of pre-stripping at the next stage of the Kari Pump pit, as well as the ongoing TSF raise and infrastructure in the Kari area.\nYTD-2022 vs YTD-2021 Insights\n-\nProduction increased from 216koz YTD-2021 to 232koz YTD-2022 as a result of increased mill throughput and recoveries due to increased mining flexibility and availability of a higher proportion of soft oxide ore from the Kari West pit. The average grade in the mill feed decreased slightly, due to lower grade areas mined at the Kari Pump pit and the use of lower grade stockpiles.\n-\nAISC decreased from $833 per ounce YTD-2021 to $767 per ounce YTD-2022 due to the greater volume of ounces sold and lower sustaining capital, which was partially offset by higher operating costs.\n2022 Outlook\n-\nHound\u00e9 is expected to beat its FY-2022 production guidance of 260\u2014275koz and also beat its AISC guidance of $875\u2014925 per ounce as YTD-2022 performance was stronger than forecast due to the benefit of high-grade oxide ore from the Kari Pump pit.\n-\nIn Q4-2022, ore is expected to be mainly sourced from the Vindaloo Main and Kari West pits, while stripping activities continue at the Kari Pump pit stage 3. Slightly lower ore tonnes mined, ore tonnes processed, processed grades and recovery rates are expected in Q4-2022 due to the increased focus on stripping activity and lower quantities of high grade oxide ore available from the Kari Pump pit.\n-\nThe sustaining capital expenditure for FY-2022 is expected to be below the guidance of $44.0 million, of which $21.1 million has been incurred YTD-2022, primarily due to timing of Vindaloo waste development. In Q4-2022, sustaining capital is expected to relate to spare parts and fleet re-builds as well as waste capitalisation at the Vindaloo Main pit.\n-\nThe non-sustaining capital expenditure for FY-2022 will amount to more than the guidance of $18.0 million, with $25.6 million already incurred YTD-2022, primarily due to the acceleration of pre-stripping activity at the Kari Pump stage 3 pit, in support of the strong YTD-2022 production outperformance. In Q4-2022, non-sustaining capital expenditure is expected to relate to pre-stripping activities at the Kari Pump stage 3 pit, resettlement, mine infrastructure in the Kari West area and completion of a TSF wall raise.\nIty Gold Mine, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\nTable 10: Ity Performance Indicators\n| For The Period Ended | Q3-2022 | Q2-2022 | Q3-2021 |\n| YTD-2022 | YTD-2021 |\n| Tonnes ore mined, kt | 1,180 | 1,668 | 1,690 |\n| 5,382 | 5,672 |\n| Total tonnes mined, kt | 4,925 | 6,027 | 5,576 |\n| 17,902 | 18,326 |\n| Strip ratio (incl. waste cap) | 3.17 | 2.61 | 2.30 |\n| 2.33 | 2.23 |\n| Tonnes milled, kt | 1,375 | 1,597 | 1,530 |\n| 4,641 | 4,624 |\n| Grade, g/t | 2.04 | 1.77 | 1.50 |\n| 1.82 | 1.74 |\n| Recovery rate, % | 87 | 86 | 83 |\n| 84 | 81 |\n| PRODUCTION, KOZ | 81 | 77 | 61 |\n| 230 | 212 |\n| Total cash cost/oz | 741 | 804 | 828 |\n| 751 | 749 |\n| AISC/OZ | 773 | 895 | 915 |\n| 799 | 830 |\nQ3-2022 vs Q2-2022 Insights\n-\nProduction increased from 77koz in Q2-2022 to 81koz in Q3-2022 due to a higher average grade processed and improved recoveries, which was slightly offset by lower plant throughput.\n-\nTotal tonnes mined and tonnes of ore mined decreased due to the impact of the wet season and to a greater focus on waste stripping activity at the Bakatouo and Le Plaque pits, which resulted in an increased strip ratio during the quarter.\n-\nTonnes milled decreased due to the higher proportion of fresh and transitional ore processed which resulted in lower throughput rates.\n-\nAverage grade milled increased slightly as an increased proportion of high grade ore from Le Plaque was processed.\n-\nRecovery rates increased slightly due to the higher proportion of fresh ore blended into the feed during the wet season to reduce plant blockages, which has higher associated recoveries in the mill feed.\n-\n-\nAISC decreased from $895 per ounce in Q2-2022 to $773 per ounce in Q3-2022 primarily due to lower sustaining capital as a result of less waste stripping during the quarter, which was partially offset by higher unit mining costs due to the higher haulage costs associated with the increased proportion of ore feed from the Le Plaque pit.\n-\nSustaining capital expenditure decreased from $6.9 million in Q2-2022 to $2.5 million in Q3-2022 and related primarily to spare parts, mine infrastructure and mining fleet upgrades.\n-\nNon-sustaining capital expenditure increased from $5.6 million in Q2-2022 to $15.4 million in Q3-2022 and related primarily to the ongoing Recyanidation project, the TSF stage 4 compensation and waste capitalisation associated with the Ity pit cut back.\n-\nThe Recyanidation project remains on track to be commissioned in mid-2023, with approximately 30% of the project completed to date. Detailed design and engineering has been completed and procurement is now 50% complete. Early works, including bulk earthworks and civil works are underway and 52% of the capital has now been committed. The circuit aims to optimise costs by reducing leaching and detox reagent consumption, improving the quality of the discharge water, and increasing production through higher recovery rates.

Additional ore tonnes are expected to be sourced from Wona underground, as development continues to ramp up with the first stope production expected during the quarter, and from the Maoula satellite pit where mining activities are expected to commence during the quarter. Mill throughput is expected to decrease slightly due to planned maintenance. Processed grades are expected to increase due to higher grades from Siou underground and supplementary ore from Wona underground and the Maoula pit, which are expected to reduce the need to blend with lower grade stockpiles. Recovery rates are expected to remain stable.\n-\nThe sustaining capital expenditure for FY-2022 is expected to be above the guidance of $7.0 million, with $7.3 million already incurred YTD-2022, due to additional infrastructure and mining equipment costs in the year.

Ore mining continued at the Sabodala, Sofia North and Massawa Central Zone pits, while waste extraction activities continued in the Sabodala pit. Pre-stripping activities commenced at the Bambaraya deposit during the quarter.\n-\nTonnes milled decreased slightly compared to the prior quarter as higher than average rainfall during the quarter contributed to slightly lower throughput volumes due to the wet oxide ore reducing the crushing circuit availability.\n-\nAverage processed grades increased due to the introduction of a higher proportion of high grade oxide ore from the Massawa North pit.\n-\n-\nAISC remained flat at $779 per ounce in Q3-2022, as higher mining unit costs associated with more material being transported from the Massawa pits and higher sustaining capital due to increased capitalised stripping were offset by the higher volumes of gold sold.\n-\nSustaining capital expenditure increased from $8.1 million in Q2-2022 to $9.4 million in Q3-2022 and was was mainly related to waste capitalisation at the Sabodala pit, in addition to mining equipment upgrades, dewatering projects and some plant and infrastructure upgrades.\n-\nNon-sustaining capital expenditure increased from $11.8 million in Q2-2022 to $12.1 million in Q3-2022 and was mainly related to the acceleration and establishment works at the Bambaraya satellite deposit, the new Sabodala village construction and infrastructure development around the Massawa mining area.\n-\nProduction increased from 241koz in YTD-2021 to 256koz in YTD-2022 as a result of the full period of consolidation following the acquisition of Sabodala in Q1-2021, partially offset by a decrease in the average grade processed as less high grade Sofia Main ore was available in YTD-2022.\n-\nAISC increased from $667 per ounce YTD-2021 to $703 per ounce YTD-2022 as a result of the increased use of lower grade stockpiles and increased unit operating costs.\nYTD-2022 vs YTD-2021 Insights\n-\nProduction increased from 241koz in YTD-2021 to 256koz in YTD-2022 as a result of the full period of consolidation following the acquisition of Sabodala in Q1-2021, partially offset by a decrease in the average grade processed as less high grade Sofia Main ore was available in YTD-2022.\n-\nAISC increased from $667 per ounce YTD-2021 to $703 per ounce YTD-2022 as a result of the increased use of lower grade stockpiles and increased unit operating costs.\n2022 Outlook\n-\nSabodala-Massawa is on track to achieve its FY-2022 production guidance of 360\u2014375koz and its AISC guidance of $675\u2014725 per ounce.\n-\nDuring Q4-2022, ore extraction at both the Massawa Central Zone and Massawa North Zone pits is expected to continue, with supplemental ore expected to be sourced from the Sofia North, Sabodala and Bambaraya pits. A continued focus on waste extraction is expected at the Massawa Central and North Zones pits. Mined and processed grades are expected to increase due to increased contributions from the high grade Massawa North Zone pit, while mill throughput rates are also expected to increase following the end of the rainy season.\n-\nThe sustaining capital expenditure for FY-2022 is expected to be below the guidance of $63.0 million, of which $29.7 million has been incurred YTD-2022, due to improvements in fleet maintenance condition monitoring effectively reducing mining equipment capital and the deferral of waste stripping. In Q4-2022, sustaining capital is expected to mainly relate to waste stripping activities at Sabodala, Massawa Central Zone and Massawa North Zone and continued mining equipment upgrades.\n-\nThe non-sustaining capital expenditure for FY-2022 will be above the guidance of $34.0 million, with $33.2 million already incurred for YTD-2021, due to the acceleration of mining at the Bambaraya open pit and associated infrastructure.

Mill throughput is expected to increase in Q4-2022 following the end of the rainy season with grades improving due to the inclusion of greater volumes of ore from Samavogo in the mill feed.\n-\nThe sustaining capital expenditure for FY-2022 will be above the guidance of $20.0 million, with $22.0 million already incurred during YTD-2022 due to increased mining volumes at higher than anticipated strip ratios resulting in increased capitalised waste. In Q4-2022, sustaining capital is expected to mainly relate to increased volumes of capitalised waste mining and heavy mining equipment maintenance.\n-\nThe non-sustaining capital expenditure for FY-2022 is expected to be slightly above the guidance of $23.0 million, with $21.3 million already incurred during YTD-2022 due to the capitalised drilling programme that commenced in H2-2022 and acceleration of Samavogo mining activities. In Q4-2022, non-sustaining capital is expected to mainly relate to ongoing infrastructure at the Samavogo satellite pit, capitalised drilling and the TSF cell 2 wall raise.\nLAFIGU\u00c9 DEVELOPMENT PROJECT\n-\nConstruction of the Lafigu\u00e9 project on the Fetekro property in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire was launched in early Q4-2022, following the completion of a DFS which confirmed Lafigu\u00e9\u2019s potential to be a cornerstone asset for Endeavour. The project will have a 4Mtpa capacity CIL plant, with an annual production of 203koz at a low AISC of $871 per ounce over its initial 12.8 year mine life, with significant exploration potential on the Fetekro property. First gold production is scheduled for Q3-2024.\n-\nGrowth capital expenditure for the project is approximately $448 million, of which $60 million is expected to be incurred in FY-2022 and 12% of the total capital spend has already been committed. Initial works are mainly related to site roads, which are over 50% complete, process plant earthworks, which are 15% complete, and the detailed engineering which is 18% complete. The completed airstrip has been certified for use by the national aviation authority and the construction camp is being erected.\nEXPLORATION ACTIVITIES\n\u2022 Endeavour continued to advance its extensive FY-2022 exploration programme of $80.0 million, with over 340,000 meters of drilling completed year to date, amounting to a total spend of $68.1 million, of which $23.2 million was spent in Q3-2022.\n\u2022 During the year to date, exploration activities were mainly focussed on expanding resources at existing operations and delineating new greenfield opportunities, with significant success achieved at the Tanda-Iguela property in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, where a maiden resource is expected to be defined in Q4-2022. Furthermore, following exploration successes across the group, Endeavour expects to publish a resource update for its Ity mine later in Q4-2022, and its other mines within its year-end resource update in Q1-2023.\n\u2022 Endeavour remains on track to achieve its 5 year exploration target of discovering 15 to 20Moz of Indicated resources over the 2021 to 2025 period, at the low discovery cost of less than $25 per ounce.\nTable 14: Consolidated Q3-2022 exploration expenditures and 2022 guidance1\n| All amounts in US$ million | Q3-2022 | YTD-2022 | FY-2022 GUIDANCE |\n| Boungou mine | 0.3 | 1.9 | 4.0 |\n| Hound\u00e9 mine | 5.3 | 10.9 | 14.0 |\n| Ity mine | 3.5 | 8.0 | 10.0 |\n| Mana mine | 0.3 | 5.6 | 6.0 |\n| Sabodala-Massawa mine | 3.4 | 12.5 | 15.0 |\n| Wahgnion mine | 2.2 | 7.0 | 9.0 |\n| Lafigu\u00e9 project | 1.4 | 6.2 | 7.0 |\n| Greenfield and development projects | 6.8 | 16.0 | 15.0 |\n| TOTAL | 23.2 | 68.1 | 80.0 |\nNote: Amounts may differ from Management Report due to rounding\n1Consolidated exploration expenditures include expensed, sustaining, and non-sustaining exploration expenditures.\nBoungou mine\n-\nAn exploration programme of $4.0 million is planned for FY-2022, of which $1.9 million has been spent YTD-2022 with $0.3 million spent in Q3-2022.

The exploration programme has been focussed on extending the resources at Vindaloo South, and testing new targets including Sianikui and Koho.\n-\nDuring Q3-2022, resource definition drilling was completed at the Koho deposit, which is located less than 1 kilometre east of the Vindaloo Main pit, within the mine permit, where drilling focussed on identifying and characterising mineralised extensions to the Vindaloo Main ore body towards the east. Reconnaissance drilling was also completed at several geochemical targets within 15 kilometres of the Vindaloo Main pit, with encouraging results from Sianikui.\n-\nDuring the remainder of the year, exploration will focus on geological modelling of new drill results from Vindaloo South and Koho with the aim of upgrading mineral resources ahead of the year end. At Vindaloo Main, deep, high-grade mineralisation has been identified with up to three kilometers of cumulative strike across several ore bodies, further work will focus on identifying the potential for a deeper mineral resource. In addition, exploration drilling is expected to continue at the Koho and Sianikui targets to delineate these prospects and define new resources.\nIty mine\n-\nAn exploration programme of $10.0 million is planned for FY-2022, of which $8.0 million has been spent in YTD-2022 with $3.5 million spent in Q3-2022 consisting of 13,500 meters of drilling across 72 drill holes. The exploration programme has been focused on extending resources at several near mine deposits including Walter-Bakatouo, West Flotouo, Le Plaque and Yopleu-Legaleu, Delta Extension, delineating resources at Colline Sud and assessing the potential of new greenfield targets including Gbampleu, Bakatouo-Zia Northeast and Delta South East.\n-\nDuring Q3-2022, drilling at West Flotouo extended the northeast-southwest mineralised trend down dip, confirming its continuity at depth and bringing the overall mineralised footprint to over 1,000 x 300 meters, and it remain open along strike and at depth. At Yopleu-Legaleu drilling during the quarter extended the mineralised trend along strike in both directions. At Daapleu, some new mineralised lenses were discovered during a sterilisation program in the quarter, highlighting the continuity of mineralisation around the Ity mine. At Colline Sud mineralisation was extended a further 300 meters to the northeast. At Walter-Bakatouo and Delta Southeast, new mineralised zones have been identified that will be investigated further in Q4-2022 and through 2023.\n-\nDuring the remainder of the year, the exploration programme will focus on drilling at near mine deposits as well as follow up works at the four greenfield targets highlighted above, including follow up work on the mineralisation discovered at Gbampleau, located 22 kilometers south of the Ity mine, where reconnaissance drilling conducted during the quarter identified significant mineralisation intercepts. Following exploration success during the year at the near mine deposits, a resource update for the Ity mine is expected in Q4-2022.\nMana mine\n-\nAn exploration programme of $6.0 million is planned for FY-2022, of which $5.6 million has been spent year to date with $0.3 million spent in Q3-2022 consisting of 21,100 meters of drilling across 204 drill holes focused on increasing the size of the resources at Maoula Est, Fofina and Nyafe, delineating near mine exploration targets and testing new greenfield targets.\n-\nDuring Q3-2022, limited drilling was completed as the exploration programme was focussed on reviewing drilling results from Nyafe and Fofina, where deep refractory ore mineralisation was being targeted, and from Kokoi and Doumakele Est, where reconnaissance drilling was focussed on identifying mineralisation. In addition exploration work continued to focus on upgrading inferred resources at the Maoula Est deposit.\n-\nDuring the remainder of the year, the exploration programme will focus on relogging and geological modelling of historical drilling results from the Yaho, Yama, Fobiri and Fofina Sud targets. In addition several new targets have been generated through the use of the innovative predictive targeting analysis, which employs machine learning to analyse 48 layers of geological, geochemical, and geophysical data to identify and rank exploration targets. Field reconnaissance of 78 high priority targets identified, will continue for the reminder of the year.\nSabodala-Massawa mine\n-\nAn exploration programme of $15.0 million is planned for FY-2022, of which $12.5 million has been spent year to date with $3.4 million spent in Q3-2022 consisting of 25,000 meters of drilling across 295 drill holes. The exploration programme is focussed on identifying and defining non-refractory resources at targets within the Massawa area including Bambaraya, Makana, Tiwana, Delya South, and Kaviar, delineating a new discovery called Kiesta, in addition to developing new targets along the Main Transcurrent Shearzone and Sabodala-Sofia Zone first order structures.\n-\nThe Bambaraya deposit is located in the northwest corner of the Massawa mining license, approximately 13 kilometers south of the Sabodala-Massawa processing plant. Following successful exploration work during H1-2022, an updated mineral resource was defined for the Bambaraya deposit with Indicated mineral resources of 2.2Mt at 1.77g/t for 126koz of gold and Inferred mineral resources of 0.16Mt at 1.56g/t for 8koz of gold, with an effective date 10 March 2022, based on a 0.5g/t gold cut off grade and a $1,500 per ounce pit shell. The updated resource is an increase of 126koz of Indicated resources compared to the previous mineral resource, with an effective date of 31 December 2021, which contained Inferred resources of 0.57Mt at 2.09g/t for 39koz. As a result of the positive updated mineral resource, mining activities at Bambaraya began during the quarter. Mineralisation has been recognised within a northeast trending splay of the first order Sabodala Shear Zone over a 2,000 meter strike length with an average width of 250 meters, hosted by a brecciated contact zone between pillowed basalts and andesite units.\n-\nDuring Q3-2022, follow up drilling at the Kiesta prospect discovered in Q2-2022, extended mineralisation over 1,000 meters along strike with three zones of mineralisation identified and open along strike and at depth, for which a maiden resource is expected to be estimated by year-end. At Delya South, drilling continued to extend the high grade mineralization to over 1,200 meters along strike connecting to Delya Main to the northeast and towards Samina to the southwest. Drilling at Kaviar focussed on delineating the envelop of the identified mineralisation along strike and further testing similar mineralized structures to the south-west\n-\nDuring the remainder of the year, the exploration programme will be focussed on defining maiden resources at Makana, Delya South, Kaviar and Tiwana, as well as follow up drilling on other Massawa area targets, including Kiesta.\nWahgnion mine\n-\nAn exploration programme of $9.0 million is planned for FY-2022, of which $7.0 million has been spent YTD-2022 with $2.2 million spent in Q3-2022 consisting of 9,800 meters of drilling across 90 drill holes. The programme was focussed on advancing the Ouahiri South, Bozogo, Nongbele and Nangolo targets within close proximity to the Wahgnion mill, as well as evaluating the Kassera and Samavogo Nord satellite targets.\n-\nDuring Q3-2022, drilling at Ouahiri South continued to test the large soil geochemical anomaly with a systematic drill programme identifying high grade quartz-vein hosted mineralisation. At the Nongbele and Nangolo targets, located immediately adjacent to the Nogbele pits, mineralisation has been identified and drilling will continue to test the mineralised potential along strike and at depth. Infill drilling at the Kassera satellite deposit has identified mineralisation over a 500 meter strike length, with further drilling required to delineate resources. In addition, drilling at the Samavogo Nord deposit was focused on extending the existing mineralisation at Samavogo to the northwest.\n-\nDuring the remainder of the year, the exploration programme will continue to focus on drilling prospective targets within close proximity to the Wahgnion mill, including additional drilling at Ouahiri South and Kassera in addition to further drilling at the Samavogo Nord target, focussed on extending mineralisation further north from the Samavogo deposit.\nLafigu\u00e9 project, on the Fetekro property\n-\nAn exploration programme of $7.0 million was planned for FY-2022, of which $6.2 million has been spent year to date, with $1.4 million spent in Q3-2022 consisting of 496 meters of drilling across 67 drillholes. The exploration programme is focused on increasing the Lafigu\u00e9 deposit resource size and delineating additional satellite targets on the Fetekro property.\n-\nFollowing successful exploration in H1-2022 at the Lafigu\u00e9 deposit, new reserves and resources were defined which were incorporated into the Lafigu\u00e9 DFS announced on 17 October 2022. A new Indicated resource of 46.3Mt at 2.03g/t for 3,027koz was defined and a Probable reserve of 49.8Mt at 1.69g/t for 2,714koz was defined, increasing the M&I resource size by 23% and the reserve size by 29% compared to the reserves and resources that were used in the 2020 PFS.\n-\nDuring Q3-2022, exploration work focussed on extending the Lafigu\u00e9 mineralised footprint towards the southwest along strike and on delineating the eight satellite targets (WA01, WA03, WA08, Central Area and Targets 4, 9, 10 and 11) that have been identified on the Fetekro property for follow up drilling.\n-\nDuring the remainder of 2022, drilling will follow up on the eight satellite targets and auger drilling is also planned to the southwest of the Lafigu\u00e9 deposit in order to test mineralised extensions of the existing resource along strike.\nKalana project\n-\nDuring Q3-2022, results of geochemical and geotechnical laboratory tests were being reviewed.\nGreenfield exploration\n-\nA greenfield exploration programme of $15.0 million was planned for FY-2022 of which $16.0 million has been spent year to date, with $6.8 million spent in Q3-2022. The exploration programme has been focused on the Tanda-Iguela project, where activities have been accelerated this year, infill drilling at the Bantou property in Burkina Faso, follow up drilling at the Siguiri property in Guinea and regional exploration reconnaissance in Senegal.\n-\nIn Burkina Faso, drilling on the Bantou exploration property continued in Q3-2022, focussed on in-filling and converting Inferred resources to Indicated status. During Q4-2022, resource modelling will incorporate new drill results, incorporating the higher grade mineralised zones identified this year. An updated resource is expected to be incorporated within the Group\u2019s year-end resource update.\n-\nIn C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, exploration focused on delineating the promising Assafou target on the Tanda-Iguela property, where 39,000 meters of drilling has been completed year to date. The ongoing drilling program aims to confirm the continuity of mineralisation and test along strike extensions of the orebodies in both directions, as well as at depth. A maiden resource estimate is expected to be published in Q4-2022.\n-\nIn Guinea, follow up drilling on the Siguiri exploration property was conducted during Q3-2022. The drill programme remains focussed on priority targets which were selected based on previous termite mound geochemical sampling, IP survey results and reconnaissance drilling results.\n-\nIn Senegal, a large scale regional soil geochemistry programme within the Bransan and Kanoumba exploration permits was completed with results under review. The regional programme was designed to identify targets for reconnaissance drilling within the Main Transcurrent Shearzone, a regional first order structure.\nBAMBARAYA TECHNICAL NOTES\nThe Bambaraya model, statistical analysis and Mineral Resource Estimate was prepared by Helen Oliver, FGS, C.Geol., Endeavour\u2019s Group Resource Geologist, a Qualified Person as defined by the National Instrument 43-101 (\u201cNI 43-101\u201d). The Bambaraya Mineral Resource Estimate (\u201cMRE\u201d) follows the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Reserves and have been completed in accordance with the Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects as defined by NI 43-101. The effective date of the MRE is 10 March 2022. The Mineral Resource is reported at a $1,500/oz gold price Whittle pit optimisation and a 0.50 g/t gold cut-off grade.\nThe Bambaraya deposit is located in the northern corner of the Massawa Mining Lease approximately 13 km south of the Sabodala-Massawa processing facility. The mineralisation, controlled by a northeast trending splay of the Sabodala Shear Zone (SSZ), is recognised over two kilometres of strike length with an average width of 250 meters. It is predominately hosted by a very steep brecciated contact zone between pillowed basalts and andesite units.\nThe Bambaraya Mineral Resource is based on a drill hole database as of 15 February 2022. The mineralisation model was developed in Geovia Surpac modelling software using geological information from 28 diamond drillholes totalling 4,641 meters completed in 2007 and 2021, and from 226 reverse circulation holes totalling 22,786 meters completed in 2010 and 2021. Seven mineralised domains were interpreted and modelled into 3D wireframes at a threshold of 0.4 g/t gold on 40 meter drill lines. The gold assays were composited to one metre intervals within the mineralised wireframes and capped at 10 g/t gold. Spatial analysis of the northern and southern gold domains using variograms indicated poor to moderate continuity; hence, gold grades were interpolated using an inverse distance squared (ID2) estimation method constrained by the mineralised wireframes. Density parameters were determined by weathering type; the saprolite was assigned a density of 2.2 t/m3, saprock 2.7 t/m3 and fresh rock 2.8 t/m3.\nNo Measured Mineral Resources were estimated. The mineralisation was classified as either Indicated or Inferred Mineral Resources depending on sample spacing, number of informing samples, confidence in mineralised zone continuity and geostatistical analysis. The Indicated Mineral Resources were defined by least three drill holes within a 50 meter search using a minimum of five and a maximum of 15 samples. Inferred mineral resource classification was defined by a minimum of three samples within a 100 meter search. The Mineral Resources were constrained by $1,500/oz gold price within a Whittle pit optimisation and a 0.50 g/t gold cut-off grade. The Whittle pit shell optimisations assumed a base mining cost of $2.00/t and an adjusted ore mining and haulage cost of $2.40/t for oxide, $2.60/t for transition and $3.00/t for fresh rock; a mining recovery of 95%; no mining dilution; a pit slope of 40 degrees; average gold recovery of 90%; a processing and G&A cost of $14.00/t for oxide, $16.00/t for transition and $18.00/t for fresh rock; and a gold selling cost (royalty, refining and selling) of $80/oz.\nMineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Reported tonnage and grade figures have been rounded from raw estimates to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimate. Minor variations may occur during the addition of rounded numbers.\nDrilling and assay procedures\nThe reverse circulation drill programme samples were collected on one metre intervals using dual tube, a percussion hammer and drop centre bit. The material passed through a cyclone which was thoroughly cleaned after every sample by flushing the hole and at the end of every drill rod run (typically three or six metres). Samples were split at the drill site using a three-tier riffle splitter with both bulk and laboratory sample weights and moisture recorded. Samples sent to the laboratory were between four and five kilogrammes in weight. Representative samples for each interval were collected with a spear, sieved into chip trays and retained for reference.\nDrill core samples were selected by Endeavour geologists and sawn in half with a diamond blade at the Massawa Exploration Camp. Half of the core was retained for reference purposes. Sample intervals were generally one metre in length.\nThe majority of the samples (from 206 drill holes) were transported by road to the ALS sample preparation laboratory in Kedougou, Senegal and then the pulps were sent to ALS Bamako, Mali in secured, poly-woven bags. A minority of samples (from 32 Phase I drill holes) were assayed at the SGS Sabodala Gold Mine laboratory for rapid turnaround. On arrival at the sample preparation laboratory, the RC and DD samples were weighed and crushed to 6 mm (70% passing), and a two-kilogramme sample taken by a rotary split which was pulverised to 75 \u03bcm (85% passing). The two kilogramme pulverised samples were analysed for gold by Fire Assay (50 g charge) with an Atomic Absorption (AA) finish.\nQuality assurance and quality control procedures\nThe sampling and assaying of Bambaraya samples were monitored through the implementation of a quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) programme with the use of Certified Reference Materials (\u201cstandards\u201d), blanks and duplicates inserted into the sample stream by Endeavour geologists. QA/QC results were reviewed on a certificate basis and \u201cfailed\u201d samples were identified and re-assayed according to the Endeavour QA/QC protocol. The Bambaraya exploration database is held within a propriety electronic secure database system with a dedicated Database Manager.\nCONFERENCE CALL AND LIVE WEBCAST\nManagement will host a conference call and webcast on Thursday 10 November, at 8:30 am EST / 1:30 pm GMT to discuss the Company's financial results.\nThe conference call and webcast are scheduled at:\n-\n5:30am in Vancouver\n-\n8:30am in Toronto and New York\n-\n1:30pm in London\n-\n9:30pm in Hong Kong and Perth\nThe webcast can be accessed through the following link:\nhttps://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/h35v7ffw\nAnalysts and investors are also invited to participate and ask questions by registering for the conference call dial-in via the following link:\nhttps://register.vevent.com/register/BI74c00e14e438439094a103def487819f\nThe conference call and webcast will be available for playback on Endeavour's website.\nQUALIFIED PERSONS\nMark Morcombe, COO of Endeavour Mining PLC., a Fellow of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, is a \"Qualified Person\" as defined by National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\") and has reviewed and approved the technical information in this news release.\nCONTACT INFORMATION\n| For Investor Relations enquiries: | For Media enquiries: |\n| Martino De Ciccio | Brunswick Group LLP in London |\n| VP \u2013 Strategy & Investor Relations | Carole Cable, Partner |\n| +442030112706 | +447974982458 |\nABOUT ENDEAVOUR MINING CORPORATION\nEndeavour Mining is one of the world\u2019s senior gold producers and the largest in West Africa, with operating assets across Senegal, Cote d\u2019Ivoire and Burkina Faso and a strong portfolio of advanced development projects and exploration assets in the highly prospective Birimian Greenstone Belt across West Africa.\nA member of the World Gold Council, Endeavour is committed to the principles of responsible mining and delivering sustainable value to its employees, stakeholders and the communities where it operates.

Two holes have been drilled to date, with a third, following up on the first completed hole, in progress. Assays are pending for all holes but are expected to be received during Q1 2023.\nFlorence Hill Exploration Program Update Summary\nThe first drill hole (FH22-001), drilled into the main Florence Hill exploration target, intersected significant structurally-hosted epithermal quartz-calcite-(gypsum) veinlets at the top of the hole, along strike of the nearby Gold Road and West Oatman Veins. In addition, the hole intersected porphyry-style alteration transitioning from propylitic to phyllic accompanied by an increase in alteration intensity with downhole depth\nThe second drill hole (HV22-001), drilled into the Hardy Vein target approximately 1,300 meters to the west of the main Florence Hill target, intersected a three meter-thick epithermal quartz-calcite vein within a more than 90 meters thick zone of vein stockwork at depths of between 94-187 meters downhole. The vein and vein stockwork intersected in this drill hole is similar to the Moss Vein and mineralized epithermal veins historically mined in the Oatman District (e.g., Ransome, 1923).\nA third drill hole (FH22-002) is currently underway on the main Florence Hill target which is testing, at depth, the epithermal veining intersected at the top of FH22-001\nThe Company is investigating the relationship between the strong alteration intersected in drill hole FH22-001, geomagnetic and radiometric anomalies, and surface geochemistry results for follow-up drilling optimization\nThe Florence Hill exploration area is located approximately 3.5 kilometers southeast of the Moss mine (see Figure 1: Claims Overview Map) in Mohave County, Arizona. The area is readily accessed via Silver Creek Road, which connects Bullhead City to Oatman. A block of patented claims, owned by the Company, is located approximately 500 meters to the west of the main Florence Hill exploration target. Several epithermal quartz-calcite veins and stockwork zones, including the Hardy Vein, are present on the surface in these claims, strike towards the main Florence Hill target, and are associated with historic mine workings. The two drill holes completed to date as part of the Florence Hill Exploration Program, FH22-001 and HV22-001, were drilled into the main Florence Hill and Hardy Vein targets, respectively.\nMain Florence Hill Exploration Target\nThe first diamond drill hole (FH22-001) at the Florence Hill project was collared southeast of the topographic feature known as Florence Hill, primarily targeting steeply dipping, northwest striking structures hosting epithermal quartz-calcite veins, including the structures that host the Gold Road deposit, approximately 3,600 meters to the southeast, and the West Oatman vein, approximately 1,300 meters to the northwest (see Figure 2: Collar Location Map). The hole was drilled to the northeast with a dip of -45 degrees and was completed to a downhole depth of almost 1,100 meters.\nThe drill hole intersected fault-hosted epithermal veining in the upper 370 meters, including several intermittent vein stockwork zones in the first 30 meters, followed by variably altered volcanic and intrusive host rock to depth of drilling. Hydrothermal alteration displays an apparent transition to higher temperature porphyry-style alteration (propylitic to phyllic), accompanied by an increase in alteration intensity, with depth.\nThe hole was originally planned to end at a downhole depth of around 610 meters but was extended due to the presence and transitional nature of the hydrothermal alteration intersected, and the apparent \"vectoring\" of the alteration assemblages towards magnetic and radiometric geophysical anomalies, generated in the recently completed Moss Project airborne geophysical survey (see Figure 3: Airborne Magnetic Reduced to Pole First Vertical Derivative; Figure 4: Airborne Radiometric Survey K Concentration).\nDetailed core logging has been completed. Cutting and sampling of the drill core is ongoing, and samples are being shipped to the ALS Global laboratory in Tucson, Arizona for multi-element plus gold analysis. Results are expected to be received in Q1 2023.\nDr. Warwick S. Board, Vice President of Exploration for Elevation Gold, stated \"We are excited about the multiple vein, stockwork, and alteration features intersected throughout the length of the first hole drilling into the Florence Hill target. It seems that the upperparts of the structural system that contains both the West Oatman and Gold Road vein hosting structures was intersected towards the top of this hole. We intend to conduct step-back drilling to test the structure at greater depths, especially given the tendency of key mineralized epithermal veins in the historic Oatman District (e.g., United Eastern, Tom Reed, Gold Road) to open into mineralized features from depths of between approximately 50 to 110 meters below surface. Furthermore, the change in nature and intensity of the alteration intersected in the hole with depth and towards coincident surface geochemistry and airborne geophysical anomalies suggests vectoring towards a potential porphyry-style system.\"\nHardy Vein Exploration Target\nCore drilling on the second diamond drill hole in the Florence Hill area has been completed. The second hole (HV22-001) collared approximately 1,300 meters west of FH22-001 (see Figure 2: Collar Location Map), on the Company's patented claims (also known as the \"McCullough\" patents). Hole HV22-001 was drilled on an azimuth to the south-southeast (162 degrees) and a dip of -45 degrees, targeting the Hardy Vein and associated stockworks veining. Hole HV22-001 intersected intermittent structurally-hosted quartz-calcite stockworks, followed by a three-meter-thick epithermal quartz-calcite vein at a depth of around 95 meters downhole. Intermittent quartz-calcite-fluorite veining and stockwork zones up to approximately one meter thick are present to almost 190 meters downhole. The hole was completed to a downhole depth of 396 meters. Detailed core logging, cutting, and sampling is ongoing, when complete, samples will be shipped to ALS Global in Tucson, AZ.\nFollow-up Exploration Drilling \u2013 Florence Hill Exploration Target\nThe third diamond drill hole of the project has been collared approximately 270 meters southwest of hole FH22-001 (see Figure 2: Collar Location Map). The hole has been planned to test the deeper parts of the significant quartz-calcite vein stockwork structure intersected in the upper 30 meters of hole FH22-001. This hole will test the Company's thesis that the structure is potentially the continuation of the structural zone that hosts the Gold Road deposit to the southeast and the West Oatman vein to the northwest.\nUpcoming Diamond Drill Hole Plan\nFollowing completion of the third hole, Elevation Gold plans to move the drill to the northside of Florence Hill to better access the anomalies highlighted in the recent airborne geophysical survey (see Figure 3: Airborne Magnetic Reduced to Pole First Vertical Derivative and Figure 4: Airborne Radiometric Survey K Concentration), and to test a target in the Grapevine area that has been recently identified via reconnaissance geologic mapping (see Figure 2: Collar Location Map). The Grapevine area is approximately 2,300 meters from the main Florence Hill exploration target and is characterized by steep quartz veining cutting stockwork associated with jarosite, quartz, kaolinite, and sericite. The Company plans on drilling two holes to test the geophysical anomalies in the main Florence Hill exploration target area (one into each of the magnetic and radiometric features of interest), as well as one hole to test the veining and stockwork zone in the Grapevine area.\nStock Option Grant\nThe Company reports that stock options have been granted to directors, officers, and employees of the Company to purchase up to an aggregate of 400,000 common shares at a price of C$0.18 per share for a period of five years.\nQualified Persons\nUnless otherwise indicated, all technical data contained in this press release that relates to geology, exploration and mineral resources has been reviewed and approved by Dr. Warwick Board, P.Geo, Vice President Exploration of Elevation Gold.

No Measured resources have been estimated. Mineral Resources estimates follow the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (\"CIM\") definitions standards for mineral resources and have been completed in accordance with the Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects as defined by National Instrument 43-101. Reported tonnage and grade figures have been rounded from raw estimates to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimate. Minor variations may occur during the addition of rounded numbers. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Resources were constrained by $1,500/oz gold price MII Pit Shell and based on a cut-off of 0.5 g/t Au.\nSignificant exploration potential exists at the Assafou deposit since it is open along strike in both directions and at depth. The delineated Indicated resource encompasses only 20% of the identified mineralised system which covers an area three kilometres long by 350 metres wide. As such, an aggressive exploration drilling campaign is scheduled to begin in 2023, with an additional 50,000 metres expected to be conducted on the Assafou deposit, compared to the 58,000 metres of drilling, which formed the basis of the maiden resource calculation. In addition, a drilling programme of 20,000 metres is planned to test the additional nearby targets identified to date. These efforts are expected to yield an updated resource estimate in 2023 and increase the overall geological understanding of the area.\nS\u00e9bastien de Montessus, President and CEO commented: \u201cWe are thrilled with the maiden resource at our Tanda-Iguela greenfield property in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire. It ranks as one of the most significant discoveries made in West Africa over the last decade and shows potential to be another flagship asset for the company.\nThis discovery builds on our recent success discovering the Lafigu\u00e9 project, where construction was recently launched, and reinforces our ability to organically source our project pipeline through ongoing exploration success. Additionally, this discovery showcases West Africa\u2019s geological potential, which is a key reason behind its rapid growth into the largest gold producing region globally. As the largest gold producer in West Africa, we have developed a strong competitive advantage in the region, strategically positioning us to continue to unlock value over the long term.\nWith this new important discovery and exploration success across our portfolio, we are well on track to achieve our target of discovering between 15 to 20 million ounces for the 5-year period ending in 2025.\u201d\nPatrick Bouisset, Executive Vice President Exploration and Growth said: \u201cAfter securing long mine lives at our flagship mines through brownfield exploration, we were excited to significantly increase our focus on greenfield exploration this year, with the goal of feeding our project pipeline following the commencement of construction at Lafigu\u00e9.\nFollowing promising drill results late last year, Tanda-Iguela quickly became a stronger strategic focus in 2022, and we were able to quickly shift our efforts to accelerate its drilling by leveraging our presence and competitive advantage in the region. As such, we are thrilled to have quickly delineated a maiden resource of 1.1Moz at Indicated status and a further 1.9Moz at Inferred status, following our first significant drilling campaign on the asset, at an industry low discovery cost of less than $10 per Indicated ounce.\nSignificant exploration potential exists on the Tanda-Iguela property with the Assafou deposit located over a structural trend extending over 15 kilometres and remaining open in all directions with at least 10 additional exploration targets identified nearby. To both delineate further resources at Assafou and test new targets, we are preparing to launch an aggressive 70,000-metre drilling programme next year.\nBased on the initial analysis of the ore characteristics and orebody shape, we believe it should be amenable to open pit mining as mineralisation starts at surface, whilst preliminary metallurgical test work done to date suggests the potential for very high gold recovery rates. The geological context, coupled with the occurrence of greater than 30-metre thick high grade intercepts at depth, also suggests the possibility for future underground mining potential.\u201d\nABOUT THE TANDA-IGUELA PROPERTY\nThe Tanda-Iguela property is located in the Eastern part of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire within the Boundounkou Birimian greenstone belt, approximately 400 kilometres to the Northeast of Abidjan and 30 kilometres from the border with Ghana. The property is composed of two exploration permits, as shown in Figure 1 in the attached PDF.\nThe Tanda permit, covering 395 km2, was introduced into Endeavour\u2019s portfolio in late 2015 following the transaction with La Mancha. The first exploration work was initiated in the early 2000s, by the previous owner, resulting in the identification of several targets through the geochemical campaigns (9,056 samples collected) and following a sparse drilling campaign which comprised 1,346 metres of Auger drilling over 136 holes, 7,410 metres of Reverse Circulation (\u201cRC\u201d) drilling over 79 holes and 1,627 metre Diamond Drilling (\u201cDD\u201d) over 19 holes.\nEndeavour conducted an initial small drilling campaign in early 2016 with 5,324 metres of RC drilling over 76 holes on the Tanda permit. This programme yielded strong results and the grounds adjacent to the Tanda permit were quickly identified as being highly prospective with the possibility to delineate a resource of critical size to justify a standalone operation.\nAs such, Endeavour consolidated the area in May 2017 by being awarded the Iguela permit, covering 298 km2, through the permitting application process. Shortly after, during 2018 and 2019 an initial geochemical campaign, comprised of 3,436 samples, was conducted over the Iguela permit. This campaign coupled with considerable fieldwork and mapping outlined a series of significant potential gold occurrences and exploration targets over the tenement package, as shown in Figure 1 in the attached PDF, with the most attractive anomalies located right over the structural contact, extending over more than 15 kilometres, and separating the Birimian volcanics and the Tarkwaian sediments.\nDue to the exciting positive initial assay results from the Assafou target, including multiple thick high-grade gold intercepts, most of the drilling was quickly focused on the target to define a maiden resource which is based on a total of 303 drillholes amounting to 58,388 metres.\nIn addition, ten other exploration targets have been identified within the Tanda-Iguela exploration licenses, and at least two (Broukro and Gbabango) are directly on trend with the prolific Assafou mineralised system, as shown in Figure 1 in the attached PDF.\nABOUT THE ASSAFOU DISCOVERY\nThe delineated resource for the Assafou deposit is very robust, due to its relative high-grade and continuous mineralisation, as demonstrated with the sensitivity analysis performed at various gold prices, presented in Table 2 below.\nTable 2: Assafou Mineral Resource Estimate Sensitivity\n|\n| TONNAGE | GRADE | CONTENT |\n|\n| (Mt) | (Au g/t) | (Au koz) |\n| INDICATED RESOURCE |\n|\n|\n|\n| Based on a gold price of $1,300/oz | 14.8 | 2.33 | 1,109 |\n| Based on a gold price of $1,500/oz | 14.9 | 2.33 | 1,114 |\n| Based on a gold price of $1,700/oz | 14.9 | 2.33 | 1,115 |\n| Based on a gold price of $1,900/oz | 14.9 | 2.33 | 1,116 |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| INFERRED RESOURCE |\n|\n|\n|\n| Based on a gold price of $1,300/oz | 30.1 | 1.84 | 1,780 |\n| Based on a gold price of $1,500/oz | 32.9 | 1.80 | 1,903 |\n| Based on a gold price of $1,700/oz | 33.8 | 1.79 | 1,942 |\n| Based on a gold price of $1,900/oz | 35.0 | 1.77 | 1,990 |\nMineral Resource Estimate current as at 31 October 2022. No Measured resources have been estimated. Mineral Resources estimates follow the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (\"CIM\") definitions standards for mineral resources and have been completed in accordance with the Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects as defined by National Instrument 43-101. Reported tonnage and grade figures have been rounded from raw estimates to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimate. Minor variations may occur during the addition of rounded numbers. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Resources were constrained by MII $1,500/oz Pit Shell and for sensitivity purpose by MII $1,300/oz, $1,700/oz and $1,900/oz pit shells and based on a cut-off of 0.5 g/t Au.\nAs shown in Figure 2 in the attached PDF, the Assafou mineralised system has now been defined over an area which is approximately three kilometres in length and 350 metres in width, extending from surface to depths exceeding 300 metres. The 2022 delineated Indicated resource covers only 600 metres of the defined mineralised area with the deposit remaining open along strike in both directions, as well as at depth.\nThe Assafou deposit is hosted within Tarkwaian Sediments (sandstones) at or immediately in the vicinity of a major structural contact with mafic Birimian rocks. As shown in Figures 3, 4 and 5 in the attached PDF, the deposit comprises a main thick (up to 60 metre) continuous lense, appearing to be low angle to flat-lying, overlaid by a series of stacked low angle dipping lenses, that are distributed from the surface (in the saprolite) down to over 200 metres depth, recognised so far. Some of the best holes drilled in the thicker part of the mineralisation delivered total cumulative intercepts exceeding 90 to 100 metres in true thickness with an average grade above 3.00g/t gold.\nAs shown in Figure 6 in the attached PDF, step back drilling returned high-grade intercepts, very close to the structural contact, outside of the current resource boundary, confirming that mineralisation is still open towards the Northwest. Some high grade mineralised intercepts were also encountered in this area at great depth (> 300-metre vertical) close to the main structural contact, as demonstrated by Hole IGRCDD22-204 with intercepts of 29.7 metres at 6.36 g/t gold.\nAs shown in Figures 7 and 8 in the attached PDF, the mineralised system was also identified to continue over two kilometres away from the delineated Indicated resource area, towards the southeast. Ground geophysical surveys (including magnetic, IP-Resistivity and gravity) are currently on-going over the Assafou target with the goal of outlining the contact between the sandstones and the mafic rocks, and to better identify the extensions of the deposit.\nIn the Figures in the attached PDF, the parameters used to calculate the composites are: a cut-off sample of 0.3 g/t gold, a minimum value composite of 0.5 g/t gold, a dilution of two metres, a minimum composite length of two metres, and the including is based on a > 10g/t gold filter. Composite interval represent calculated downhole (true) thickness.\nPRELIMINARY METALLURGY\nPreliminary metallurgical tests, completed at Endeavour\u2019s Ity mine, included five Assafou variability samples representative of the so far identified ore resource facies: (1) perched lens \u2013 medium grade, (2) perched lens \u2013 high grade, (3) thick lens - medium grade, (4) thick lens - high grade, and (5) saprock. Testwork focussed on gravity gold recovery with cyanidation of the gravity tail. Gold recoveries were high from all facies with high gravity gold recovery of between 55% to 75%, and high overall gold extractions of above 95%.\nThe Assafou deposit appears to be monometallic containing no potentially penalising elements associated with the gold.\nNEXT STEPS\n-\nComprehensive ground and airborne geophysical surveys (including magnetic, IP-Resistivity and gravity) are being designed and will be executed in 2023.\n-\nAn aggressive drilling delineation campaign is planned for 2023 over the Assafou target, with at least 50,000 metres of RC and DD expected to be conducted.\n-\nIn addition, 20,000 metres of drilling is planned for 2023 to test some of the 10 additional targets, on which very limited exploration has been conducted to date. Information received is expected to orient a second phase of more systematic exploration on the best identified targets.\nTECHNICAL NOTES\nAssafou Geology\nWithin the Assafou deposit, gold mineralisation occurs both within a network of quartz veins and breccia crosscutting the sandstones, and as disseminated occurrences within pervasively altered sandstones. The Tarkwaian sandstones have been subject to several alteration phases comprising early white mica crystallisation (in both barren and mineralised sandstones), often followed by a silicification episode coeval with gold deposition and a later carbonatation (in both barren and mineralised sandstones). Gold is closely associated with pyrite \u00b1 chalcopyrite and, very locally, galena. The more intense the silicification (and presence of pyrite), the more mineralised the sandstones tend to be.\nThe gold-bearing quartz vein network appears to have developed during the reverse reactivation of the initial normal basin border fault separating the sandstones (in the hanging wall) from the Birimian basement. Mineralising hydrothermal fluids filled the open spaces and fractures induced by the fault-related compressive stress regime and mostly invaded the sandstones, which displayed a higher initial remaining porosity/permeability and competency than the mafic rocks.\nAssafou Resource Modelling\nThe statistical analysis, geological modelling and resource estimation were prepared by the Endeavour resource team, under the direction of Kevin Harris (CPG) VP Resources for Endeavour as the Qualified Person as defined by NI 43-101.\nThe Assafou Mineral Resource model was developed in Seequent\u2019s Leapfrog Geo and Maptek Vulcan software. The database used to generate the Mineral Resources comprised some 303 drillholes, with a total drilling meterage of 58,388 metres. The majority of the available drillhole data were drilled in 2022 and supported by industry standard quality assurance and quality control systems, with quality control sampling comprising blanks, coarse blanks, certified reference materials, and field and pulp duplicates. Resource team has reviewed the QAQC data and are confident they are of high standard to be used in resource estimation.\nMineralisation domains were modelled using geology and grade continuity as veins, by selecting intervals which forms part of each mineralisation lenses; a nominal cut-off of 0.5g/t together with presence of Silica Alteration or quartz vein zones were used. The gold assays from the drillholes were composited to 1.0 metre intervals within the modelled veins. Capping varied depending on the mineralised domain, between no cap and 45g/t.\nDensity measurements from 38 drillholes for total 751 samples and covering each of the material type and major lithologies, were averaged based on the material type. Average density values were applied to the associated portions of the block model as outlined below:\n-\nLaterite: 1.62 g/cm3\n-\nSaprolite: 1.62 g/cm3\n-\nSaprock: 2.38 g/cm3\n-\nFresh: 2.75 g/cm3\nGold grades were estimated using Inverse Distances Squared for all the modelled mineralisation and estimated in multiple passes to define the higher confidence areas and extend the grade to the interpreted mineralised zone extents. Any block not estimated after the Third pass is left as waste block.\nThe grade estimation was validated with visual and statistical analysis, and comparison with the drilling data on sections with swath plots comparing the block grades with the composites.\nThe quality and spatial distribution of the data used and the geological continuity of the mineralisation and the quality of the estimated block model for Assafou is sufficient for the reporting of Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources, Indicated Mineral Resources have typically been defined in areas with a drillhole spacing of 30-40 metres along sections, and 40-50 metres between sections, where there is a reasonable level of confidence in geological and grade continuity. Inferred Mineral Resources have typically been defined in areas with a drillhole spacing of 50 to 80 metres, and where the continuity is much reduced.\nMineral Resources are reported within a Whittle optimised pit shell using cut-off of grades of 0.5 g/t gold. Optimisation parameters used are as below:\n-\nOre mining cost: $2.10/t Oxide; $2.40/t Transition; $3.12/t for Fresh\n-\nWaste mining cost: $3.00/t\n-\nProcessing cost: Oxide/Transition: $9.30/t; Fresh: $11.00/t\n-\nSelling cost: $80/oz gold\n-\nMining recovery: 95%\n-\nMining dilution: 0%\n-\nStrip ratio: 5.9\n-\nProcessing recovery: Varies dependent on head grade. Averages 92% for each of the three material types\n-\nAverage slope angles: 43\u00b0\n-\nG&A cost: $5.60/t processed\nDrilling, Assay, Quality Assurance / Quality Control Procedures\nReverse Circulation (\u201cRC\u201d) and Air Core (\u201cAC\u201d) drilling delivers material to the surface via percussion hammer pushing pulverized rock into dule tube rods which evacuate the material to the surface via high pressure compressed air.\nThe samples are collected from the cyclone at surface at 1-metre intervals. The cyclone is cleaned after every 6-metre rod by flushing the hole. Additional manual cleaning is required in saprolitic or wet ground, closely monitored by the site geologist / geotechnician to ensure no sample to sample contamination occurs.\nSamples are split at the drill site using several different riffle splitters, based on bulk sample weight. 2-5kg laboratory and a second 2-5kg reference sample are collected. Bulk and laboratory sample weights, in addition to moisture levels are recorded. Representative samples for each interval were collected with a spear, sieved into chip trays and retained for reference.\nDrill core (PQ, HQ and NQ size) samples are selected by Endeavour geologists and sawn in half with a diamond blade at the project site. Half of the core is retained at the site for reference purposes. Sample intervals are generally 1 metre in length.\nAll samples are transported by road to Bureau Veritas in Abidjan. Each laboratory sample is secured in poly-woven bags ensuring that there is a clear record of the chain of custody. On arrival samples are weighed. Complete samples are crushed to 2 mm (70% passing) with 1 kg split out for pulverization. The entire 1 kg is pulverized 75\u03bcm (85% passing). A 50 gram sample is extracted and analysed for gold using standard fire assay technique. An Atomic Absorption (\u201cAA\u201d) finish provides the final gold value.\nBlanks, field duplicates and certified reference material (\u201cCRM\u2019s\u201d) are inserted into the sample sequence by Endeavour geologists at a rate of 1 of each samples type per 20 samples. This ensures that there is a 5% Quality Assurance / Quality Control (\u201cQA/QC\u201d) sample insertion rate applied to each fire assay batch. The sampling and assaying are monitored through analysis of these QA/QC samples. This QA/QC program was audited by a consultant, independent from Endeavour Mining and has been verified to follow industry best practices.\nIn September 2022, 1,758 samples were sent to ALS Ouagadougou for umpire (referee) analysis. Comparison of the Original analysis against the umpire analysis revealed a very strong Correlation Coefficient of 96% suggesting that the original assays provided by Bureau Veritas in Abidjan are accurate. Core sampling and assay data were monitored through a quality assurance/quality control program designed to follow NI 43-101 and industry best practice.\nFull drill results are available by clicking here.\nQUALIFIED PERSONS\nThe scientific and technical content of this news release has been reviewed, verified and compiled by Silvia Bottero, Professional Natural Scientist, VP Exploration C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire for Endeavour Mining.

The conversion drilling program, targeting Inferred Mineral Resources (\"Inferred Resources\") along the southern extension of the Fruta del Norte deposit, aims to extend the mine life by converting Inferred Resources. Results obtained have confirmed the wide, consistent nature of mineralization throughout the southern sector and have also generated new targets outside of the resource envelope for further work as part of the Company's near mine program. PDF Version\nRon Hochstein, President and CEO, commented, \"I am pleased to announce these exciting drill results, which have confirmed the continuity of mineralization along the southern extension of our current Inferred Resources and will support the completion of a Mineral Reserve and Resource update and subsequent 43-101 report, anticipated to be released in the first quarter of 2023. Additionally, several of these results suggest that Fruta del Norte remains open at depth and underlines the significant potential for resource growth through the near mine exploration program.\"\nCONVERSION DRILLING PROGRAM\nSince 2021, the Company has been advancing its conversion program at Fruta del Norte, with the objective of converting Inferred Resources to Measured or Indicated Resources. The Fruta del Norte deposit is currently estimated to contain a large Inferred Resource of approximately 11.6 million tonnes averaging 5.69 grams per tonne (\"g/t\") gold, containing 2,130,300 ounces of gold. A total of 18,340 metres of underground drilling across 88 drill holes has been completed, the results of which will improve confidence in and further support the geological model and assist the Company in preparing an update to the current Mineral Reserve and Resource estimate at Fruta del Norte.\nNumerous drill holes returned high grade intercepts associated with a hydrothermal alteration zone with veins, veinlets and minor breccias or stockwork zones hosted by a volcanic rock domain (see Table 1). These results confirm that the mineralized zone extends a further 300 metres past the current Fruta del Norte Mineral Reserve boundary, in the southern direction (see Figure 1). Some of the most notable results include the following drill intercepts (not true width):\n12.57 g/t of gold over 101.30 metres (FDN22-229)\n10.76 g/t of gold over 163.20 metres (FDN21-112)\n12.67 g/t of gold over 98.30 metres (FDN21-165)\n17.93 g/t of gold over 51.45 metres (FDN22-198)\nComplete assay results for the entire conversion drilling program can be found in Tables 3 and 4 in the Appendix.\nResults from the conversion program allow for better delineation of the distribution and controls of higher-grade mineralized zones within the known Inferred Resource and significantly enhance the southern extension in the current geological model. The Company is in the process of analyzing the full set of this data with the objective of preparing an updated estimate of Mineral Reserves and Resources for Fruta del Norte in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 (\"NI 43-101\") by the end of the first quarter of 2023. Based on the new geological model, further conversion drilling targets will be defined for 2023 and 2024.\nTable 1: Highlights of Fruta del Norte conversion drilling for intervals greater than 3.5 g/t1 and minimum drilling length of 4 metres.

These drilling intercepts from the deepest boundary of the Fruta del Norte mineral resource envelope indicate that the deposit remains open at depth. The results have defined new potential areas for resource growth, below the defined mineral resource envelope in the north sector and along the southern extension (see Figure 2).\nMost of the drilling results obtained are of a hydrothermal alteration similar to that occurring in Fruta del Norte's Mineral Reserves, where the mine is currently operating (see Table 2). In the northern part of the deposit, drill holes intercepted wide hydrothermal alteration zones represented by breccias, veining or stockwork zones, very similar in style and geometry to that found in the area currently being mined. In the southern extension, the Fruta del Norte deposit changes to a veining dominant style hosted in volcanic rocks, with drilling results suggesting potential for growth along the downdip continuity.\nThe near mine program currently has one underground rig turning, which is further investigating the continuity of the Fruta del Norte system at depth, in both the north and south sectors. In addition to the underground rig, the program includes two surface rigs testing the southerly extension of Fruta del Norte. To the end of October, 6,190 metres have been drilled on this program.\nTable 2: Highlights from Fruta del Norte drilling at depth for intervals greater than 3.5 g/t1 and minimum drilling length of 4 metres.

The Company's financial results are reported and available on SEDAR as well as on the Company's website (www.cerradogold.com).\nQ3 2022 Financial and Operational Highlights (All numbers reported in US$)\nProduction of 11,015 ounces of gold in Q3 2022 (11,284 Gold Equivalent Ounces (\"GEO\"), in-line with annual guidance of 45,000 - 55,000 ounces of production\nAISC of $1,494 per ounce of gold sold due to higher stripping costs, lower throughput and higher labor costs during the quarter; costs expected to be significantly reduced in the fourth quarter\nQ3 adjusted EBITDA of $0.7 million primarily due to higher operating costs\nMark Brennan, CEO and Co-Chairman stated: \"Q3 provided challenges as we integrated new pits, increased strip ratios and incurred increased labor costs. We expect unit operating costs to have peaked with the fourth quarter looking particularity strong and note that production levels are within our range of guidance for 2022. Our heap leach pad construction has commenced and we believe this is the first step towards bringing stronger long term operating metrics to MDN. In Brazil, work continues to upgrade the resources at Monte Do Carmo while feasibility works are progressing as planned.\"\nThird Quarter 2022 Operational and Financial Performance\nMinera Don Nicolas The Company produced 11,015 ounces of gold and 22,419 ounces of silver during the three month period ended September 30, 2022, as compared to 11,296 ounces of gold and 28,721 ounces of silver in the second quarter of 2022. Ounces produced in the quarter were consistent with the second quarter, however, the slight decrease was primarily related to a decrease in throughput at the mill. Although mine production rates showed a slight decrease at the start of the quarter, planning and management intervention has ensured that mining numbers ended in line with expectations at the end of the quarter. As the new pits are further developed, we expect grades and throughput rates to improve in the fourth quarter of the year. Gold production was 8% higher than the corresponding period in 2022, due to improvements in both head grade and recovery, as the Company produced 10,168 ounces of gold and 28,595 ounces of silver in the three months ended September 30, 2021.\nThe average gold head grade of 4.40 grams per tonne (\"g/t\") represents a 28% increase on the 3.44 g/t head grade achieved in the second quarter of 2022 and a 23% increase as compared to the average head grade of 3.57 g/t recorded in the third quarter of 2021. The average silver head grade of 11.58 g/t represents a 16% increase quarter on quarter and an 11% decrease as compared to the average silver head grade of 13.01 g/t recorded in the third quarter of 2021. Mill throughput of 98,918 tonnes of ore represents a 4% decrease over the second quarter of 2022 and a 3% decrease in throughput as compared to the third quarter of 2021.\nMonte Do Carmo Project In Brazil, the Company continues to focus on numerous fronts to support the completion of the Feasibility Study (\"FS\") at Monte do Carmo. Infill drilling continued in the quarter and to November 10th Cerrado completed 26,405 metres as well as 14,174 metres of exploratory drilling and 3,480 metres of sterilization drilling with the use of 5 drill rigs. To date, assay results from 97 complete infill drill holes have been received, and results to date continue to support the conversion of Inferred Resources to the Measured and Indicated resource categories. In addition, four exploratory drill holes to the east of the East Zone at Serra Alta returned anomalous assay grades defining a new mineralized zone called E3. The discovery drill hole FSZ-008 presented a remarkable composite of 13.23m@ 5.53 Au g/t, demonstrating potential expansion of the resource base to the east at Serra Alta. An additional 6,300 meters of drilling were added to the overall 2022 drilling program to target potential areas to expand the Indicated and inferred resources at Serra Alta.\nExploration drilling continues at MDC targeting extensional and satellite zones like Gogo de Onca (\"Gogo\") and the newly discovered E3 target. The Company announced on November 21 the discovery hole at E3; a 150m step out corridor to the east of the East Zone, that according to preliminary continuity models indicate it could have approximately 250 m of strike length. To date, the Company has received 24 complete drill hole results from the Gogo target. Initial drilling results at the Gogo target are encouraging as the main mineralization controls seen at the Serra Alta deposit are replicated at Gogo. 6,745 meters have been drilled to November 10th. The remarkable results at Gogo include; FGO-004 25.09m@ 3.38 Au g/t, FGO-008 - 12.49m@ 3.39 Au g/t and FGO-12 11.69m@ 5.37 Au g/t. The company will continue to work at Gogo with geological modeling, and has completed a shipment of 115 Kg of mineralized material from core to perform metallurgical test work.\nThe Company has also completed its Environmental Impact Studies (\"EIS\") for the Serra Alta deposit at MDC and filed a full report in July 2022 with the local environmental authorities, NATURATINS. After receiving approval from NATURATINS, public hearings will be held with the local community followed by an application for the Preliminary License (\"PL\") followed rapidly thereafter by the Installation License (\"IL\").\nFinancial Results The Company generated revenue of $17.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 from the sale of 10,522 ounces of gold and 22,355 ounces of silver at an average realized price per gold ounce sold of $1,652 and average price per silver ounce sold of $19.49. This compares with second quarter revenue of $20.3 million, from the sale of 10,981 ounces of gold and 27,775 ounces of silver at an average realized price per gold ounce sold of $1,795 and average price per silver ounce sold of $22.43. The prices realized represents an 8% decrease as compared to second quarter of 2022 primarily as a result of a decrease in gold prices during the quarter.\nCash operating costs per ounce sold was $1,461 per ounce in the three months ended September 30, 2022, which represents a 6% increase on the $1,376 per ounce achieved in Q2 2022. The primary drivers of the increase in costs were a higher strip ratio, increase in labor rates in Argentina, and an increase in the cost of operational contractors and materials. The strip ratio of 14.9:1 for the three months ended September 30, 2022, was higher than the 12.32:1 achieved in the second quarter of 2022. The increase is primarily related to the opening of the new pits and was 16% higher as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $0.7 million in the third quarter of 2022 which is a $2.3 million reduction quarter on quarter due to the lower production and a lower gold sales price over the period. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $1.9 million as compared to the $2.6 million adjusted EBITDA recorded in the third quarter 2021. Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 represented a $10 million improvement as compared to the nine months ended 2021.\nThe Company incurred general and administrative expenses of $2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022, a $0.4 million increase compared to the general and administrative expenses incurred during the three month period ended September 30, 2021. During the three months ended September 30, 2022, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to an increase in non-cash shared-based payments of $0.6 million, offset by lower professional and consulting fees of $0.2 million.\nOther expenses included a $1.1 million increase in finance expense, primarily as a result of the interest expense on the secured note payable which closed in the first quarter of 2022, and interest on the loan payable which closed in the third quarter of 2022, offset by a net foreign exchange gain of $0.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2022, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021.\nNet loss for the three months ended September 30, 2022, was $6.6 million as compared to a Net loss of $1.5 million in the second quarter on 2022 and a $1.4 million net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2021.\nCapital expenditure for the quarter was $2.9m and $7.0m for the nine months ended September 30, 2022.\nBasic and diluted loss per share for the three months ended September 30, 2022, was $0.08, compared to the basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.02 for the second quarter of 2022 and a $0.02 loss for the three months ended September 30, 2021, differences are driven by underlying production from the mine as well as a result of higher finance expenses.\nReview of Technical Information The scientific and technical information in this press release has been reviewed and approved by Sergio Gelcich, P.Geo., Vice President, Exploration for Cerrado Gold Inc., who is a Qualified Person as defined in National Instrument 43-101.\nAbout Cerrado Cerrado is a Toronto based gold production, development and exploration company focused on gold projects in the Americas.

Drilling results reveal significant gold mineralization in veins within sedimentary rocks with good gold grades near surface and high-grade gold values encountered at depth.\n\u201cWhat we find exciting about this discovery is that the host rock of these veins is very different than the host rock for 98% of Grey Fox\u2019s estimated gold resources of 1.2 million ounces Indicated and 240,000 ounces Inferred.

This important regional feature is associated with approximately 3.5 million ounces of gold (past production plus current mineral resources) in the immediate area of Grey Fox.\nFigure 1 \u2013 Grey Fox - Gibson Target Area Within the Southeast Trending Flexure of the DPFZ\nThe four new Grey Fox - Gibson zone veins occur as shallow as 150 meters (m) below surface and, so far, have been traced down to 330 m. The drill core values (assays) are robust and include near surface intersections of 13.1 grams per tonne (g/t) gold (Au) over 7.3 m and 6.3g/tAu over 5.0 m; and at depth of 29.1 g/t Au over 1.8 m. The advantages of such a shallow location are reduced time and expense for establishing mineral resources and for future mine development.\nIn our 2021 drilling, hole 21GF-1333 assayed 5.6 g/t Au over 10.2 m in sediments, and 250 m to the southwest, hole 21GF-1356 assayed 5.2 g/t Au over 3.1 m core length also in sediments. Five drill holes from this year\u2019s program have encountered high-grade intercepts or visible gold outside the boundary of our existing gold resources (Table 1). These collective results appear to be on strike and have opened a large corridor of prospective ground. Interpreted dimensions of the Gibson target area extends at least 475 m along strike and to at least 300 m depth. Such dimensions represent a meaningful opportunity for significant resource additions (Figure 2 and 3).\nFor Geologists\nDrilling has encountered multiple quartz veins hosting visible gold and up to 3% sulfides within sericite and carbonate-altered sediments. In some cases, the veins are brecciated and have crustiform (layered or void-filling) textures that are characteristic of Grey Fox. These observations support our interpretation that the veins are an extension of the Grey Fox deposit, are steeply NW-dipping and trending in a NE-SW direction.\nLocated within the Gibson target area is a surface ramp constructed more than 30 years ago that was used by a previous operator to take a bulk sample and recovered 2,900 oz from 8,500 tonnes with a reported grade of more than 10 g/t Au. The low gold price at that time likely discouraged further development.\nThis area will be one of our exploration priorities in 2023.\nFigure 2 \u2013 Plan View of Grey Fox - Gibson Target Area Including Historic Ramp\nTechnical information pertaining to the Fox Complex exploration contained in this news release has been prepared under the supervision of Sean Farrell, P.Geo., a Qualified Person as defined by Canadian Securities Administrators National Instrument 43-101 \"Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.\" Fox Complex drilling (including the Grey Fox Program) was supervised by McEwen\u2019s Geology Department.

Using the grades defined in our most recent mineral resource estimate (being the Windfall MRE (2022) reflecting drill results available as of June 7, 2022), the numbers are robust, with a C$1.2 Billion after-tax net present value (\u201cNPV\u201d) and 34% after-tax unlevered internal rate of return (\u201cIRR\u201d), using US$1,600 oz gold. As we move to complete the EIA study in Q1 2023 and begin the permitting process, we expect to advance our underground exploration and continue to grow the scale and quality of the deposit. The Corporation anticipates the announcement of project financing plans in H1 2023 and a production decision in early 2024.\nOsisko would like to thank our employees and contractors for their tremendous work over the past seven years to arrive at this important point in our project, and express our gratitude to our hosts the Cree First Nation of Waswanipi, as well as the community of Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon, and the many Qu\u00e9bec government agencies for their continuous support.\u201d\nFeasibility Study Details\nThe FS was integrated by BBA Inc. under the supervision of Ms. Kim-Quy\u00ean Nguy\u00ean, P.

Each zone is characterized by multiple tabular panels, which mainly trend ENE and dip vertically to sub-vertically.\nThe planned underground mine will have a targeted production rate of 3,400 tonnes per day (\u201ctpd\u201d). The selected mining method is longitudinal longhole open stoping. Stope dimensions are 20 metres in height, median of 25 metres in strike length, and have a median thickness of 4.4 metres with a minimum thickness of 3.0 metres. Mineralized material will be extracted using a fleet of 14 and 18 tonne load-haul-dumps (\u201cLHDs\u201d) and 54 tonne haul trucks using a ramp to surface.\nProcessing\nA total of 3,400 tpd run-of-mine will be processed at the Windfall site. The process plant consists of primary crushing, followed by a grinding circuit consisting of a SAG mill (24\u2019 x 11\u2019, in closed circuit with a pebble crusher) and ball mill (17\u2019 x 31\u2019, in closed circuit with cyclones - SABC circuit). A gravity circuit followed by leaching recovers coarse gold from the cyclone underflow, while the cyclone overflow, at a P80= 37 microns, is treated in a carbon-in\u2013pulp (\u201cCIP\u201d) circuit, followed by SO2/air cyanide destruction. Gold and silver are recovered in an adsorption-desorption-recovery (\u201cADR\") circuit and electrowinning (\u2018\u2019EW\u2019\u2019) cells, with gold room recovery and production of dor\u00e9 bars.\nThe process plant is followed by a tailings filtration plant with filter press to produce paste backfill to send underground and/or dry material for filtered tailings stack storage.\nThe process plant is estimated to average 93.1% payable gold recovery and 83.3% for silver over the LOM.\nThe process plant building also includes mine and mill offices, a dry, warehouse, and first aid office.\nSurface Infrastructure and Indirects\nThe mine envisions using existing exploration camp surface infrastructure: site access road; underground exploration ramp portal; underground ventilation and services; waste rock stockpile; ponds; water treatment plant; power line and substation; telecommunication tower; storage domes; and diesel generators. The project will include the construction of the following infrastructure: camp complex; First Nations cultural centre; potable water and sewage systems; gatehouse; truck shop; core shack; process plant complex including crushing line, offices, dry and warehouse; waste rock stockpile extension; overburden and ore stockpiles; tailings filtration and paste backfill plant; fire protection system; water treatment plant upgrade; surface water management facility including ditches, ponds and pumping stations; overhead power lines; service and hauling roads; Lynx portal and services; exhaust ventilation systems; fuel storage and distribution; and tailings storage facility.\nIndirect costs such as owner\u2019s costs, and construction management, temporary facilities for construction and other related items are estimated at C$237 million. An additional C$49.5 million has been budgeted as contingency for specific direct and indirect costs.\nEnvironment and Closure\nThe Windfall mining project is located north of the 49th parallel in the administrative region of Nord-du-Qu\u00e9bec, on Category III lands of the Eeyou Istchee Baie-James territory. The mine site is located approximately 270 kilometres from the city of Val-d\u2019Or and 115 kilometres east of the town of Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon.\nThe project is subject to the provincial EIA and review procedure under Section 153 of chapter II of the Environment Quality Act (Qu\u00e9bec) (LQE; L.R.Q., c. Q 2 ), which documents the provisions applicable to the James Bay and Northern Qu\u00e9bec region, in connection with the agreement of the same name.\nInventories have been carried out since 2010. Additional data is being collected and the results will be integrated into the ongoing EIA study.\nIn addition to provincial EIA approval, the project will require permits and authorizations prior to construction and operation of the proposed mine. Requests for these approvals will be submitted following the EIA.\nA closure plan for the Windfall project has been developed, the closure costs are estimated at C$83.3 million (excluding salvage value). The objective of site closure is to return the site to a fully satisfactory state that includes eliminating all unacceptable health hazards and ensuring public safety, eliminating the production and spread of contaminants that could damage the receiving environment and, in the long term (aiming to cease the necessity of maintenance and monitoring) returning the site to an environmentally sound condition. This cost estimate includes site restoration as well as post-closure monitoring, 10% of direct costs for engineering and a contingency of 18%. In accordance with Qu\u00e9bec mining legislation, the Corporation will post a bond as a guarantee for 100% of the anticipated site closure costs.\nStakeholder Engagement\nThe Windfall project is located on the traditional lands of the CFNW. Osisko has taken a proactive approach toward stakeholder consultation, holding more than 250 communication activities since 2015, primarily with in CFNW and Lebel-sur-Qu\u00e9villon. Consultation on the project with First Nation and non-First Nation communities was initiated in 2015 and has continued with frequent updates on project activities, meetings, open house presentations, committees and employment and contracting opportunities.\nConcerns raised by communities include land disturbance, water quality, impacts to wildlife and the cumulative effects of all projects in the area. Osisko is committed to continuing the dialogue with potentially affected communities through the environmental assessment process.\nThe CFNW and non-First Nation communities have expressed strong support for the project. Osisko\u2019s understanding of their main interest in the project is the maximization of local economic benefits - specifically with a focus on employment and entrepreneurial opportunities throughout the various phases of the project. In 2022 more than 95 First Nations community members worked at the Windfall site. Since 2016, Osisko has invested over C$256 million dollars in the purchase of goods and services from First Nations-owned companies or joint ventures.\nRoyalties\nA 2.1% NSR royalty on all metals produced from the Windfall project has been applied in the FS based on existing royalty agreements and reflecting the mine plan.\nOpportunities\nThe FS mining plan includes 1.3 million tonnes of inferred mineral resources located within mineral reserve blocks, for which a zero-grade value has been assigned. Through a limited amount of underground drilling, the Corporation believes that it could potentially convert most of the 1.3 million tonnes, grading between 4.0-6.0 g/t Au and representing between 160,000 - 250,000 ounces Au of inferred resource material.\nBased on bulk sample results from Windfall, the Corporation believes additional recovery could be achieved by optimizing gravity circuit.\nOngoing studies and continuous improvement in waste and water management approaches may result in the reduction of the surface footprint and impacts.\nThe Corporation will continue to investigate opportunities that may arise to allow electrification of the mining fleet as a way of further reduction of the project carbon footprint.\n| Conference Call |\nNotes for Mineral Resource Estimate (being the Windfall MRE (2022)) on Windfall Deposit\n|\n| (1 | ) | The effective date of the Windfall MRE (2022) is June 7, 2022. The Windfall MRE (2022) was prepared by Pierre-Luc Richard, P. Geo. (OGQ#1119) and Mathieu B\u00e9lisle, P. Eng. of BBA Inc., each of whom is a \"qualified person\" within the meaning of NI 43-101 and considered to be \"independent\" of Osisko under Section 1.5 of NI 43-101. | ||\n|\n| (2 | ) | The Windfall MRE (2022) has been prepared in accordance with the \"Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines\", adopted by the CIM Council on November 29, 2019. | ||\n|\n| (3 | ) | The mineral resources referred to in the Windfall MRE (2022) are not mineral reserves and they do not have demonstrated economic viability. The quantity and grade of reported inferred mineral resources are uncertain in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to define these inferred mineral resources as indicated mineral resources or measured mineral resources; however, it is reasonably expected that most of the inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to indicated mineral resources with continued exploration. Resources are presented undiluted and in situ and are considered to have reasonable prospects for economic extraction. Isolated and discontinuous blocks above the stated cut-off grade are excluded from the mineral resource estimate. Must-take material (i.e., isolated blocks below cut-off grade located within a potentially mineable volume) was included in the mineral resource estimate. | ||\n|\n| (4 | ) | Mineral resources are reported inclusive of those mineral resources converted to mineral reserves. | ||\n|\n| (5 | ) | As of June 7, 2022, being the effective date of the Windfall MRE (2022), the drill database comprises a total of 4,834 drill holes for 1,852,861 metres of drilling in the area extent of the mineral resource estimate, of which 4,152 drill holes (1,665,282 metres) were completed and assayed by Osisko. The drill hole grid spacing is approximately 12.5 metres x 12.5 metres for definition drilling, 25 metres x 25 metres for infill drilling and larger for extension drilling. | ||\n|\n| (6 | ) | All core assays reported by Osisko were obtained by analytical methods described below under \"Technical Information and Quality Control & Quality Assurance \u2013 Quality Control and Reporting Protocols\". | ||\n|\n| (7 | ) | Geological interpretation of the deposit is based on lithologies, mineralization style, alteration, and structural features. Most mineralization envelopes are subvertical, striking NE-SW and plunging approximately 40 degrees towards the North-East. The 3D wireframing was generated in Leapfrog Geo, a modelling software, from hand selections of mineralization intervals. The mineral resource estimate includes a total of 579 tabular, mostly sub-vertical domains defined by individual wireframes with a minimum true thickness of 2.0 metres. | ||\n|\n| (8 | ) | Assays were composited within the mineralization domains into 2.0 metre length composites. A value of 0.00125 g/t Au and 0.0025 g/t Ag (\u00bc of the detection limit) was applied to unassayed core intervals. | ||\n|\n| (9 | ) | High-grade composites were capped. Capping was determined in each zone from statistical studies on groups of lenses sharing similar mineralization characteristics. Capping varies from 6 g/t Au to 200 g/t Au and from 5 g/t Ag to 150 g/t Ag. A three-pass capping strategy defined by capping values decreasing as interpolation search distances increase was used in the grade estimations. | ||\n|\n| (10 | ) | Block models were produced using Datamine\u2122 Studio RM Software. The models are defined by parent cell sizes of 5 metres EW, 2 metres NS and 5 metres height, and sub-blocked to minimum sub-cell sizes of 1.25 metres EW, 0.5 metres NS and 1.25 metres height. | ||\n|\n| (11 | ) | Ordinary Kriging (OK) based interpolations were produced for gold estimations in each zone of the Windfall deposit, while silver grade estimations were produced using Inverse Distance Squared (ID2) interpolations. Gold estimation parameters are based on composite variography analyses. The gold estimation parameters were used for the silver estimation. | ||\n|\n| (12 | ) | Density values between 2.74 and 2.93 were applied to the mineralized lenses. | ||\n|\n| (13 | ) | The mineral resource estimate included in the Windfall MRE (2022) uses the measured mineral resource, indicated mineral resource and inferred mineral resource categories, as follows: | ||\n|\n|\n| (a) | The measured mineral resource category is manually defined and encloses areas where: | ||\n|\n|\n|\n| (i) | drill spacing is less than 12.5 metres; | |\n|\n|\n|\n| (ii) | blocks are informed by mostly four drill holes; | |\n|\n|\n|\n| (iii) | geological evidence is sufficient to confirm geological and grade continuity; and | |\n|\n|\n|\n| (iv) | lenses have generally been accessed by underground workings. | |\n|\n|\n| (b) | The indicated mineral resource category is manually defined and encloses areas where: | ||\n|\n|\n|\n| (i) | drill spacing is generally less than 25 metres; | |\n|\n|\n|\n| (ii) | blocks are informed by mostly three drill holes; and | |\n|\n|\n|\n| (iii) | geological evidence is sufficient to assume geological and grade continuity. | |\n|\n|\n| (c) | The inferred mineral resource category is manually defined and encloses areas where: | ||\n|\n|\n|\n| (i) | drill spacing is less than 100 metres; | |\n|\n|\n|\n| (ii) | blocks are informed by a minimum of two drill holes; | |\n|\n|\n|\n| (iii) | geological evidence is sufficient to imply, but not verify geological and grade continuity. | |\n|\n| (14 | ) | Tonnage and gold grade of the stockpiles were estimated using the grade control model. Densities by lithologies, ranging from 2.76 to 2.84, were used in the estimation of the tonnages. Gold grades were estimated with an average of muck samples results for every round tonnage, based on muck samples with an average sample weight of 3.4 kilograms taken every 8-yard scoop bucket. The sampling capping varying between 60 g/t Au to 80 g/t Au was applied on the muck gold grade results. An average per silver grade estimates in the stockpiles was reported from the resource block model as silver was not analyzed in the muck samples. | ||\n|\n| (15 | ) | The mineral resource is reported at 3.5 g/t Au cut-off. The cut-off grade is based on the following economic parameters: gold price at US$1,600/oz, exchange rate at US$1.28 = C$1.00, 93% mill recovery; payability of 99.95%; selling cost at US$5/oz, 2% NSR royalties, mining cost at C$125/t milled, G&A cost at C$39/t milled, processing cost at C$42/t, and environment cost at C$4/t. | ||\n|\n| (16 | ) | Estimates use metric units (metres (m), tonnes (t), and g/t). Metal contents are presented in troy ounces (metric tonne x grade / 31.103475). | ||\n|\n| (17 | ) | The independent qualified person is not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title-related, taxation, socio-political or marketing issues, or any other relevant issue that could materially affect the mineral resource estimate. |\nTechnical Information and Quality Control & Quality Assurance\nIndependent Qualified Persons\nThis FS was prepared for Osisko by BBA Inc. and other industry consultants, each of whom is a \"qualified person\" within the meaning of NI 43-101 and considered to be \"independent\" of Osisko under Section 1.5 of NI 43-101, including the following:\n-\nPatrick Andrieux, P.Eng.

Mineral Resources Estimates follow the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (\"CIM\") definitions standards for mineral resources and have been completed in accordance with the Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects as defined by National Instrument 43-101. Reported tonnage and grade figures have been rounded from raw estimates to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimate. Minor variations may occur during the addition of rounded numbers. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Resources were constrained by MII Pit Shell and based on a cut-off grade of 0.5 g/t Au and $1,500/oz gold price. Details for the Updated Resource are provided in the Technical Notes section of this press release. For details regarding the 31 December 2021 resources, please consult the press release dated [date] of Endeavour.\nIn addition to the delineated resources, drilling conducted during the year also confirmed mineralisation at extensions of several known orebodies and at new targets, which will form the basis for the 2023 drilling programme with the goal of delineating further resources.\nSebastien de Montessus, President and CEO, said: \u201cWe are very proud of our achievements at Ity following its successful build in 2019. The mine now ranks amongst the highest quality operations within West Africa due to its low-cost production profile and long mine life. This status has been underpinned by our significant exploration success at Ity, which has led to a more than doubling of the resource base since its feasibility study was published in 2016, coupled with a strong operating performance.\nWe are very pleased to demonstrate that now all three of our flagship assets, Sabodala-Massawa, Hound\u00e9 and Ity, boast M&I resources above 5 million ounces each, with exploration remaining an integral part of our capital allocation strategy as it underpins our ability to maintain long mine lives and continually optimise our portfolio. Looking ahead, we continue to see significant exploration potential at Ity as we remain on track to achieve our objective of discovering between 3.5 to 4.5Moz of Indicated resources over the 2021-2025 period, with nearly 2.0Moz discovered already. At a group level, we are pleased to also be on track to discovering between 15 to 20Moz of Indicated resources over the same period.\nOn the operational front, Ity continues to perform well as it is on track to beat its full-year production guidance of 255\u2014270koz and its AISC guidance of $850\u2014900 per ounce.\u201d\nPatrick Bouisset, Executive Vice President Exploration and Growth said: \u201cToday\u2019s resource additions are the culmination of several years of exploration efforts which we are extremely proud of. We first discovered the Bakatouo deposit in late 2016, which was soon followed by exploration successes at the Walter and Ity Flat deposits and the West Flotouo discovery. Today, we have successfully proven that all seven of the previously thought independent deposits located around the Ity intrusive are in fact a continuous mineralised system. In addition to the resource delineated, the benefit of this discovery is the creation of a unique resource model which is expected to greatly improve our mine planning capabilities.\nFollowing the work this year to prove mineralised continuity of known orebodies and to identify mineralisation at new targets, we believe that we are well-positioned for continued success in 2023 as we look to delineate further resources. In addition to discoveries made in both the near-mill area and in the Le Plaque area, we are very excited about the discovery made at Gbampleu where several high-grade and thick lenses of mineralisation were identified.\u201d\nITY MINE 2022 EXPLORATION PROGRAM\nIn recent years, exploration efforts have focused on the PE26 mining permit (which hosts the processing plant and several deposits including Walter, Bakatouo, West Flotouo, Ity-Flat, Verse Est, and Zia NE), on PE49 mining permit (which hosts the Daapleu and Gbeitouo deposits) and on the PE53 mining permit (which hosts the Le Plaque and Yopleu-Legaleu deposits and other targets including Delta South East).\nSince the beginning of the year, a total of 51,181 meters of drilling was completed at Ity, mainly within a 20km radius from the plant, as shown in Figures 1 and 2 below. The exploration programme mostly focused on extending resources at several near mine deposits including Walter-Bakatouo, West Flotouo, Delta Extension at Le Plaque and Yopleu-Legaleu, delineating potential deposit extensions at Colline Sud, and on assessing the potential of new greenfield targets including Gbampleu, and Delta South East.\n| Figure 1: Endeavour Controlled 120km Ity Mine Corridor | Figure 2: Ity Near Mill Map |\nAs detailed in Table 2 below, a total of 753koz of M&I resources were delineated since the beginning of the year, with the additions coming from West Flotouo, Yopleu-Legaleu, Ity-Ity Flat, Verse Est, and Walter.\nTable 2: Ity Resource Additions\n|\n| PREVIOUS RESOURCE |\n| UPDATED RESOURCE |\n| VARIANCE | ||||\n| On a 100% basis.

Details for the Updated Resource are provided in the Technical Notes section of this press release. For details regarding the 31 December 2021 resources, please consult the press release dated [date] of Endeavour.\nNEAR MILL EXPLORATION EFFORTS\nThe resource model 3D views, in Figures 3 and 4 below, illustrate the exploration success and improved understanding achieved in the near-mill area between 2017 (when plant construction was launched) and today. A maiden resource for the Bakatouo deposit was delineated in 2016 and since then several new deposits and extensions have been discovered, including Bakatouo extension, West Flotouo, Walter and Ity-Ity Flat. The area, which spans 7km long by 3km wide, today hosts 2.8Moz at 1.81g/t Au.\nThe drilling efforts conducted in 2022 successfully demonstrated that all 7 of the previously thought independent deposits located around the Ity intrusive are in fact a continuous mineralised system. This finding has resulted in the creation of a single resource model for the area which is expected to greatly improve mine planning capabilities.\nFigure 3: 2017 Grand Ity Resource Model (3D View Looking North)\nFigure 4: 2022 Grand Ity Resource Model (3D View Looking North)\nAs shown in Figure 5 below, lithologies in the Ity area comprise a series of lower Proterozoic (Birimian) volcanosediments and carbonate lenses intruded by a granodiorite. Skarn formations have been developed in the carbonate-bearing units in the vicinity of the intrusion. The different Ity area deposits are distributed all around the intrusion, in both meta-volcanosediments (West Flotouo, Flotouo Extension, Verse East) and skarns formations (Ity, Zia NE, Walter, Bakatouo). Gold mineralisation occurred during a late Birimian orogenic hydrothermal event, within transpressive shear zones that developed at the margin of the intrusion.\nThe geological contexts of the Le Plaque and Daapleu deposits differ from that of Ity; in the Le Plaque area, gold mineralisation is essentially hosted in granodiorite, which was itself intruded by several generations of diorite; at Daapleu, gold mineralisation occurred at the contact between meta-volcanosediments and a rhyolitic intrusion (different from granodiorite) locally named Daaplite.\nFigure 5: West Flotouo map\nJunction between West Flotouo and Flotouo Extension (\u201cWest Flotouo\u201d)\n-\nFollowing promising initial results from the 2021 campaign, 76 additional holes amounting to 16,779 meters were drilled in 2022 to increase the resources and to delineate the northeast mineralisation extension in the area called Flotouo Extension.\n-\nThe West Flotouo/Flotouo Extension deposit is now the Ity mine\u2019s largest deposit and the mineralisation remains open along strike and at depth.\n-\nAs shown in Figures 6 and 7 below, the general gold mineralisation of the West Flotouo/Flotouo Extension is overall northeast-southwest trending, moderately dipping to the northwest and has been identified over a 1km strike length. Host rocks comprise sheared clastic sediments in the southern part and skarns in the northern part of the deposit.\n-\nThe West Flotouo/Flotouo Extension deposit will be integrated into the mine plan as soon as possible given it is an attractive discovery due to its high grade and very close proximity to the plant.\nFigure 6: West Flotouo cross-section\nFigure 7: West Flotouo cross-section\nJunction between Walter \u2013 Bakatouo deposit\n-\nA total of 51 holes amounting to 9,037 meters were drilled in 2022 to convert the Inferred resources to Indicated status and increase the resources at the junction between the Walter and Bakatouo skarn hosted gold deposits.\n-\nAs shown in Figure 8 below, the 2022 drill results have returned significant intercepts with large thicknesses and high grades which confirmed the continuity of the deposit.\n-\nBest selected intercepts include:\n-\nHole WA22-119: 5 meters at 2.48g/t Au from 200m and 7 meters at 34.96 g/t Au from 207 meters\n-\nHole WA22-134: 14 meters at 5.95g/t Au from 35 meters\n-\n-\nThe mineralised lenses are still open at depth and along strike.\nFigure 8: Walter \u2013 Bakatouo cross-section\nJunction between Bakatouo Northwest - Zia Northest deposits\n-\nA total of 8 holes amounting to 1,008 meters were drilled in 2022 at the junction between the Zia Northeast and Bakatouo deposits. The purpose was to confirm the continuity of the mineralisation in this zone which is located in proximity to the Ity plant.\n-\nAs shown in Figure 9 below, the 2022 drill results returned significant shallow mineralised intercepts, with best selected intercepts including:\n-\nHole BK22-337: 14 meters at 1.99g/t Au from 43.3 meters\n-\nHole BK22-332: 10 meters at 1.24g/t from 26 meters\n-\n-\nThe resource additions will be quickly converted into reserves and prioritised in the mine plan given the shallow nature of the orebody and its proximity to the plant.\nFigure 9: Bakatouo Northwest - Zia Northest cross-section\nVerse Est deposit\n-\nA total of 16 holes amounting to 1,638 meters were drilled in 2022 at Verse Est. The purpose was to follow-up on the positive drilling results from the prior years\u2019 campaign, that identified the 500-meter long, shallow lying, mineralised system, which is located in close proximity to the Ity plant, adjacent to a former mining waste area on the Eastern side of the Mont Ity pit.\n-\nAs shown in Figure 10 below, the 2022 drill results confirmed the continuity of the mineralisation with significant shallow-lying intercepts with best selected intercepts including:\n-\nHole VE22-105: 11 meters at 4.17g/t Au from the surface\n-\nHole VE22-103: 7 meters at 1.69g/t Au from 37 meters\n-\n-\nThe resource additions will be quickly converted into reserves and prioritised in the mine plan given the shallow nature of the orebody and its proximity to the plant.\nFigure 10: Verse Est cross-section\nLE PLAQUE AREA EXPLORATION EFFORTS\nYopleu-Legaleu deposit\n-\nThe Yopleu-Legaleu deposit is located 1km southeast of the previously discovered Le Plaque deposit, where mining activities began in late 2021, and less than 10km away from the Ity plant.\n-\nA maiden Inferred resource was delineated in 2021 while further drilling in 2022, comprised of 85 holes amounting to 10,918 meters, led to the conversion of the Inferred resource into Indicated resource status and further resource delineation.\n-\nThe 2022 infill drilling results confirmed the continuity of the mineralisation within the 2021 Inferred resources pit shell and defined significantly enhanced mineralisation potential with the discovery of additional mineralised intervals including higher grade intervals encountered both at depth and laterally. Some of the best selected intercepts include:\n-\nHole FL22-1746: 24 meters at 3.96g/t Au from 125 meters\n-\nHole FL22-1765: 23 meters at 2.63g/t Au from 49 meters\n-\n-\nThe 2022 step-out drill results also confirmed that mineralisation extends 200 meters along strike to the northeast and 450 meters to the southwest, with high grade thick intercepts such as:\n-\nHole FL22-1689: 14.0 meters at 2.49g/t Au from 81 meters and 9.0 at 6.83 g/t Au from 160 meters\n-\nDelta Extension at Le Plaque deposit\n-\nThe Delta Extension deposit was delineated along a sub-parallel south-eastern extension of the previously discovered Le Plaque deposit, where mining activities began in late 2021, and is located less than 10km away from the Ity mill. A total of 5 holes amounting to 635 meters were drilled in 2022.\n-\nAs shown in Figure 11 below, the drill results confirmed the continuity, at shallow depth, of the Delta Extension mineralised vein system, toward the southeast underneath the 2021 pit shell.\n-\nBest selected intercepts include:\n-\nHole FL22-1675: 9 meters at 2.22g/t Au from 67 meters\n-\nHole FL22-1675: 5 meters at 2.58g/t Au from 97 meters\n-\nFigure 11: Delta Extension cross-section\nDelta Sud-Est new discovery\n-\nThe newly discovered Delta Sud-Est target covers a 1km by 700 meter area, located 1km southwest and 300 meters Sout East from the Yopleu-Legaleu and Delta deposits.\n-\nThis area had been preliminarily outlined in 2020 with an initial Air Core (\u201cAC\u201d) drilling and in 2021 with 1 RC hole amounting to 152 meters and 4 DD holes amounting to 712 meters with initial positive results. This year, a more systematic drilling campaign with 28 RC holes drilled amounting to 2,753 meters was focussed on Delta Sud-Est.\n-\nThe 2022 drill results confirmed the presence of several parallel mineralised veins within granodiorite that seem to be on a trend and possibly continuous with the Yopleu-Legaleu vein system.\n-\nBest selected intercepts including:\n-\nHole FL22-1710: 7 meters at 3.08g/t Au from 77 meters\n-\nHole FL22-1723: 3 meters at 10.57g/t Au from 59 meters\n-\n-\nThese results confirm the potential of the Delta Sud-Est target and as such a follow-up drilling program is planned for 2023.\nOTHER NEAR-MILL DEPOSITS\nColline Sud deposit\n-\nThe Colline Sud deposit is located 1 km southwest of the historical Mont Ity deposit, and approximately 5km away from the processing plant.\n-\nFollowing the results of former exploration AC and grade control drilling programmes, a further 34 holes amounting to 3,544 meters were drilled in 2022.\n-\nThe 2022 drill results confirmed the along strike extension of the gold mineralisation over 300 meters to the northeast, in addition to identifying a 300 meter long parallel trend immediately to the southwest, with best selected intercepts including:\n-\nHole CS22-177: 4 meters at 6.30g/t Au from 77 meters, including 1 meter at 14.75 g/t Au from 79 meters, and 8.0 meters at 8.98 g/t Au from 84, including 1 meter at 25.30 g/t Au from 87 meters, and including 1 meter at 13.80 g/t Au from 89 meters, and including 1 meter at 20 g/t Au from 91 meters\n-\nHole CS22-187: 9 meters at 1.39 g/t Au from 16 meters and 5 meters at 1.41 g/t Au from 32 meters\n-\nDaapleu deposit\n-\nThe Daapleu deposit is located approximately 5km from the processing plant.\n-\nA total of 60 shallow depth holes amounting to 4,407 meters were drilled in 2022 with a new mineralised vein system intercepted along the continuity of the Daapleu deposit, over 350 meters to the northeast. Best selected intercepts include:\n-\nHole DA22-644: 2 meters at 1.00g/t Au from 25 meters and 7 meters at 5.16g/t Au from 41 meters including 1.0 meter at 12.70g/t Au\n-\nHole DA22-645: 7 meters at 1.30g/t Au from 90 meters and 4 meters at 1.20g/t Au from 106 meters\n-\n-\nThese results will be included in the next resource update and will be followed up with the 2023 drilling campaign.\nGBAMPLEU NEW DISCOVERY\n-\nAs shown in Figure 1 above, the Gbampleu discovery is located in the Toulepleu exploration permit (PR462), located 22km south of the Ity plant. Gbampleu sits in the central part of the Toulepleu-Ity greenstone belt, on the southern border of the Guiamapleu granodioritic mole.\n-\nGbampleu was ranked as a highly prospective target based on a historic gold-in-soil survey which highlighted a north-south striking, 1.3 km x 0.6km, anomaly (with >100ppb Au), which overlays steeply dipping, southwest-northeast oriented, Birimian rocks composed of meta-volcanic formations (dominantly mafic) and a set of gneissic rocks of more felsic composition (Zeitouo gneiss).\n-\nA first RC drilling program, totalling 50 holes amounting to 4,920 meters was completed in 2021. Following the promising results of this campaign, a combined RC-DD program comprising 17 holes amounting to 3,212 meters have been drilled so far this year, to define the controlling factors of the mineralisation and to delineate the deposit over 450 meters along strike, where drill results have confirmed high grade mineralisation. Drilling is ongoing with the along strike extension remaining to be tested.\n-\nBest selected intercepts include:\n-\nHole GP22-051: 43.25 meters at 11.32 g/t Au from 175.8 meters, including 4.3 meters at 29.81 g/t Au from 178.75 meters, including 3 meters at 61.68 g/t Au from 185 meters, including 2 meters at 31.18 g/t Au from 193 meters and including 2 meters at 10.95 g/t Au from 206 meters\n-\n-\nAs shown in Figures 12 and 13 below, high gold grades (notably with visible gold) have been intercepted in highly silicified zones within Biotite Gneiss characterized by penetrative silicification and abundant quartz pods or strongly deformed quartz-filled veins and breccia. Some of these veins are also filled with chlorite and sulphides (pyrite, sphalerite).\nFigure 12: Gbampleu map\nFigure 13: Gbampleu cross-section\nAll intercepts reported above are apparent thickness.\nTECHNICAL NOTES\nIty Area Resource Modelling\nThe statistical analysis, geological modelling and resource estimation were prepared by the Endeavour resource team, under the direction of Kevin Harris (CPG) VP Resources for Endeavour as the Qualified Person as defined by NI 43-101.\nThe Grand Ity resource update is based upon updated drilling data and interpretations. The Ity Mineral Resource model was developed in Seequent\u2019s Leapfrog Geo and Geovia\u2019s Surpac modelling software. The database used to generate the Mineral Resources comprised some 2,112 drill holes, with a total of 264,788 meters drilled. The updated model is based upon 152 new drill holes totalling 29,034 meters. The drilling data are supported by industry standard quality assurance and quality control systems, with quality control sampling comprising blanks, coarse blanks, certified reference materials, and field and pulp duplicates. The Resource team has reviewed the QAQC data and are confident they are of high standard to be used in resource estimation.\n146 mineralisation domains were modelled using geology and grade continuity, by selecting intervals which forms part of each mineralisation lenses; a nominal cut-off of 0.5g/t Au. The Grand Ity deposit was divided into 7 resource areas named: Bakatouo NW, West Flotouo, Verse Est, Walter, Bakatouo, Ity-Ity Flat and ZiaNE. The gold assays from the drill holes were composited to 1.0 meter intervals within the modelled zone. Capping varied depending on the mineralised domain, between no cap and 45g/t Au.\nDensity measurements from 4,929 samples and covering each of the material types and major lithology were averaged based on the material type. Average density values were applied to the associated portions of the block model as outlined below:\n-\nLaterite/Overburden: 1.80 g/cm3\n-\nSaprolite: 1.50 g/cm3\n-\nSaprock: 2.50 g/cm3\n-\nFresh: 2.90 g/cm3\nGold grades were estimated using Ordinary Kriging for most of the mineralised domains. Where it was not possible to define a well-structured variogram for the smallest domains with low sample support, an Inverse Distance Squared (\u201cIDW2\u201d) estimator was used. The grade was in multiple passes to define the higher confidence areas and extend the grade to the interpreted mineralised zone extents.\nThe grade estimation was validated with visual and statistical analysis and comparison with the drilling data on sections with swath plots comparing the block grades with the composites.\nThe quality and spatial distribution of the data used and the geological continuity of the mineralisation and the quality of the estimated block model for Grand Ity is sufficient for the reporting of Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources. Indicated Mineral Resources have typically been defined in areas within a search range of 40-45 meters, where there is a reasonable level of confidence in geological and grade continuity. Inferred Mineral Resources have typically been defined in areas outside the first pass estimation range of 40-45 meters and where the continuity and confidence is reduced.\nMineral Resources are reported within a Whittle optimised pit shell using cut-off of grades of 0.5 g/t Au. Optimisation parameters used are as below:\n-\nMining cost: $2.66 - $3.66/t Oxide; $3.43 - $4.27/t Transition; $3.70 - $4.39/t Fresh\n-\nProcessing cost + G&A + Ore cost: Oxide: $16.56 - $20.67/t; Transition $16.81 - 30.05/t; Fresh: $16.92 - $20.80/t\n-\nSelling cost: $9.15/oz Au Transportation and Refining; Royalty of 3.5%\n-\nMining recovery: 95%\n-\nMining dilution: 0%\n-\nProcessing recovery: Oxide 80.2 - 93.6%; Transition 85.2 - 96.2%; Fresh 84.7 - 96.2%\n-\nAverage slope angles: Oxide 33\u00b0; Transition 33\u00b0; Fresh 42.3\u00b0- 58.4\u00b0\nYopleu-Legaleu Resource Modelling\nThe statistical analysis, geological modelling and resource estimation were prepared by the Endeavour resource team, under the direction of Kevin Harris (CPG) VP Resources for Endeavour as the Qualified Person as defined by NI 43-101.\nThe Yopleu-Legaleu resource update are based upon updated drilling data and interpretations as of October 2022. The Yopleu-Legaleu Mineral Resource model was developed in Seequent\u2019s Leapfrog Geo and Geovia\u2019s Surpac modelling software. The database used to generate the Mineral Resources comprised 357 drillholes, with a total of drilling meters of 29,071 meters. The updated model is based upon 85 new drillholes totalling 10,918 meters. The drilling data are supported by industry standard quality assurance and quality control systems, with quality control sampling comprising blanks, coarse blanks, certified reference materials, and field and pulp duplicates. Resource team has reviewed the QAQC data and are confident they are of high standard to be used in resource estimation.\nSixteen mineralisation domains were modelled using geology and grade continuity, by selecting intervals which forms part of each mineralisation lenses; a nominal cut-off of 0.4g/t Au. The gold assays from the drill holes were composited to 1.0 meter intervals within the modelled zone. Capping varied depending on the mineralised domain, between no cap and 10g/t Au.\nDensity measurements from 294 samples and covering each of the material types and major lithology were averaged based on the material type. Average density values were applied to the associated portions of the block model as outlined below:\n-\nLaterite/Overburden: 1.70 g/cm3\n-\nSaprolite: 1.58 g/cm3\n-\nSaprock: 2.36 g/cm3\n-\nFresh: 2.71 g/cm3\nGold grades were estimated using Inverse Distance Squared and Ordinary Kriging for all of the mineralised domains. Generally, it was not possible to define a well-structured variogram models for most of the domains. The two methods produced similar results so the Inverse Distance Squared method was chosen. The grade was in multiple passes to define the higher confidence areas and extend the grade to the interpreted mineralised zone extents.\nThe grade estimation was validated with visual and statistical analysis and comparison with the drilling data on sections with swath plots comparing the block grades with the composites.\nThe quality and spatial distribution of the data used and the geological continuity of the mineralisation and the quality of the estimated block model for Yopleu-Legaleu is sufficient for the reporting of Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources. Indicated Mineral Resources have typically been defined in areas within a search range of 40 m, where there is a reasonable level of confidence in geological and grade continuity. Inferred Mineral Resources have typically been defined in areas outside the first pass estimation range of 40 meters and where the continuity and confidence is reduced.\nMineral Resources are reported within a Whittle optimised pit shell using cut-off of grades of 0.5 g/t Au. Optimisation parameters used are as below:\n-\nMining cost: $2.80/t Oxide; $3.50/t Transition; $3.69/t Fresh\n-\nProcessing cost + G&A + Ore cost: Oxide: $21.85/t; Transition $21.85/t; Fresh: $21.92/t\n-\nSelling cost: $70/oz Au gold\n-\nMining recovery: 95%\n-\nMining dilution: 0%\n-\nProcessing recovery: Oxide 95%; Transition 93%; Fresh 88%\n-\nAverage slope angles: 40\u00b0\nDrilling, Assay, Quality Assurance / Quality Control Procedures\nReverse Circulation (\u201cRC\u201d) and Air Core (\u201cAC\u201d) drilling delivers material to the surface via percussion hammer pushing pulverized rock into dual tube rods which evacuate the material to the surface via high pressure compressed air. The samples are collected from the cyclone at surface at 1-meter intervals. The cyclone is cleaned after every 6-meter rod by flushing the hole. Additional manual cleaning is required in saprolitic or wet ground, closely monitored by the site geologist / geotechnician to ensure no sample to sample contamination occurs.\nSamples are split at the drill site using several different riffle splitters, based on bulk sample weight. 2-5kg laboratory and a second 2-5kg reference sample are collected. Bulk and laboratory sample weights, in addition to moisture levels are recorded. Representative samples for each interval were collected with a spear, sieved into chip trays and retained for reference.\nDrill core (PQ, HQ and NQ size) samples are selected by Endeavour geologists and sawn in half with a diamond blade at the project site. Half of the core is retained at the site for reference purposes. Sample intervals are generally 1 meter in length.\nAll samples are transported to the ALS preparation laboratory at the Exploration office site at the Ity Mine. Each laboratory sample is secured in poly-woven bags ensuring that there is a clear record of the chain of custody. On arrival samples are weighed. Complete samples are crushed to 2mm (70% passing) with 1 kg split out for pulverization. The entire 1 kg is pulverized 75\u03bcm (85% passing). A 250 gram final pulp sample is prepared. These 250 gram pulps are packaged in cardboard boxes and shipped to ALS Ouagadougou. At ALS Ouagadougou a 50 gram pulp sample is extracted from the final 25 gram pulp and analysed for gold (Au) using standard fire assay techniques. An Atomic Absorption (\u201cAA\u201d) finish provides the final Au value.\nBlanks, field duplicates and certified reference material (\u201cCRM\u2019s\u201d) are inserted into the sample sequence by Endeavour geologists at a rate of 1 of each samples type per 20 samples. This ensures that there is a 5% Quality Assurance / Quality Control (\u201cQA/QC\u201d) sample insertion rate applied to each fire assay batch. The sampling and assaying are monitored through analysis of these QA/QC samples. This QA/QC program was audited by a consultant, independent from Endeavour Mining and has been verified to follow industry best practices.\nIn February 2022, 1,017 samples from the 2021 drilling program were sent to ALS Ouagadougou for umpire (referee) analysis. Comparison of the Original analysis against the umpire analysis revealed a moderate Correlation Coefficient of 72% for all samples. When the Au data was capped at 20 ppm the Correlation Coefficient increased to a strong 92.8 %. It is not unusual for very high grade samples to show highly variable results even when the same samples are analysed at the same lab a second time. Endeavour accepts these Umpire assay results from ALS Ouaga and have confidence that the original assays provided by are accurate.\nCore sampling and assay data were monitored through a quality assurance/quality control program designed to follow NI 43-101 and industry best practice.\nFull drill results are available by clicking here.\nQUALIFIED PERSONS\nThe scientific and technical content of this news release has been reviewed, verified and compiled by Silvia Bottero, Professional Natural Scientist, VP Exploration C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire for Endeavour Mining.

Readers should refer to section 15 \u201cNon-GAAP Performance Measures\u201d.\nQ1 FY2023 Production Analysis\nQ1 FY2023 gold production was 2,066oz, a 98% increase as compared to 1,043oz for Q1 FY2022. The increase mainly was from higher feed grade.\nQ1 FY2023 ore processed decreased to 132,447t from 156,611t for Q1 FY2022. The decreased mill feed was mainly due to less oxide ore and old tailings being fed into plant.\nAverage mill feed grade was higher this quarter (1.03g/t Au for Q1FY2023) as compared to the same period last year (0.54g/t Au for Q1 FY2022) due to higher grade ore from Selinsing and Buffalo Reef than Peranggih mineralized materials. The processing recovery rate decreased to 46.2% for Q1FY2023 as compared to 65.0% in Q1 FY2022 was mainly due to the lower gold recovery from Selinsing leachable sulphide ore processed.\nQ1 FY2023 cash cost per ounce increased by 13% to $1,622/oz from $1,430/oz for Q1 FY2022. This increase was primarily due to harder and lower recovery sulphide materials processed offset by a significant increase in the mill feed grade from 0.54g/t Au to 1.03g/t Au.\nQ1 FY2023 Financial Analysis\nQ1 FY2023 gold sales generated revenue was $0.71 million as compared to $2.38 million from Q1 FY2022. Gold sales revenue was derived from the sale of 400oz (Q1 FY2022: 1,423oz) of gold at an average realized gold price of $1,772 per ounce (Q1 FY2022: $1,829 per ounce) and the delivery of nil (Q1 FY2022: 723 oz at $1,525 per ounce gold equivalent) in fulfilling gold prepaid obligations.\nQ1 FY2023 total production costs decreased by 68% to $0.65 million as compared to $2.04 million from Q1 FY2022. Cash cost per ounce increased by 13% to $1,622/oz as compared to $1,430/oz of the same period last year. The increase was attributable to a 29% decrease in the gold recovery from 65.0% to 46.2% but an increase in mill feed grade to 1.03g/t (Q1 FY2022: 0.54g/t) as a result of processing harder leachable sulphide material.\nGross margin for Q1 FY2023 was $0.06 million before operation expenses and non-cash amortization and accretion. That represented an 83% decrease as compared to $0.35 million from Q1 FY2022. The decrease in gross margin was attributable to lower recovery ore processed, much lower volume of gold sold, and increased cash costs.\nNet loss for Q1 FY2023 was $0.29 million, or ($0.00) per share as compared to net loss of $1.27 million or ($0.00) per share from Q1 FY2022. The net loss was mainly caused by lower operating margins.\nCash and cash equivalents balance as at September 30, 2022 was $16.15 million, a decrease of $4.89 million from the balance at June 30, 2022 of $21.04 million. As at September 30, 2022, the Company had positive working capital of $25.71 million as compared to that at June 30, 2022 of $30.33 million.\nDevelopment\nSelinsing Gold Mine\nAt Selinsing, development work included the continuing of the flotation plant construction, mine development, and flotation testwork on stockpiled transition ore samples. Overall, Selinsing Sulphide Project Development was 85% completed as of September 30, 2022 including: project management, project validation, flotation design and engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning. Mine development includes upgrading of tailing storage facilities, pit push backs, river diversion, and pre-stripping.\nThe flotation plant detail engineering design work has been completed and shop detailing design of earthing and lightning conductor work for power supply upgrade is underway. Procurement of all major and long lead equipment has been completed, with the delivery of the fabricated concentrate filter press arriving in mid-November, after the end of the quarter.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the plant construction work has been largely completed with completion of foundation work at flotation area, reagents area, concentrate thickener area and pipe rack. Other foundation work at filter press building, water recovery thickener and flocculants plant area were completed. After the delivery of concentrate filter press, assembly work progressed immediately. Cabling and piping work and mechanical equipment installation were in progress during the quarter.\nA revised environmental management plan that includes the sulphide processing was submitted to the Department of Environment (\u201cDOE\u201d) in fiscal year 2022 and was approved on September 23, 2022.\nThe production of flotation concentrate is expected to commence after completion of commissioning, anticipated in early December 2022.\nMine development was completed, with pre-stripping work finished during the quarter. The Tailing Storage Facility (\u201cTSF\u201d) expansion development to 540m RL level will continue after commencement of production.\nFlotation tests were carried out on samples of old stockpiles of transition ore that will be processed during commissioning and early ramp-up. The flotation tailings of transition ore will be stored for future Carbon-in-Leach (\u201cCIL\u201d) processing. Several flotation pilot test runs were conducted which further supports the previous observation and test result; a mill feed flotation test was carried out during this quarter which indicated the good flotation performance of above 90% of rougher recoveries.\nMurchison Gold Project\nAt Murchison, no drilling was carried out during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 in order to dedicate resources to complete the Selinsing flotation construction and commence production, the Company focused on updating Gabanintha data that might improve identifying drill targets. The Company continued to maintain the plant and other facilities, so they are operationally ready for efficient commissioning when production is restarted. Site accommodation and catering facilities are fully functional for administrative, exploration and mining activities.\nGross Revenue Royalty from Fortress\nDuring the first quarter of FY2023, the Company has begun earning royalties from Fortress Minerals Limited (\u201cFortress\u201d) on the Mengapur Project. Pursuant to the terms of the Royalty Agreement entered January 2021 with Fortress, the Company earned the first royalty of 1.25% against $1.2 million declared by Fortress.\nExploration Progress\nMalaysia\nDuring the first quarter of FY2023, to sustain the continuity of the oxide plant production, a total of 270m RC drilling over six holes was drilled at Selinsing Pit 4 and Pit 6. A total of 10 batches of RC samples comprising 317 samples including QAQC control samples were dispatched to the assay laboratory. All samples received the assay results. The drilling results at Selinsing Pit 6 confirmed the continuation of the mineralization to the down dip direction and the drilling results at Pit 4 confirmed that the high-grade zone is extended to the south direction, Carbon-in-Leach (\u201cCIL\u201d) recoveries were generally low, but the laboratory flotation response was highly satisfactory with over 90% recovery reported. The additional ore mined at Selinsing Pit 4 and Pit 6 will be processed in the flotation plant that is planned for commissioning in December 2022.\nDuring the first quarter of FY2023, to explore near surface oxide mineralisation, a total of 37 and 134 channel samples were collected at Buffalo Reef C3 pit and the south wall of C2 pit respectively. Assay results were received, and no significant result was reported. Further a total of 20 grab samples of the alluvial material was collected at a diverted Buffalo Reef C3 creek, near the known high-grade mineralisation. Assay results reported highest Au value of 0.89g/t and 12 samples were reported with Au above 0.20g/t with an average grade of 0.45g/t.\nThe areas where the materials were considered economically mineable through the above drilling were considered in the mining plan\nWestern Australia\nDuring the first quarter of FY2023, the Company received and analyzed the diamond drilling results of Phase 2 that confirmed the extension of gold mineralization, including high grades of up to 17.8g/t gold, for more than 150m vertical depth below the current Mineral Resource at the NOA group of deposits. Fiscal 2023 started with a focus on updating Gabanintha historical data to improve identifying drill targets. A full review of all historical maps with reports is ongoing for the Gabanintha project.\nAbout Monument\nMonument Mining Limited (TSX-V: MMY, FSE: D7Q1) is an established Canadian gold producer that owns and operates the Selinsing Gold Mine in Malaysia.
