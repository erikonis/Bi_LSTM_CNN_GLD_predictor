There is one thing, however, that sets them apart: valuation. That lone factor makes one appear to be the much better buy between the two right now.\nThe bull case for Yamana Gold\nLast year, Yamana Gold produced 823,264 ounces of gold along with 127.3 pounds of copper and 4.75 million ounces of silver from the five mines it currently operates across North and South America. While that's a sizable output, it's not enough to make it a top 10 gold or silver producer. The company, however, recently added a sixth location after it brought the Cerro Moro gold and silver mine in Argentina on line. Yamana believes that as Cerro Moro ramps up, gold production will increase at a 5.6% annual pace through 2020 to 970,000 ounces per year. Meanwhile, the company sees silver output rising at an even faster 37% yearly clip, pushing it up to more than 12.9 million ounces by 2020. On a gold equivalent basis, the company's output should increase almost 29% by 2020.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nThat fast-paced growth of low-cost silver and gold production should produce a \"step change in cash flow\" starting in the second half of 2018 according to the company's projections, which assume that metal prices cooperate. The surge in cash flow should enable Yamana to quickly pay down debt and get its leverage ratio down from 2.85 times last year to a more comfortable 2.0 times in the short-term. This combination of rapidly rising cash flow and an improving balance sheet has the potential to boost Yamana's value in the coming years.\nThe bull case for Agnico Eagle Mines\nAgnico Eagle Mines is a bigger mining company than Yamana. Overall, it operates eight mines that produced 1.7 million ounces of gold last year, good enough to make it the ninth-largest gold producer in the world. In addition to gold, Agnico Eagle Mines also produces some silver, zinc, and copper, though these metals only contributed 5% of its revenue in 2017. For comparison's sake, Yamana gets 16% of its revenue from copper and another 5% from silver.\nIn the near term, Agnico Eagle expects its production to decline as it depletes the reserves at two of its mines. However, the company has several expansion projects underway that should reverse that trend and help boost gold output up to 2 million ounces by 2020, good for about an 18% increase. That rising output should also expand the company's cash flow, positioning it to deliver significant free cash in 2019 if gold prices hold up. That increasing cash flow will give the company the money to pay down debt, fund new expansion projects, or boost its dividend, all of which should create more value for investors.",

The fund gained about 0.4% on Jan 4, though it lost about 0.1% after hours.\nOn the other hand, SPDR Gold Shares GLD appeared a loser. Gold, though off to a great start in 2018, lost about 0.3% on Jan 4 on dollar strength. Notably, the price of gold shares an inverse relationship with the U.S. dollar (read: 5-Year Best January Opening for Gold: ETFs in Focus).\nExpected Long-Term Winners\nNotably, many Fed officials expressed concerns about the overvaluation in stocks thanks to prolonged accommodative policies. This means the Fed could hike rates faster than expected going forward. The central bank also has started a process to reduce the Fed's balance sheet.\nRising Rates ETFs\nFidelity Dividend ETF For Rising Rates FDRR is a nice pick in this regard. The underlying index of the fund reflects the performance of stocks of large and mid-capitalization dividend-paying companies that are expected to continue to pay and grow their dividends and have a positive correlation of returns to increasing 10-year U.S. Treasury yields (read: Another Rising Rates ETF on the Way).",

Offering their latest market outlook Tuesday, investment strategists from Citigroup\u2019s wealth management arm directly questioned Winklevoss\u2019s argument--but still suggested that Bitcoin could offer better returns than gold.\n\u201cAmid record low volatility in other asset classes, the grand scale of the volatility in cryptocurrencies is welcomed as a return vehicle by many traders,\u201d the strategists from Citi Private Bank wrote in their report. \u201cWhat should the expected return of the most volatile asset class be? Generally, the highest.\u201d\nIndeed, Bitcoin has made investors far richer than gold has recently, with the cryptocurrency returning 1,116% over the past 12 months, compared to less than 12% for gold. But investors turn to gold in order to diversify their portfolio, using the metal as a safe haven protecting against a drop in the stock market. After all, gold historically has shown a negative correlation with stocks--meaning when stocks go down, gold typically rises, and vice versa.\nBitcoin, on the other hand, not only is far more volatile than both stocks and gold (as illustrated in the chart above), but trades unpredictably, even maniacally, without any relationship to other assets or even gold itself. In its analysis, Citi Private Bank found that Bitcoin\u2019s correlation to the S&P 500 was virtually zero, while its correlation with gold was .054, meaning gold and Bitcoin only trade in sync about 5% of the time--a relationship so negligible as to be insignificant.",

The team has worked exceptionally hard to advance this project from the initial discovery to a potential development project with a long life and attractive all-in sustaining costs. It is important to understand that this is a work in progress, and although still short of our investment criteria typical for West Africa, the project provides excellent optionality at higher gold prices. We are continuing to aggressively optimize the project design to improve the overall economics. Importantly, the feasibility study currently underway and due for completion in the second half of 2018 uses a 25% higher mill throughput as the base case, which will accordingly increase annual gold production and has the potential for improved project returns. We continue to aggressively explore priority targets to enhance the total resource inventory, which would generate a positive impact on project economics and mine life.\"\nThe PFS was completed jointly by IAMGOLD and Lycopodium Minerals Canada Ltd., with inputs from technical studies completed by other consultants and has an effective date of December 31, 2017. The PFS represents a comprehensive study of the technical and economic viability of a mineral project that has advanced to a stage where a preferred mining method has been established and an effective method of mineral processing has been determined. IAMGOLD is using the PFS to identify the preferred development option to demonstrate economic viability of the Project, to support Mineral Reserve disclosure, and to identify additional work recommended to support the completion of a feasibility study. Technical studies to support the completion of the feasibility study have commenced, with the study scheduled for completion in the second half of 2018.\nA technical report summarizing the PFS will be filed on SEDAR within 45 days of the date of this news release.\nPFS HIGHLIGHTS\n| Project Economics and Key Parameters | |\n| Mining Capacity | 18.0 Mtpa |\n| Milling Capacity | 2.0 Mtpa |\n| LOM Average Annual Gold Production | 95,000 oz. |\n| LOM Average Recovery Rate | 89.3% |\n| Mine Life | 13.5 years |\n| LOM Average Direct Cash Costs | $707/oz |\n| LOM Average AISC | $829/oz |\n| Average Grade | 1.64 g/t Au |\n| Average LOM Strip Ratio | 6.5:1 |\n| Estimated Initial Capital Expenditure (millions) | $249 |\n| Gold Price Assumption used in financial analysis | $1,275/oz |\n| After-tax NPV (6%) (millions) | $104 |\n| After-tax IRR | 13.3% |\n| Payback Period | 6.0 years |\n| USD Currency used with exchange rate of: CAD$ = US$0.7692 |\nMINERAL RESOURCES\nThe Mineral Resource estimate used as the basis for the study is summarized below.\n| Mineral Resources \u2013 December 31, 2017 | |||\n| Classification | Tonnes (000) | Grade (g/t Au) | Contained Ounces |\n| Indicated | 37 408 | 1.60 | 1,922 |\n| Inferred | 10 981 | 1.66 | 594 |\n| Notes: | |\n| 1. | CIM Definition Standards were followed for classification of Mineral Resources. |\n| 2. | Mineral Resources reported at a cut-off grade of 0.42 g/t Au for oxide and 0.54 g/t Au for fresh material. |\n| 3. | Mineral Resources are constrained within a pit shell estimated using long-term gold price of $1,500 per ounce, and a US$/C$ exchange rate of 1:1.30. |\n| 4. | Mineral Resources are inclusive of Reserves quoted below. |\nMINERAL RESERVES\nThe tonnes, grades, and classification of the Mineral Reserves captured within the PFS mine plan are summarized below.\n| Mineral Reserve \u2013 December 31, 2017 | |||\n| Classification | Tonnes (000) | Grade (g/t Au) | Contained Ounces (000) |\n| Proven | - | - | - |\n| Probable | 26,841 | 1.64 | 1,415 |\n| Proven & Probable | 26,841 | 1.64 | 1,415 |\n| Waste within Designed Pit | 175,700 | ||\n| Total Tonnage within Designed Pit | 202,500 |\n| Notes: | |\n| 1. | Reserves estimated assuming open pit mining methods |\n| 2. | Reserves are based on a gold price of $1,200/oz |\n| 3. | Fixed process recovery of 89.3% |\n| 4. | Mining costs ($/t processed): $15.00/t. Processing costs: $14.76/t. G&A (Include refining cost): $3.55. |\nMINING AND PROCESSING\nThe PFS study has identified the preferred development option to be a conventional truck and shovel open pit mining operation, and has determined an effective method of mineral processing to be a processing circuit incorporating primary crushing, grinding, gravity concentration and cyanide leaching, followed by gold recovery using carbon-in-pulp, stripping and electrowinning.\nOpen pit mining includes approximately 15 Mt of stripping and preproduction mining during a two year pre-production period followed by 13.5 years of production mining along with stockpile reclaim in the final years of the operation. Maximum mining rate is 18 Mt per annum. The average grade is 1.64 g/t Au and the LOM stripping ratio is 6.5:1.\nFUTURE WORK\nThe PFS recommended the completion of a feasibility study to validate and detail the elements of the development concept set out in the PFS, and which would include additional drilling, engineering studies and environmental studies, including hydrological, hydrogeological and geotechnical analyses. The recommended feasibility study work has already been initiated and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2018, using a base case processing rate of 2.5 Mtpa versus the 2.0 Mtpa used for the prefeasibility study. In addition to the feasibility study, we continue to conduct exploration activities on the Boto exploration concession to evaluate high priority targets on trend for additional mineral resources.\nQUALIFIED PERSONS\nThe 2017 Boto Gold PFS was prepared by IAMGOLD and Lycopodium Minerals Canada Ltd. and incorporates the work of IAMGOLD and Lycopodium Qualified Persons (QPs) (as defined under National Instrument 43-101).

These standards differ significantly from the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Mineral Resources which are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.\nThis document contains \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of Canadian securities legislation and \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This information and these statements, referred to herein as \"forward-looking statements\" are made as of the date of this document. Forward-looking statements relate to future events or future performance and reflect current estimates, predictions, expectations or beliefs regarding future events and include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to:\n(i) the estimated amount and grade of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves;\n(ii) the PFS representing a viable development option for the Project;\n(iii) estimates of the capital costs of constructing mine facilities and bringing a mine into production, of sustaining capital and the duration of financing payback periods;\n(iv) the estimated amount of future production, both produced and metal recovered; and,\n(v) estimates of operating costs and total costs, net cash flow, net present value and economic returns from an operating mine.\nAny statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions, expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives or future events or performance (often, but not always, using words or phrases such as \"expects\", \"anticipates\", \"plans\", \"projects\", \"estimates\", \"envisages\", \"assumes\", \"intends\", \"strategy\", \"goals\", \"objectives\" or variations thereof or stating that certain actions, events or results \"may\", \"could\", \"would\", \"might\" or \"will\" be taken, occur or be achieved, or the negative of any of these terms and similar expressions) are not statements of historical fact and may be forward-looking statements.\nAll forward-looking statements are based on IAMGOLD's or its consultants' current beliefs as well as various assumptions made by them and information currently available to them. The most significant assumptions are set forth above, but generally these assumptions include:\n(i) the presence of and continuity of metals at the Boto Gold Project at estimated grades;\n(ii) the geotechnical and metallurgical characteristics of rock conforming to sampled results; including the quantities of water and the quality of the water that must be diverted or treated during mining operations;\n(iii) the capacities and durability of various machinery and equipment;\n(iv) the availability of personnel, machinery and equipment at estimated prices and within the estimated delivery times;\n(v) currency exchange rates;\n(vi) metals sales prices and exchange rate assumed;\n(vii) appropriate discount rates applied to the cash flows in the economic analysis;\n(viii) tax rates and royalty rates applicable to the proposed mining operation;\n(ix) the availability of acceptable financing under assumed structure and costs;\n* anticipated mining losses and dilution;\n(xi) metallurgical performance;\n(xii) reasonable contingency requirements;\n(xiii) success in realizing proposed operations;\n(xiv) receipt of permits and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms; and\n(xv) the fulfillment of environmental assessment commitments and arrangements with local communities.\nAlthough management considers these assumptions to be reasonable based on information currently available to it, they may prove to be incorrect. Many forward-looking statements are made assuming the correctness of other forward looking statements, such as statements of net present value and internal rates of return, which are based on most of the other forward-looking statements and assumptions herein. The cost information is also prepared using current values, but the time for incurring the costs will be in the future and it is assumed costs will remain stable over the relevant period.\nBy their very nature, forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and specific, and risks exist that estimates, forecasts, projections and other forward-looking statements will not be achieved or that assumptions do not reflect future experience. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements as a number of important factors could cause the actual outcomes to differ materially from the beliefs, plans, objectives, expectations, anticipations, estimates assumptions and intentions expressed in such forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be generally stated as the risk that the assumptions and estimates expressed above do not occur as forecast, but specifically include, without limitation: risks relating to variations in the mineral content within the material identified as Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves from that predicted; variations in rates of recovery and extraction; the geotechnical characteristics of the rock mined or through which infrastructure is built differing from that predicted, the quantity of water that will need to be diverted or treated during mining operations being different from what is expected to be encountered during mining operations or post closure, or the rate of flow of the water being different; developments in world metals markets; risks relating to fluctuations in the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar; increases in the estimated capital and operating costs or unanticipated costs; difficulties attracting the necessary work force; increases in financing costs or adverse changes to the terms of available financing, if any; tax rates or royalties being greater than assumed; changes in development or mining plans due to changes in logistical, technical or other factors; changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined; risks relating to receipt of regulatory approvals; delays in stakeholder negotiations; changes in regulations applying to the development, operation, and closure of mining operations from what currently exists; the effects of competition in the markets in which IAMGOLD operates; operational and infrastructure risks and the additional risks described in IAMGOLD's Annual Information Form filed with SEDAR in Canada (available at www.sedar.com ) for the year ended December 31, 2016 and in the Corporation's Annual Report Form 40-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on EDGAR (available at https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html.

Higher U.S. Treasury yields and flight to safety buying drove up the U.S. Dollar, making gold a less-desirable investment. Gold traders seem to reversing this move today because they may feel the selling was overdone.\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\nMore From FXEMPIRE:\n-\nE-mini NASDAQ-100 Index (NQ) Futures Technical Analysis \u2013 February 12, 2018 Forecast\n-\nComex High Grade Copper Price Futures (HG) Technical Analysis \u2013 February 12, 2018 Forecast\n-\nGold Price Futures (GC) Technical Analysis \u2013 February 12, 2018 Forecast\n-\nCrypto Update: Reversal off Lows for Cryptocurrencies Builds",

Health and safety performance\nSafety is a core value of Roxgold. The Company regrets to report that a Lost Time Injury (\"LTI\") incident occurred in Q3 2018. The LTI was suffered by a drilling contractor's employee and marked the first LTI incident at Yaramoko since the commencement of gold production in April 2016 .\nB. Operational performance\nThe Company's gold production in Q3 2018 increased by 7% to 30,532 ounces compared to 28,410 ounces in Q3 2017. For YTD 2018, production increased by 16% to 106,812 ounces compared to 91,970 ounces in YTD 2017. The increased gold production was driven by continued improved operating performance in both the mine and processing plant.\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2018 , 87,975 tonnes of ore at 10.74 g/t were extracted from the underground mine along with completing 1,221 metres of development compared to 76,480 tonnes at 12.3 g/t of ore and 1,730 metres of development in the comparable period of the prior year. The mining tonnage increase of 15% was due to more areas available to extract ore and additional equipment increasing productivity. During the third quarter, approximately 80% of ore produced came from stoping activities which is a result of the extensive development that is in place at Yaramoko, with four open stopes available at the end of the quarter.\nDuring the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018 , 263,413 tonnes of ore at 14.04 g/t were extracted from the underground mine compared to 211,761 tonnes of ore at 14.5 g/t in the comparable period of the prior year. The increase of 24% in tonnes mined was also due to more areas available to extract ore and additional equipment increasing productivity.\nIn the third quarter of 2018, decline development at the mine reached the 4947 level, approximately 350 metres below surface. Ore development was completed on the 4998, 4981 and 4964 levels. The mine continues to be well positioned to meet future production requirements with developed reserves for stoping in line with the Company's 18 months planned stoping objectives.\nReconciliation of mined material against the Company's Reserve model and Grade Control model for the year to date is trending within the expected range. The year to date trend for the Grade Control model to actual mined shows slightly more ounces produced, driven by marginally more tonnes produced. A review and reconciliation of the April 2017 Mineral Resource estimate ahead of the preparation of the Q1 2019 Mineral Resource and Reserve Estimate has commenced.\nThe plant processed a record 78,357 tonnes at an average head grade of 12.25 g/t Au in Q3 2018 compared to 66,670 tonnes of ore at 13.6 g/t in Q3 2017. This 18% increase is a result of ongoing optimisation at the plant and translates into a unit throughput rate which is 15% above nameplate capacity. Plant availability was 94.9% during the quarter and overall recovery was 98.5% during the quarter compared to 95.8% and 98.6% respectively for the comparative period in the prior year.\nDuring the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018 , the plant processed 225,350 tonnes at an average head grade of 14.4 g/t compared to 195,784 tonnes of ore at 14.5 g/t during the comparable nine-month period in 2017. This increase is a result of increased throughput during the period. Plant availability was 94.9% during the nine-month period and overall recovery was 98.5% compared to 95.8% and 98.6% respectively for the comparative period in prior year.\nC. Financial Performance\ni) For the three-month periods ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2018 , a total of 31,400 ounces of gold were sold with revenue from gold sales totalling $37,890,000 compared to 27,912 gold ounces sold2 and gold sales2 of $35,907,000 . Revenues increased by 6% when compared to Q3 2017 as the volume sold increased by 12%. The Company realized an average gold sale price of $1,207 , a 6% decrease compared to the average sale price in Q3 2017. The average market gold price in the third quarter of 2018 was $1,213 per ounce, a 5% decrease from the Q3 2017 average.\nMine operating expenses represent mining, processing, and mine site-related general and administrative expenses. During the quarter ended September 30, 2018 , the cash operating cost1 per tonne processed totalled $177 per tonne, which is below the $190 per tonne processed achieved during Q3 2017. The variation is mainly due to increased efficiency and throughput during the period. The cash operating cost1 per ounce produced totalled $454 per ounce for the period compared to $445 per ounce in the prior period.\nThe total cash cost1 per ounce sold of $499 has decreased by 5% when compared to Q3 2017 due to lower cash operating costs per tonne produced and higher gold production. The Company generated a mine operating margin1 of $708 a reduction of 7% from $764 per ounce for Q3 2017.\nDuring the quarter ended September 30, 2018 , Roxgold invested $6,451,000 in underground mine development, representing a sustaining capital cost1 per ounce sold of $205 while the Company invested $7,196,000 at a sustaining capital cost1 per ounce sold of $258 in Q3 2017.\nThe Company continued to generate strong cash flow from mining operations1 for Q3 2018 totalling $18,593,000 (Q3 2017 - $18,028,000 ) with a site all-in sustaining cost1 of $734 per ounce sold (Q3 2017 - $779 per ounce sold) and all-in sustaining costs1 including corporate costs of $788 per ounce sold (Q3 2017 - $833 per ounce).\nii) For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017\nGold sales for the nine-month period totalled $136,903,000 from 106,770 ounces of gold ounces sold compared to $115,050,000 in gold sales2 from 91,679 gold ounces sold2. During this period, the Company's average realized gold price for the period was $1,282 per ounce sold compared to the average sale price of $1,255 in YTD 2017. The average market gold price in the nine-month period of 2018 was $1,282 per ounce, compared to $1,251 in YTD 2017.\nDuring the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018 , the cash operating cost1 per tonne processed totalled $194 per tonne, which is 6% below the $209 per tonne processed achieved during YTD 2017. The difference is mainly due to increased efficiency and throughput during the period.\nThe cash operating cost1 per ounce produced totalled $409 per ounce for the period compared to $445 per ounce in the prior period. The total cash cost1 per ounce sold of $468 compared to $496 in YTD 2017 is due to a reduction of cash operating costs offset by an increase in the blended 9-month royalty rate when compared to YTD 2017. Consequently, the Company generated a mine operating margin1 of $814 up 7% from $759 per ounce for YTD 2017.\nThe Company invested $19,721,000 in underground mine development for the nine-month period compared to $23,175,000 for the comparable period in 2017. The investments made during the nine-month period are in line with the 2018 mine plan.\nThe Company generated $75,134,000 cash flow from mining operations1 during the nine-month period compared to $61,573,000 during YTD 2017.\n4. BAGASSI SOUTH EXPANSION UPDATE\nDuring the third quarter of 2018, the Company received all permits and decrees required for Bagassi South mining and the process plant expansion. Development and construction are progressing well with overall project completion at approximately 75%. The Company has started mine development with approximately 491 metres completed to date, all structural steelwork and fabrication of the CIL tanks are complete. The Company has delivered first development ore from Bagassi South in early Q4 2018 and processing plant tie-ins are expected to occur during Q4 2018 planned maintenance stoppages.\n5. REVIEW OF FINANCIAL RESULTS\nA. Mine operating profit\nDuring the third quarter of 2018, revenues totalled $37,890,000 (Q3 2017 \u2013 $36,279,000 ) while mine operating expenses and royalties totalled $15,072,000 (Q3 2017 - $12,649,000 ) and $1,516,000 (Q3 2017 \u2013 $1,514,000 ), respectively. The increase in sales is primarily due to increased production driven by higher throughput, offset by a lower average realized gold price which decreased from $1,286 per ounce in Q3 2017 to $1,207 per ounce in Q3 2018. During the third quarter of 2018, the Company achieved a total cash cost1 per ounce sold of $454 representing a mine operating margin1 of $708 compared to $522 and $764 , respectively for the comparable period in 2017.\nDuring the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018 , revenues totalled $136,903,000 compared to $113,959,000 for the comparable period in 2017. Mine operating expenses were $45,449,000 compared to $40,480,000 while royalties paid were $6,236,000 compared to $4,620,000 . The increase in sales is primarily due to increased production driven by higher throughput and a higher average realized gold price which increased from $1,255 per ounce in YTD 2017 to $1,282 per ounce in YTD 2018. During the period, the Company achieved a total cash cost1 per ounce sold of $468 representing a mine operating margin1 of $814 compared to $496 and $759 , respectively for the same period in 2017.\nFor more information on the cash operating costs1 see the financial performance of the Mine Operating Activities section in the Company's Q3 2018 MD&A.\nDepreciation totalled $7,424,000 and $25,200,000 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 , respectively compared to $6,670,000 and $21,037,000 in the corresponding period in prior year. The increase in depreciation is a result of the Company's further investments in the underground development combined with a higher throughput in our processing facility, offset by a reduction of $588,000 in depreciation related to derecognition of finance lease liability following a contract extension with the Company's mining contractor. Refer to finance lease note 14 in the September 30, 2018 condensed interim consolidated financial statements for more information.\nB. General and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses remained consistent over prior year totalling $1,115,000 and $3,708,000 for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2018 , respectively and $1,112,000 and $3,246,000 for the corresponding period in prior year.\nC. Sustainability and other in-country costs\nSustainability and in-country costs increased to $589,000 and $1,352,000 for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2018 , respectively, compared to $352,000 and $1,125,000 in the corresponding period in prior year and reflect the increased operating tempo associated with Bagassi South. These expenditures are incurred as part of Roxgold's commitment to responsible operations in Burkina Faso including a number of sustainability and community projects.\nD. Exploration and evaluation expenses (\"E&E\"):\nExploration and evaluation expenses totalling $3,376,000 and $10,737,000 for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2018 , respectively compared to $3,004,000 and $9,865,000 for the corresponding periods in prior year. Current year expenditures reflect the regional exploration program ongoing at Houko and Kaho areas and infill drilling program at 55 Zone and Bagassi South. The 2017 program includes expenditures associated with the Bagassi South infill and extensional drilling program completed as part of the Feasibility Study on Bagassi South released on November 6 , 2017.\nE. Share-based payment\nShare-based payments totalling $127,000 and $1,381,000 for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2018 , respectively compared to $1,185,000 and $2,250,000 for the corresponding periods in the prior year. The reduction is attributed to timing of the annual DSU grants which were issued in Q2 2018 and the year to date variation is impacted by the cancellation of unvested share awards related to employee turnover within the Company.\nF. Financial income (expenses)\nThe Company's net financial income (expenses) for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 totalled $209,000 and ($1,639,000) respectively, compared to ($3,279,000) and ($12,058,000) in the comparable period of the prior year.\nThe decrease is mainly attributable to the change in the fair value of the Company's gold forward sales contracts, reduction of interest expense related to the long-term debt and the changes in the Company's foreign exchange gain (loss).\nG. Current and deferred income tax expense\nThe current income tax expense is due to the Company's past cumulative losses being fully utilized in 2018. The deferred income tax expense is due to the recognition of the deferred income tax liability as the Company is making a profit from its operations in Burkina Faso .\nH. Net income & EBITDA\nThe Company's net income for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 totalled $6,599,000 and $31,360,000 respectively, compared to $6,936,000 and $16,485,000 in the comparable period in the prior year.\nDuring the third quarter of 2018 the Company generated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\")1 of $16,932,000 representing an improvement of 18% over the EBITDA1 achieved during Q3 2017 of $14,308,000 . The nine-months ended September 30, 2018 period had EBITDA1 of $68,913,000 an increase of 54% over YTD 2017 of $44,595,000 .\nI. Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interest\nFor the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 , the income attributable to the non-controlling interest (\"NCI\") was $706,000 and $3,552,000 respectively, (2017: $1,342,000 and $3,706,000 ). The Government of Burkina Faso holds a 10% carried interest in Roxgold SANU SA the Company's operating entity. Income attributable to the NCI excludes all items within Other expenses and Financial expenses on the Company's consolidated statement of income, except for sustainability and other in-country costs, interest expense, and financing fees.\n6.

In 2017, the company produced nearly 2.6 million ounces of gold, making it the fifth largest gold producer in the world. Overall, its gold mining activities supplied the company with $2.5 billion in revenue that year, good for about 74% of the total. The rest of its revenue came from zinc (12% of 2017's sales), silver (11%), and other metals like lead and copper (3%).\nGoldcorp mines the bulk of its gold from several large-scale operations in seven countries across North and South America. The biggest contributor is the Penasquito mine in northwest Mexico, which supplied 33% of the company's total production in 2017 (including most of its silver, lead, and zinc) and 18% of revenue. Furthermore, it is among the company's lowest-cost mines, delivering an all-in sustaining cost (AISC) of just $370 an ounce. For comparison's sake, the company's average AISC that year was $825 an ounce.\nAnother major contributor is the Cerro Negro mine in Argentina, which is the company's newest, delivering its first production in 2014. It contributed 14% of Goldcorp's production in 2017 and 18% of its revenue, at below-average costs of $684 an ounce.\nOne other noteworthy mine is Pueblo Viejo in the Dominican Republic, which the company owns in a joint venture (JV) with Barrick Gold(NYSE: ABX). It's one of the largest gold mines in the world. Overall, Goldcorp owns a 40% stake in the JV, which supplied the company with 14% of its production and 17% of its revenue in 2017.\nIn addition to those operating mines, Goldcorp has several in development. One of the largest is NuevaUnion, which is a 50/50 JV with Teck Resources on one of the largest undeveloped copper-gold-molybdenum projects in Latin America. The proposed Chilean mine is still in a pre-feasibility study and, therefore, several years away from development.\nAnother major long-term project is Norte Abierto, which is also a 50/50 JV in Chile -- this time with Barrick Gold -- on one of the largest gold-copper discoveries in South America. Goldcorp just brought this project into its portfolio in 2017 after buying out Kinross Gold's (NYSE: KGC) 25% stake as well as a 25% interest from Barrick Gold.\nBuilding a gold mining giant one deal at a time\nWhile Goldcorp was the world's fifth largest producer in 2017, it didn't get there overnight. The company started out in 1994 by operating two mines: Wharf in the U.S. (which it sold to Coeur Mining in 2015) and the Red Lake mine in Canada, which it still owns to this day. The company would go on to make its first transformational acquisition nearly a decade later, buying Wheaton River in a $2 billion deal that doubled its production to more than one million ounces on an annual basis. The next year Goldcorp acquired several additional mines that have become key pillars for the company, including adding Penasquito and its 40% stake in Pueblo Viejo as well as others in Canada, Guatemala, and Honduras. Goldcorp would go on to acquire more mines and mining companies in the years that followed, as well as invest heavily in developing new gold mines.\nWhile this expansion grew Goldcorp's gold production up to nearly 3.5 million ounces by 2015, the company piled on a mountain of debt to its balance sheet in the process, hitting more than $3.6 billion by the middle of that year. The weight of that debt, along with sliding gold prices, pushed Goldcorp's stock down from a peak of around $55 a share in 2011 to the low teens by early 2018.\nGoldcorp has been working to trim its debt in recent years by selling non-core assets. As noted earlier, the company parted with its legacy Wharf mine in 2015 as one of many steps to unlock the value of its portfolio by focusing on its core assets and paying down debt. The company would go on to sell several more mines and other assets as part of a major restructuring through 2016 to refocus on its best properties. While this decision resulted in gold production falling by 1 million ounces from the peak, the company entered 2018 with just under $2 billion in debt, putting it in a better position to deliver profitable growth in the future.\nA new way forward for Goldcorp\nGoldcorp's transformation efforts culminated in early 2017 when the company unveiled an ambitious five-year growth program dubbed 20/20/20. The plan would see the company:\nIncrease production by 20%, from 2.5 million ounces of gold expected in 2018 prodiuction up to 3 million ounces by 2021.\nReduce AISC by about 20% to $700 an ounce by 2021.\nGrow gold reserves 20% from 50 million ounces in 2016 to 60 million ounces by 2021.\nDriving Goldcorp's strategy are targeted investments aimed at increasing output and reducing costs at its core mines. For example, the company is pouring $420 million into its Penasquito mine over the next few years to improve its processing facilities. One of the projects will enable Goldcorp to recover 40% of the gold that currently sits as waste in the tailings (which are materials left over after processing). Meanwhile, the company is developing new mines within existing complexes to increase production. These investments will help drive down costs, while also expanding its gold reserves.\nFurthermore, Goldcorp's plan would see the company generate increasing free cash flow, enabling it to steadily reduce net debt, with the aim of driving it toward zero within five years. That will give the company the financial flexibility to invest in its next stage of expansion projects, including the two JVs in Chile.\nDoes this make Goldcorp's stock a buy?\nIn the past, Goldcorp focused on creating one of the largest gold producers in the world by building and buying mines to move up the leaderboard. While the company did build a gold mining empire, that approach didn't create value for investors. In fact, Goldcorp's stock has underperformed the S&P 500 since its formation, with truly abysmal performance after going on its buying binge in 2004, considering that shares are down 2% in the nearly 14 years since that deal, even though gold is up almost 200%.\nGoldcorp's vision for tomorrow is quite different from that of the past, driven by its 20/20/20 strategy. That's because instead of focusing on growing the size of the company, this plan aims to increase profitability, which is the key to expanding shareholder value. If the company hits its target, it should generate more than $2.5 billion in annual EBITDA by 2021, up nearly 50% from the $1.7 billion it pulled in during 2017 -- assuming a stable gold price, which is no sure thing. However, if gold cooperates, this plan to grow profitability should make Goldcorp a more valuable company going forward. That potential to create value for investors in the coming years makes Goldcorp a compelling gold stock to consider buying in 2018.\nAn expensive stock\nThough it's worth noting that even with the company's abysmal stock performance over the past several years, shares trade at a more expensive relative valuation versus the four gold miners ahead of it on the production leaderboard:\nData source: YCharts. Chart by the author.\nAs this chart shows, Goldcorp's stock isn't just marginally more expensive than stocks of rival miners; it's by far the most expensive in the group across several valuation metrics. Because of that, investors need to weigh the upside potential of the company's 20/20/20 plan against the possibility that it could still underperform its cheaper rivals in a stable-to-rising gold price environment, unless investors remain willing to continue paying a premium for Goldcorp's stock. Given that trade-off, investors should first take a closer look at the miner's cheaper rivals before making any decisions.\nMatthew DiLallo has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

And this was the move that set in motion the rally by the U.S. Dollar.\nThe dollar was also supported by a jump in U.S. Treasury yields in reaction to the Fed\u2019s hawkish monetary policy statement. Gold becomes less attractive when rates rise because it pays neither interest nor a dividend and it becomes more expensive to foreigners because it is a dollar-denominated asset.\nEarly Monday, the headlines are saying once again that gold is up because of concerns over a trade dispute between the two largest world economies, the United States and China. The same news services made the same call early Friday.\nRather than read the headlines to determine if investors are concerned about a trade war, I think it\u2019s better to watch for safe haven buying in Treasury instruments and the Japanese Yen. If U.S. Treasurys are rising as well as the Yen then I think it\u2019s safe to say that the buying in gold today is tied to flight to safety buying. I also think that one should consider using gold as a lagging indicator of safe haven demand rather than a leading indicator.\nAs far as the trade war between the U.S. and China is concerned, we\u2019ve seen the move by the Trump administration and the retaliation by China. Both moves were already on the table so no surprises there.\nAs long as the two parties are still negotiations then there should be no real concerns for investors. If the current negotiations end abruptly then this will be a problem and gold could pick up a bid. If either the U.S. or China announce more tariffs then this could also drive buyers into gold. I think it\u2019s going to be an escalation of the trade war that could actually produce a bullish tone in gold.\nOne factor that could really get gold bulls talking would be if China slaps a duty on U.S. oil. This move would take the trade war to a new level of seriousness.",

We believe that such better times are unlikely to begin in the month of April and we would not be surprised if the consolidation continues in the month ahead.\nGold Volatile But Within Range\nThe gold prices have been trading within the larger range between the 1300 and he 1360 regions over the last few weeks and though there has been a lot of volatility between these regions over the last few weeks, there has not been any threat of a breakout. Even in the month of March, we saw that the prices touch either side of the range but failed to breakout. The threat posed by the new tariff plan for the Chinese goods that was announced by the US government led to an increase in risk and uncertainty all around the world and this helped the gold prices to move up.\nThe gold prices usually tend to rise when the risk in the markets and in the world increases. That is why the funds and investments tend to get pulled out of the stock markets and other markets that carry risk and they get invested into safe havens like gold, silver and the dollar as well. We saw a similar kind of reaction during this period which helped the gold prices to climb toward the 1360 region but as the prices approached this region, the momentum was clearly lacking and it was quite obvious that there would not be a breakout through the highs. This helped to bring in a lot of selling near the highs of the range which pushed the prices lower.\nLong Term Traders Have to Wait\nThis visit to the top of the range was preceded by a period of dollar strength as the anticipation over the rate hikes from the Fed increased. This pushed the gold prices towards the lows of the range. The Fed did hike rates in March but there was no signal for accelerated rate hikes which the market was expecting and this began a period of dollar weakness which helped the gold prices to recover from its lows. So, as we can see, there was no shortage of volatility but there was no momentum in either direction.\nWe can expect more such price action in the coming month of April. This upcoming month is unlikely to see any new thing as far as the fundamentals or economic data is concerned but what should keep the gold bulls interested is the fact that the risks and the uncertainties surrounding the imposition of the tariffs and the threat of a global trade war continues to reside just beneath the surface. This can rear its head at any point of time and if and when that happens, the gold market would be in demand again and this is the time that the bulls would like to try and generate some momentum in due course of time.",

To do so, you need to focus on situations or information that the consensus view is under-appreciating or ignoring altogether.\nIn that spirit, this is the inaugural article for a weekly series that will highlight stock market stories that have flown under the radar. In this week's column, we look at why Dow 25,000 isn't the most important milestone of the week, what a new entrant at the top of the rich lists tells us about the enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies, and why you ought to forget about willpower when it comes to achieving your goals.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nU.S. Stocks: This milestone matters more than Dow 25,000\nOn Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI) closed above 25,000 for the first time, to much fanfare in the financial media. However, as the Financial Times' Robin Wigglesworth pointed out on Friday, U.S. stocks achieved another milestone this week:\nAs of yesterday, the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) had gone 385 trading days without suffering a 5% reversal, according to Goldman Sachs. That is the third-longest streak on record, after a 386-day run that ended in 1965 and a remarkable 394-day stretch as the dot-com bubble was beginning to inflate in the mid-1990s. That record looks certain to fall later in January, with 2018 picking up the low-volatility baton smoothly from 2017.\nInvestors need to avoid being lulled by this long reversal-free climb into believing that the current level of stock market volatility is normal. It's totally abnormal: Stocks are inherently volatile -- that's one of the reasons stock investors can expect, over time, to earn superior returns to bonds and cash. It's important to remind yourself of this fact to avoid letting fear shake you out of the market once volatility returns -- which it must, inevitably.\nMy colleague Dan Caplinger has identified the four stocks that are responsible for nearly half of the Dow's leap from 20,000 to 25,000, and he discusses their prospects.\nCryptocurrencies: Is this guy really worth more than Mark Zuckerberg?\nOn Thursday, The New York Timeshighlighted an extraordinary manifestation of the speculative mania in cryptocurrencies:\nAt one point on Thursday, Chris Larsen, a Ripple co-founder who is also the largest holder of Ripple tokens, was worth more than $59 billion, according to figures from Forbes. That would have briefly vaulted Mr. Larsen ahead of Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg into fifth place on the Forbes list of the world's richest people.\nRipple co-founder and executive chairman Chris Larsen. Image source: Ripple.\nHow did Larsen achieve this feat? The article goes on to explain that the value of \"[Ripple] tokens soared more than 100% during the last week -- and more than 30,000% in the last year.\"\nThis is a striking illustration of excess at work in this mania. Ask yourself: If given the choice, which would you rather own?\nMark Zuckerberg's 14% stake in a business that, along with Google parent Alphabet Inc., dominates global digital advertising, generating an estimated $16.3 billion in free cash flow last year.\nLarsen's 5.19 billion ripples and a 17% stake in Ripple.\nThe answer ought to be obvious.\nAnother anomalous result of the ripple's astronomical rise: Ripple, the company, which owns 61% of the 100 billion ripples in existence, was valued at $235 billion on Thursday -- nearly half Facebook's market capitalization.\nMy question is inspired by the one Warren Buffett put to his shareholders in his 2011 Berkshire Hathawayannual letter in regard to another \"alternative\" currency:\nToday the world's gold stock is about 170,000 metric tons. If all of this gold were melded together, it would form a cube of about 68 feet per side. (Picture it fitting comfortably within a baseball infield.) At $1,750 per ounce -- gold's price as I write this -- its value would be $9.6 trillion. Call this cube pile A.\nBuffett went on to offer the following clues to this conundrum:\nA century from now the 400 million acres of farmland will have produced staggering amounts of corn, wheat, cotton, and other crops -- and will continue to produce that valuable bounty, whatever the currency may be. ExxonMobil will probably have delivered trillions of dollars in dividends to its owners and will also hold assets worth many more trillions (and, remember, you get 16 Exxons). The 170,000 tons of gold will be unchanged in size and still incapable of producing anything. You can fondle the cube, but it will not respond. Admittedly, when people a century from now are fearful, it's likely many will still rush to gold. I'm confident, however, that the $9.6 trillion current valuation of pile A will compound over the century at a rate far inferior to that achieved by pile B.\nIncidentally, since Buffett penned his letter in February 2012, the price of gold is down by 25%, while U.S. stocks have returned 127%.\nA better way to stick to your goals\nHave you already given up on your New Year's resolutions? Here's a tip: Forget drawing on your willpower and try to cultivate the social emotions of gratitude, compassion, and pride.\nAccording to psychology professor David DeSteno, writing in The New York Times, \"As we try to make ourselves study, work, exercise, or save money, the mental effort to keep focused and motivated increases until it seems too difficult to bear. Worse, exerting willpower can take a psychological and physical toll.\"\nThat's not entirely surprising, when one considers that \"[f]or most of our evolutionary history, none of these self-focused goals mattered or even existed. It's far more likely that what led to success was strong social bonds.\"\nAs such, DeSteno recommends cultivating instead what he calls \"social emotions\":\nReflect on what you're grateful to have been given. Allow your mind to step into the shoes of those in need and feel for them. Take pride in the small achievements on the path to your goals. Doing so will help ensure that every future New Year's Eve will have more to celebrate than to regret.\nIf you've abandoned your resolutions, financial or otherwise, give yourself permission to start fresh with a new lens that focuses on social emotions, instead trying to summon up grit.\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Others will be stuck with declining production until new mines can pick up the slack in future periods, if they can be so lucky. Simply put, it's been a bumpy ride, but it's not over yet. Here's what to watch in gold stocks in the year ahead.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nThe largest gold mining stocks\nMining behemoths Barrick Gold(NYSE: ABX) and Newmont Mining(NYSE: NEM) failed to beat the total returns of the S&P 500 in 2017, posting a 9% loss in value and 11% gain, respectively, with dividends included. Historically speaking, gold stocks rarely beat the returns of the broader market over most time periods, so this isn't very surprising. But the stock charts could be a little misleading for what lies ahead.\nBarrick Gold paid off $1.48 billion in debt through the first nine months of 2017 -- exceeding its annual target of $1.45 billion with plenty of time to spare. The furious pace of debt repayments in recent years has the gold miner on pace to lower the debt on its balance sheet from $13 billion at the end of 2014 to just $5 billion by the end of fiscal 2018. That better positions the company to respond to market volatility and invest in future growth.\nThe company is also making strides with new digital mining operations in Nevada, which have dramatically lowered all-in sustaining costs, or AISC, per ounce. Additionally, it made progress in settling a long-standing dispute between the Tanzanian government and Acacia Mining, in which it owns a 64% stake. The mining company was presented with a $190 billion (yes, with a \"b\") bill for back taxes and other fines. While the final total paid is unlikely to approach that figure, the uncertainty has been a major headwind for both companies. It may be the biggest thing to watch for Barrick Gold in 2018.\nNewmont Mining stock fared a bit better than its large peer last year, but still struggled to eclipse the S&P 500. While it boasts higher AISC per ounce than Barrick Gold at the moment, it ended the third quarter of 2017 with nearly $1 billion more in cash and $2.5 billion less debt than its peer. That could explain its relatively favorable treatment from investors.\nManagement also provided optimistic expectations for 2018 and beyond at an investor day in December. The notable highlights from the world's largest gold mining company include:\nMetric\n2018 Expectations\n2019 Expectations\nAISC\nAISC between $965 per ounce and $1,025 per ounce, compared to the prior range of $950 to $1,050 per ounce.\nAISC between $870 per ounce and $970 per ounce.\nProduction\nProduction guidance increased to 4.9 million to 5.4 million ounces, up from 4.7 million to 5.2 million ounces.\nProduction to remain at 2018 levels this year and in the range of 4.6 million to 5.1 million ounces per year through 2022.\nData source: Newmont Mining. AISC = all-in sustaining costs.\nMaintaining a healthy level of production for the next five years and reducing costs promise to boost an already strong cash flow and balance sheet. That puts Newmont Mining on solid footing for investors looking to invest in gold stocks.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nThe rest of the pack\nInvestors have quite a few medium- and smaller-sized gold stocks to choose from as well. Yamana Gold(NYSE: AUY) has gifted shareholders with some of the worst returns in the industry in recent years, but has some of the best growth prospects. That may be why the stock erupted last December for a 21% gain.\nIt promises to be a solid 2018 campaign. Not only is Yamana Gold poised to beat its full-year 2017 guidance, but it's also about to realize major production gains from its Cerro Moro mine in Argentina. The asset will deliver year-over-year production growth of 9.5% for gold and 111% for silver, to 1.03 million ounces and 10 million ounces, respectively, with additional gains in 2019. Assuming production targets are met and sustainable profits are delivered in the upcoming quarters, the stock could be ready to run in the year ahead.\nFellow gold and silver miner SSR Mining(NASDAQ: SSRM) had a rough 2017 by comparison -- and looks likely to lag behind the performance of Yamana Gold in 2018 as well. That's because the miner will be forced to live with declining production from its three major mines in the year ahead. The good news is the Chinchillas Project is expected to start up in the second half of 2018. The bad news is investors will have to wait for 2019 and beyond to capture the performance increase provided, if any is provided at all.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nNot all gold stocks will be so lucky as to have declining production as their only problem this year. Hecla Mining(NYSE: HL) doesn't appear to be nearing a breakthrough in its labor dispute with union workers, which has knocked the Lucky Friday mine offline since March 2017. Worse yet, its remaining mines aren't doing shareholders any favors, with declining production and increased costs. While a compromise to bring Lucky Friday back up is technically a potential catalyst, investors shouldn't bet on it.\nAnd despite a wild ride in late 2016 and early 2017, shares of Northern Dynasty Minerals(NYSEMKT: NAK) ended up losing 14.5% last year. The Pebble Project in Alaska is certainly oozing with potential on paper, but realizing that potential is already proving difficult in the early stages -- and the mine isn't even expected to be producing until 2024. Management missed its own deadline to find new deep-pocketed partners to aid in development and production, then announced new plans for a significantly smaller mine.\nSimilar to Hecla Mining, there are several potential catalysts on the horizon for Northern Dynasty Minerals stock, but I think its long-term potential will never be realized.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nDon't forget streaming companies\nWho said you need to mine gold to play in the space? Royalty and streaming companies Royal Gold(NASDAQ: RGLD) and Franco-Nevada Corporation(NYSE: FNV) simply purchase the rights to precious metals produced by the gold stocks wearing hard hats, then sit back and watch the cash flow accumulate. Both stocks crushed the S&P 500 in 2017, with returns of 31% and 35%, respectively, and are poised for healthy returns in the future.\nRoyal Gold reported record levels of revenue, net income, and operating cash flow in its fiscal 2017. It increased its dividend payment yet again, and is looking forward to starting up a massive gold and silver mine in Canada in the year ahead that will more than double its annual silver production. While declining production and maturing streaming agreements are something to keep an eye on, 2018 could be the company's best year yet.\nSimilarly, Franco-Nevada shareholders should have relatively little to complain about this year, although the biggest gains may be farther off. A major growth investment in First Quantum's Cobre Panama precious metals mine should begin paying big dividends... in 2019. The mine is nearly completed, but won't be commissioned until late 2018. As my Foolish colleague Reuben Gregg Brewer noted, when production does start, the streaming company \"will be able to purchase gold and silver at 20% of their spot prices until certain production levels are met, then at 50% of spot prices thereafter.\"\nThere's an added angle to investing in Franco-Nevada: Management has invested in oil and natural gas streaming rights in recent years. That looks like a smart move with the current trend in energy prices. Indeed, the company thinks the revenue from its oil and gas streams could more than double between 2016 and 2021.\nWhat does it mean for investors?\nOf course, much of the direction gold stocks take in 2018 will be determined by gold and silver prices. I didn't mention them for two reasons. First, it's much more important for investors to focus on the operational improvements and financial health of gold companies. For instance, if gold prices fall 5% in the next year but a company reduces its AISC by 15%, then the gold miner comes out ahead.\nSecond, no one can predict the future. But recent trends for the gold stocks above provide ample clues for what to watch in 2018.\nMaxx Chatsko has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

This level would mean interest rates would need to climb to 2% to create a neutral policy. The year over year rate was 1.9% in June which means inflation is accelerating. While gold prices rise to offset rising inflation, current inflation outside of the US is relatively subdued. This means that higher US inflation will likely be met with a rising dollar, which would generate headwinds for gold prices. Separately, personal spending came in at 0.4% in July which match the June figures. Personal income came in at 0.3% declining from 0.4% in June. Wages increased by 6.7% which was down slightly from the June figures.

Young and Jan Harvey NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Gold on Monday marked a new low for the year to date after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's declaration that a trade war between China and the United States was \"on hold\" helped boost appetite for higher-risk assets, such as stocks. Buoyancy in U.S. Treasury yields also weighed on appetite for non-interest-bearing assets, like bullion, analysts said. Spot gold fell to its lowest since late December at $1,281.76 an ounce, and was down 0.03 percent at $1,291.1 per ounce by 1:34 p.m. EDT (1734 GMT).

Young and Jan Harvey\nNEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Gold on Monday marked a new low for the year to date after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's declaration that a trade war between China and the United States was \"on hold\" helped boost appetite for higher-risk assets, such as stocks.\nBuoyancy in U.S. Treasury yields also weighed on appetite for non-interest-bearing assets, like bullion, analysts said.\nSpot gold fell to its lowest since late December at $1,281.76 an ounce, and was down 0.03 percent at $1,291.1 per ounce by 1:34 p.m. EDT (1734 GMT). U.S. gold futures for June delivery settled down 40 cents, or 0.03 percent, at $1,290.90 per ounce.\n\"The dollar's riding high and the 10-year (Treasury note's) yield has broken above 3.05 percent for the first time since 2011,\" said Mitsubishi analyst Jonathan Butler.\nA stronger dollar makes assets priced in the U.S. greenback more expensive for holders of other currencies, while a bounce in yields had added to pressure on gold.\n\"With the China trade news, international investors sold off gold,\" said Michael Matousek, head trader at U.S. Global Investors.\nThe world's two largest economies stepped back from the brink of a global trade war and agreed to hold further talks aimed at boosting U.S. exports to China.\nGold prices last week fell below the psychologically-important level of $1,300 an ounce, and posted the first weekly close below the 200-day moving average since late December.\nThe yellow metal is also being weighed down by expectations that the Federal Reserve will lift U.S. interest rates again next month. Higher interest rates make non-yielding assets like gold less attractive to investors.\nNaeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said investors were now looking ahead to this week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets rates.\n\"If the Fed doesn't tame its hawkish stance, we would expect more weakness in the gold price,\" he said.\nMore in News\nMitsubishi's Butler said gold could benefit from safe-haven buying in the long run if that exuberance loses steam and inflation pressures mount. But he added: \"It's possible that we might see a further correction in the very short term. That will of course depend on the newsflow, and whether the dollar can hold on to its gains.\"\nMeanwhile, platinum gained 1.9 percent at $899.50 an ounce, after also marking a fresh low for the year in earlier trade at $873.50.\nSilver was up 0.4 percent at $16.49 an ounce, while palladium, the most industrial of the major precious metals, jumped 2.9 percent to $990.72.\n(Additional reporting by Apeksha Nair in Bengaluru; editing by Adrian Croft and G Crosse)",

Additionally, investors may also be increasing bets on an accelerating economy and inflation.\nU.S. Equity Markets\nThe major U.S. stock indexes settled lower on Monday after the 10-year U.S. Treasury Note yield spiked higher, raising concerns higher interest rates would put a lid on the bull market. U.S. stocks also posted the biggest drop of the new year.\nIn the cash market, the benchmark S&P 500 Index settled at 2853.53, down 19.34 or -0.67%.

Since gold is a dollar-denominated commodity, demand for the precious metal tends to drop when the dollar rises. This is because it becomes more expensive for foreign buyers.\nAdditionally, gold does not pay interest so when rates rise, investors sell gold then move the proceeds into interest-bearing instruments.\nCrude Oil\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate and international-benchmark Brent crude oil futures tumbled on Monday as a strengthening U.S. Dollar lead to a drop in demand for the dollar-denominated commodity. Sellers also expressed concerns over rising U.S. output.\nNatural Gas\nNatural gas futures retreated on Monday after finishing last week with a strong rally. The price action may have been muted with the expiration of the February futures contract looming. An overbought market and uncertainty over the 8 to 14 day weather forecast may have also encouraged investors to book profits after last week\u2019s steep rise in prices.\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire",

This probably constitutes one of the largest corrections during the uptrend period over the last few months and presents a challenge to the oil bulls.But as we have said consistently over the last few months, we believe that the price region between $60 and $70 should keep the bulls and the bears comfortable and thats where we are now and hence we do not expect any major moves in the market in the short term.\nThe silver prices continue to flounder on either side of the $16.5 region and this is the tone of the price action that we are going to see in the coming days as well as the silver market tries hard to find a bid.\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire",

Today, you could argue it\u2019s now even cheaper. Over the past 35 years or so, gold and the S&P 500 have essentially traded around parity. Should they see some sort of mean reversion now there are $1,300 points to be made up one way or the other.\nAnd if the future for gold rhymes at all with the early-2000\u2019s period it could have much more upside over the next several years than even that head and shoulders bottom pattern would suggest.\nGenerally, I believe it\u2019s important for investors to have significant exposure to real assets like gold at all times if only for the purposes of diversification.

The share price fell, along with peers as gold bullion declined, despite the increase in our FMV estimate to $7.50 from higher reserves and resources. And our FMV excludes the prospect of higher gold prices. The company remains attractive because of its organic growth initiatives and potential for significant margin expansion from lowering costs.

Offering their latest market outlook Tuesday, investment strategists from Citigroup\u2019s wealth management arm directly questioned Winklevoss\u2019s argument\u2014but still suggested that Bitcoin could offer better returns than gold.\n\u201cAmid record low volatility in other asset classes, the grand scale of the volatility in cryptocurrencies is welcomed as a return vehicle by many traders,\u201d the strategists from Citi Private Bank wrote in their report. \u201cWhat should the expected return of the most volatile asset class be? Generally, the highest.\u201d\nIndeed, Bitcoin has made investors far richer than gold has recently, with the cryptocurrency returning 1,116% over the past 12 months, compared to less than 12% for gold. But investors turn to gold in order to diversify their portfolio, using the metal as a safe haven protecting against a drop in the stock market. After all, gold historically has shown a negative correlation with stocks\u2014meaning when stocks go down, gold typically rises, and vice versa.\nBitcoin, on the other hand, not only is far more volatile than both stocks and gold (as illustrated in the chart above), but trades unpredictably, even maniacally, without any relationship to other assets or even gold itself. In its analysis, Citi Private Bank found that Bitcoin\u2019s correlation to the S&P 500 was virtually zero, while its correlation with gold was .054, meaning gold and Bitcoin only trade in sync about 5% of the time\u2014a relationship so negligible as to be insignificant.",

Beyond this sentence there will be no mention of: inflation, monetary policy, asset allocation, etc. The analysis here will be centered around two different timeframes: weekly and daily.\nWhen we use multiple timeframe analysis, we first consult the longer-term timeframe to develop our overall thesis, and then we drill down to shorter timeframes to develop our plan. Once we have established our plan, our job is to wait for evidence that our plan has developed to the point where it provides us with an acceptable risk/reward to take action.\nLet\u2019s look at a longer-term chart first. The chart below shows the price action of spot gold prices since 2004. Each candle on the chart combines the price action of 10 trading days. Overlaid on this chart is a 20-period (each period being 10 days) or 200-day moving average. Notice a few things on this chart.\nGold (spot price) \u2013 10 day candlestick \u2013 13 years\nThe numbered points on the chart above are detailed in the bullets below. If price numbers are not clear due to scaling look to the next chart.\nGold was in a major bull market up until early 2013 when it made a lower low below the 200-day (blue) moving average.\nThe higher lows from late 2016 show that buyers are becoming more aggressive price wise. No longer are they waiting for a pullback to 1,100 1,200 1,250 or even 1,300 before they regain control. These higher lows show increased demand at higher levels; that is bullish.\nIt is taking less time between tests of resistance between 1,350-1,380. This level was tested in July of 2016 and then 14 months later in August of 2017 and then just four months later in January of this year. The more frequent tests of the supply area indicate the buyers are becoming more time-wise and are likely to regain control in the near term as they chew through that supply.\nIf gold trades above the resistance at 1,380, it will occur with a rising 200-day moving average which would confirm the buyers have finally regained control of the longer-term trend.\nOn the way down, gold traded very little volume from 1,600 down to 1,400. This is significant because there is little \u201cprice memory\u201d in that area. Less volume on the way down should make it easier for gold to climb higher without much chance of supply being released from people who bought in that area and are now trying to get out breakeven.\nNow that we have determined the weekly timeframe, it gives us reasons to look more closely at the price action in gold. We will study the daily timeframe to start to get a better sense of timing a purchase. The chart below shows the daily price (each candle shows the trading of one day) of gold from July of 2017 through Monday February 12, 2018.\nGold (spot price) \u2013 1 day candlestick \u2013 8 months\nOn the daily chart, we have three moving averages: a 10 (red), 20 (blue) and 50 (green.) Look to the numbers on the chart above to clarify the following points.\nFrom the December low to the January high, gold has only retraced 50% of that mov. This is well within what is considered a normal, healthy pullback.\nThe pullback has held above the rising 50-day moving average. The direction of this moving average shows the trend of the last 50 days continues to be higher.\nThe shorter-term (10 & 20) moving averages are sloped lower. This indicates the near-term profit-taking has not completed. Once gold can climb back above these moving averages (and they flatten to turn higher) we can assume the profit taking of the last 2 weeks has been absorbed.\nPossible trading plans for different timeframe participants\nIf you are a long-term (potential holding time of years) investor, you might want to start accumulating in this area. I personally would not continue to hold if the price were to make a lower low on the weekly timeframe. In plain English, I would use a stop under the December 2017 low of 1,236.\nIf you are an intermediate term (months) trader you could buy some in this current area and then add to a breakout above the 2018 high of 1,366.06. Buying some now with a stop below the December low would help provide a lower cost versus buying the whole amount on a break of the 2018 high.\nIf you are a shorter-term momentum trader (weeks) then you might want to wait for confirmation that a higher high is made above the rising 200-day moving average. A move above the 1,366.06 high would be confirmation of the higher high. After a higher low is made, I would place a stop below the rising 50-day moving average.\nHow to trade gold\nThe way I see it, there are three possible ways to trade gold.\nYou could use the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) which trades at approximately 1/10th the price of physical gold.\nFor me, I prefer to trade in physical bullion, and the best site I have found to do that is www.golddealer.com. I have used this company for over 15 years, and I trust them.\nWhatever way you decide to get involved in gold, or if you don\u2019t get involved at all, I encourage you to do your own research and use this information as part of your decision-making process. Trade well and manage risk!",

Gold was also being pressured ahead of the Fed\u2019s interest rate decision and monetary policy agreement. Gold traders were also optimistic ahead of the two-day meeting between the United States and China over trade issues and the \u201cpeace\u201d agreement between North Korea and South Korea.\nAt the Fed meeting, policymakers decided to leave interest rates unchanged while acknowledging that inflation was rising. However, it left no hints as to whether there would be two or three more rate hikes in 2018. This may have been enough to provide some support for gold although gains are likely to be limited because a June rate hike has already been priced into the market.\nThe meeting between the United States and China yielded no results as expected. The U.S. did present China with a list of demands which suggests there will be further meetings in the future. The presentation of the list of demands indicates the U.S. is taking a hardline approach toward trade which could lead to fresh volatility in the equity markets due to trade war fears. This may be enough to underpin gold prices.\nForecast\nGold prices found support last week inside a major technical retracement zone at $1311.40 to $1296.20. Buyers may have come in at $1302.30 in an effort to defend this zone. Trader reaction to $1311.40 should set the tone of the market early in the week. The longer-term tone will be determined by trader reaction to the entire zone.\nFundamentally, Friday\u2019s U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls report came in weaker than expected. The headline number was below expectations but the unemployment rate fell to an 18-year low. The key concern for the Fed was disappointing Average Hourly Earnings. This number may be enough to encourage the Fed to be less aggressive with interest rates which could provide some support for gold.\nWhile trade talks between the U.S. and China may have yielded no results this time, they are expected to be on-going. Nonetheless, gold could be supported if this situation creates geopolitical uncertainty.",

As a result, both companies started off 2018 with stronger businesses and a brighter outlook. However, one of these metals companies still has some lingering baggage to deal with, and that gives the other stock the edge here.\nBetter businesses today\nBefore getting too deep into Freeport's and Alcoa's businesses, it's important to remember that Freeport is a copper and gold miner while Alcoa is an aluminum company. If you are looking for copper and gold exposure, don't buy Alcoa stock, and if you want aluminum exposure, don't buy Freeport stock. With that out of the way, it's time to look at the solid improvements each company made in 2017.\nImage source: Getty Images\nThe big change for Alcoa was its separation from specialty parts maker Arconic (NYSE: ARNC) in late 2016. Effectively, 2017 was the aluminum company's first year as a stand-alone entity focused almost exclusively on the commodity side of the aluminum value chain. And it was a good year.\nAlcoa's top line advanced 25% in 2017, driven largely by higher aluminum and alumina prices. Adjusted EBITDA more than doubled, going from roughly $1.1 billion in 2016 to $2.35 billion last year. Cash on the balance sheet increased from $853 million to $1.35 billion even while long-term debt fell slightly from $1.42 billion to $1.39 billion. The aluminum giant was able to cut costs, too, taking selling, general, and administrative expenses down 20% through the year.\nFreeport-McMoRan's big change was effectively jettisoning the oil business it bought just before energy prices started to plummet in mid-2014. That ill-timed acquisition saddled the company with heavy debts and a struggling new business. Having refocused on its copper and gold mining assets, 2017 was something of a fresh start for Freeport. And it got off on the right foot performance-wise.\nThe miner's top line advanced 10% in 2017, helped along by rising copper and gold prices. Net income from continuing operations went from a loss of $2.96 per share in 2016 to a gain of $1.21 in 2017. The improvement, however, was really on the balance sheet, where Freeport was able to reduce its net debt by 18% last year to roughly $13.1 billion. That number was roughly $20 billion after the debt-funded oil acquisition in 2014. Not a bad showing at all.\nSome issues remain\nLooking forward, the performances of Alcoa and Freeport are tied to their respective commodity markets. If you are researching either company, you have to keep that in mind, because falling commodity prices can be a major headwind for both stocks. However, Freeport has one additional problem that deserves very close attention: One of its largest assets, the Grasberg Mine in Indonesia, is in a state of flux.",

For most of the week, gold was underpinned by a weaker U.S. Dollar. On Friday, however, gold managed to give back all of its weekly gains when the dollar rebounded to the upside. Driving the U.S. Dollar\u2019s price action was the investor response to fresh tariffs by the U.S. and China.\nTo recap last week\u2019s key events, the Trump administration announced it would impose a 10 percent tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. This was actually bearish news for the dollar because the market had priced in a 25 percent tariff. However, the full amount will be applied on January 1 if a new trade deal isn\u2019t made.\nChina retaliated by announcing levies targeting over 5,000 American products worth $60 billion. The new tariffs are scheduled to go into effect next week. Investors sold the dollar on this news because some thought that China would target the supply chain by preventing the export of strategic minerals and key components for U.S. electronic products.\nEssentially, it was the unwinding of long U.S. Dollar hedges that drove gold prices higher. The easing of tensions over the U.S.-China trade dispute encouraged investors to sell the dollar and buy gold.\nForecast\nThe trade dispute and the dollar will continue to drive the price action in gold this week. However, this week, the dollar could strengthen and gold could weaken. This is because China called off the trade talks with the United States and said it wouldn\u2019t meet with high level negotiators until after the November mid-term elections.\nAlso contributing to the movement in gold will be the outcome of this week\u2019s two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting which culminates with the Fed\u2019s interest rate and monetary policy decision on Wednesday, September 26.\nAlthough the Fed is widely expected to raise its benchmark interest rate during the meeting, gold traders will be primarily focused on the direction the Fed will chart ahead. Traders essentially want to know how aggressive the Fed will be in increasing rates in the future.",

Rather, I\u2019m suggesting that his diplomatic skills will be tested in a baptism of fire. Maybe it will work out, or maybe it won\u2019t. Either way, gold stocks to buy don\u2019t seem like a bad idea!\nFinally, gold prices may see a seasonality boost. Since 1999, the second quarter on a year-over-year basis produces the strongest gains. Granted, the margins are small: the second quarter averages 10.1% YOY returns, while the worst quarter (the first) produces 9.6% returns. Still, it is a statistical advantage.\nWith all that\u2019s going on right now, precious metals are a smart play. Here are seven gold stocks that will find a momentum burst this spring!\n7 Gold Stocks to Buy: Barrick Gold Corp (USA) (ABX)\nSource: Shutterstock\nOne of the biggest temptations in gold stocks is seeking out the cheapest name possible. While that could be a lucrative play, the probabilities aren\u2019t very favorable. Instead, with a potential industry upturn on the horizon, you should load up with quality investments. In the precious metals mining sector, few are as renowned as Barrick Gold Corp (USA) (NYSE:ABX).\nABX stock is intriguing particularly due to its fundamentals. Unlike lesser firms that simply folded during the metals fallout, Barrick rolled up their sleeves and got to work. Recognizing top-line hardships, management made tough but necessary decisions to streamline the organization. The results are conspicuous. Over the last four years, SGA expenses declined from $412 million to $301 million, or a 27% reduction.\nOther unnecessary operating expenses were eliminated, helping to free up $66 million from four years prior. Thanks to their efforts, ABX went from losing $2.9 billion in 2014 to producing $655 million, and $1.44 billion in net income over the past two years.\nBut despite these significant achievements, ABX stock is down 12.6%. I think this is an overreaction. Barrick is a much leaner and more efficient company than it was during the metals downturn. In addition, it\u2019s also profitable \u2013 something that not too many in the sector can say.\n7 Gold Stocks to Buy: Royal Gold, Inc (USA) (RGLD)\nSource: Shutterstock\nPure gold mining operations tend to be all-or-nothing affairs: either the project produces gold and other precious metals, or it does not. I understand that this scenario appeals to many gold stocks investors; however, other people want a reasonable exposure level to the mining industry. For the latter, Royal Gold, Inc (USA) (NASDAQ:RGLD) fits the bill perfectly.\nRoyal Gold utilizes a streaming and royalty-based business model. Among several advantages, streaming allows RGLD to gain exposure to multiple asset-producing projects without incurring onerous risk. Furthermore, the company\u2019s budgeting and planning are much more predictable and accurate since they\u2019re only dealing with actual producers. Investors love it, which is why RGLD stock has weathered the storm better the most.\nOn a YTD basis, shares are up 6.4%, which by itself is nothing to write home about. However, with benchmark indices struggling to return to black ink, RGLD has contributed a comparatively impressive performance. Moreover, we can likely anticipate increased bullishness in the near future.\nIn recent weeks, the underlying gold market turned positive for the year. Given the domestic and geopolitical uncertainties facing the Trump administration, gold could rise simply due to risk-adverse sentiment.\nWhen we think about businesses that make Fortune\u2019s most admired companies list, we usually don\u2019t consider the mining industry. Yet Newmont Mining Corp (NYSE:NEM) impressively made the list this year. Only a handful of companies within the sector joined NEM in this rare honor.\nThe question, though, is whether it will matter to potential investors. While I doubt anyone\u2019s going to buy NEM based on this distinction, it helps to draw attention to what management is doing right. For starters, company executives are optimistic about their chances in 2018, raising their gold production guidance.\nSecond, I appreciate that the optimism is translating to relative stability in the markets. NEM stock is up 4.6% YTD, and compared to its rivals, Newmont has held up well. Aside from some soft patches in February and March, NEM hasn\u2019t given shareholders reason to panic.\nWith an improving gold sector, and a potential seasonality boost, I\u2019m confident that Newmont will at least meet expectations. Ideally, I\u2019d like to see a little bit more discipline in cost efficiencies, which would help return them to profitability. However, they\u2019re growing their top line, and reducing their long-term liabilities.\nOverall, I like what I\u2019m seeing. NEM is easily one of the more intriguing gold stocks to buy!\nA significant but sometimes overlooked benefit to an industry downturn is that it forces participants to streamline their operations. To achieve this, competing organizations will consider consolidations. By pooling resources together, the combined entity will have a better chance to survive and thrive.\nFor Alamos Gold Inc (NYSE:AGI), it simply made sense to acquire Richmont Mines. Upon completion, AGI would gain high-grade projects in their portfolio while improving its balance sheet. Moreover, Alamos can maintain its cost-efficiencies, and helping it return to profitability. So far, I\u2019m impressed with the results.\nLast year, AGI rang up nearly $543 million in top-line sales, an 88% improvement from four years prior. Additionally, management has chipped away at their SGA expenses, bringing it down to $21.7 million in 2017. In the prior year, SGA had crept up to $26.5 million. Overall, Alamos\u2019 efforts delivered a $26.6 million net income after multiple years deep in the red.\nSo far, the markets are ignoring the fundamentals. On a YTD basis, NEM stock is down 16.6%. However, since hitting bottom on March 12th, NEM shares have jumped more than 11%. With potential tailwinds along the way, this smart organization could surprise Wall Street.\n7 Gold Stocks to Buy: Kinross Gold Corporation (USA) (KGC)\nSource: Shutterstock\nDespite 2018 setting up as the year to acquire gold stocks, no sector is immune from market irrationality. Case in point is Kinross Gold Corporation (USA) (NYSE:KGC). Just recently, KGC stock absorbed a painful body blow thanks to the White House imposing new Russian sanctions. Kinross will receive 20% of its precious metals production from Russia.\nOn surface level, KGC volatility appears to make sense. Like every other gold miner, Kinross is fighting back after several frustrating years. It simply can\u2019t afford a 20% production disruption.\nHowever, we shouldn\u2019t forget that KGC is a Canadian company. Yes, Canada has sometimes earned a reputation as the U.S. lackey. However, it\u2019s obvious that Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin has an issue with American dominance in geopolitical affairs.\nKinross disputes that the fresh sanctions have negatively impacted the company. They report that Russian operations are running as previously scheduled. Of course, they would say that, but I don\u2019t see an upside for the Russians to punish a Canadian miner. Russia\u2019s economy isn\u2019t exactly a shining beacon, and they\u2019ll be hurting themselves unnecessarily.\nThus, I think the extreme selloff in KGC stock is a contrarian opportunity. Furthermore, management has really cleaned out their cost of goods sold, as well as their operating expenses. The end result is a company that is finally profitable.\nThis latest news is nothing more than irrational drama. Feel free to put KGC in your gold stocks to buy list.\n7 Gold Stocks to Buy: Iamgold Corp (IAG)\nSource: Shutterstock\nJust like with the broader market uncertainty, investors are better served going with strong companies stuck in weak circumstances. In this manner, you can increase your odds that the name you acquire is a genuine discount, and not one that keeps dropping!\nIamgold Corp (NYSE:IAG) is one of my top choices for gold stocks to buy because of its fundamentals. Sure, IAG is well off from last year\u2019s highs, but I\u2019m more interested in the comeback probability. I don\u2019t like risking money on a cheap stock simply because it\u2019s cheap.\nWith IAG, I have the confidence that I\u2019m not throwing money in the wind. The last four years have been tough on every gold miner. That said, I\u2019m impressed with how Iamgold has handled the industry pressure. Management maintained cost discipline, keeping SGA expenses stable. Moreover, they\u2019ve significantly reduced other operating expenses, which helped produce profits in 2016 and 2017.\nOn the balance sheet side, IAG has whittled down long-term debt. Free cash flow has generally turned positive, which should aid in the day-to-day operations.\nThe only issue is that the markets don\u2019t value management\u2019s efforts, with IAG stock down 12% YTD. That said, I think Wall Street is missing the bigger picture. Gold is a long-deflated sector that\u2019s overdue for a recovery rally. In addition, IAG has significantly streamlined its business.\nNo gold stocks to buy list is complete without mentioning at least one speculative name: just the fact that you\u2019re interested in gold means you\u2019re probably willing to stomach some risk. My best gamble in this sector? I\u2019m going to go with Yamana Gold Inc. (NYSE:AUY).\nA few years back, AUY was one of the top gold stocks by market capitalization. It\u2019s still a highly respected name, but the company lost a significant amount of its luster. On a YTD basis, AUY shed more than 11%. Over the last five years, the company hemorrhaged a devastating 78.5%.\nLooking at its financials, you can see why investors have run for the exits. Revenues have been stagnant in a deflating sector, leading to sharp earnings losses. Unlike other companies, AUY hasn\u2019t improved its balance sheet, and its free cash flow is a mess.\nOn the flipside, management has expended significant effort curbing operating expenses. Subsequently, its earnings, while negative, are substantially paring losses. With enough time, AUY could potentially turn the ship around.\nHow likely is this scenario? I\u2019m not sure, which is the gamble. However, gold sentiment overall is positive, and will probably continue improving. Also, for what it\u2019s worth, seasonality trends are favorable.\nIt\u2019s a long shot, but AUY has the right stuff to surprise!\nAs of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long gold bullion.",

The dollar slumped almost 10% in 2017, marking its worst performance since 2003, even though the dollar had started that year on a high, riding hopes that President Trump would implement pro-growth and pro-inflation measures.\nHowever, concerns about Trump\u2019s ability to push through those policies started to weigh on the greenback soon. Further, it lost steam as growth picked up outside the United States, with other countries\u2019 central banks moving toward tighter monetary policy, consequently narrowing the gap between the Federal Reserve and others. Moreover, tensions regarding North Korea and persistently low U.S. inflation led to the decline.\nDemand Dips in First Nine Months of 2017\nPer the data available from the World Gold Council, global gold demand declined 9% year over year to 915 tons in the third quarter of 2017 \u2014 at par with levels last seen in the third quarter of 2009. In the first three quarters of 2017, demand for the yellow metal was down 12%. Let\u2019s have a detailed look at what led to the decline.\nJewelry Demand: Strength in China & United States, India Disappoints\nAfter recording growth in the first half of 2017, demand for jewelry dipped 3% year over year to 479 tons in the third quarter \u2014 the weakest third quarter on record. Nonetheless, China witnessed a boost of 13% on festive buying after 10 consecutive quarters of decline. Moreover, the United States marked the strongest third quarter in the last five years, driven by economic growth, improving employment levels and growth in consumer confidence.\nNotably, India witnessed the main drag on jewelry demand in the quarter, declining 25% after three straight quarters of growth. The introduction of the 3% Goods and Services Tax (GST) at the beginning of July affected sales. In anticipation of the tax, customers had also moved their purchases to the second quarter.\nAdditionally, to make matters worse for the industry, the government brought the gems and jewelry industry under the purview of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (\u201cPMLA\u201d) in August. The Act required declaration of documentation for certain jewelry transactions. This deterred customers in rural India as they shied away from providing necessary documents. Further, inconsistent rainfall had its toll on gold jewelry buying in rural India, which is a major market.\nIn October, the India jewelry industry heaved a sigh of relief as the government removed the industry from the purview of the PMLA \u2014 a well-timed step, ahead of the festive season. As a result, consumer sentiment improved dramatically.\nTotal Investment Demand Suffers on Modest ETF Inflows\nTotal investment demand plunged 28% to 334.5 tons in the third quarter. ETF inflows were 18.9 tons, down from the record inflow levels of 144.3 tons in the prior-year quarter. In fact, the U.S.-North Korea imbroglio, along with its constant threat of nuclear conflict, had stoked the demand for gold investment for the first time.\nHowever, as it became clear in September that the Fed is likely to raise rates in December, investment in ETFs was affected. Also, stock markets at new highs led to the modest ETF inflows.\nMeanwhile, global bar and coin demand improved 17% year over year to 222.3 tons on the back of robust demand in China. Currently, the country is witnessing the second highest volume on record in 2017. The volume is being aided by fears related to potential depreciation of the yuan, concerns over rising inflation and lack of alternative investment opportunities.\nDemand from Central Bank, Technology Show Resilience\nCentral banks purchased 111 tons in the third quarter, up 25% year over year. This brought the total to 289.6 tons year to date, down 3% year over year. Russia, Turkey and Kazakhstan remained primary buyers. Demand for gold in technology improved 2% year over year to 84.2 tons in the third quarter, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of growth.\nSupply Growth Continues in the Red: Signal of Caution?\nTotal gold supply contracted by 2% to 1,146 tons in the third quarter. Recycled gold supply declined 6% year over year to 315.4 tons and mine production was down around 1% year over year to 841 tons. However, on a positive note, production in the first nine month period of 2017 was at a record high of 2,420 tons.\nProduction in China continued to decrease for five consecutive quarters due to stringent environmental regulations. In Tanzania, an ongoing dispute between the government and Acacia Mining led to a 15% fall in production.\nSector Level Earnings Trend\nPer the Zacks classification, the gold-mining industry comes under the broader Basic Materials sector. The sector\u2019s earnings rose 2.7% in the third quarter, a deceleration from growth of 7% witnessed in second-quarter 2017 and 13.5% in the first.\nHowever, the sector is likely to bounce back in the fourth quarter with an impressive 26.9% projection for earnings growth. Thereafter in 2018, the sector is expected to log growth of 18.9%, 14.8%, 8.7% and 5.6% in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2018 respectively. (For a detailed look at the earnings outlook for this sector and others, please read our Earnings Trends report.)\nIndustry Ranking \u2013 Positive\nThe Zacks Industry Rank relies on the same estimate revisions methodology that drives the Zacks Rank for stocks. The way to look at the complete list of industries is that, we put our X industries (all 265 of them) into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).\nIn the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1. Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry Rank\nWithin the Zacks Industry classification, the gold mining industry is grouped under the Basic Materials sector (one of 16 Zacks sectors). The gold mining industry occupies a space in the top half of the Zacks classified industries with a Rank of #104.\nAttractive Valuation, Upside Remains\nThe Gold Mining industry has advanced 5% compared with the S&P 500\u2019s growth of 22.8% in the past year. Going by the EV/EBITDA multiple (a preferred valuation metric for mining companies that have high capital expenditures), the gold mining industry has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA multiple of 7.65, much lower than the S&P 500\u2019s EV/EBITDA multiple of 12.33. The industry\u2019s lower-than-market positioning calls for some more upside in the quarters ahead.\nWhere Is the Industry Headed?\nPer the World Gold Council CEO, Aram Shishmanian, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about gold\u2019s performance in 2018. He noted \u201cU.S. interest rates may be rising but a lot is priced into the curve already and the direction of the dollar remains uncertain. Meanwhile, the long bull market in equities raises serious questions about prospects for stock prices.\u201d\nA number of new mines entered production in fourth-quarter 2017, which might support mine production till 2018. Noteworthy mines include The Natalka project in Russia, Canada\u2019s Rainy River project and Hound\u00e9 in Burkino Faso. However, in China, the largest producer since 2007, production will bear the impact of recently imposed regulations, which target the discharge of cyanide in tailings for few quarters.\nOn the demand side, major markets, India and its neighbor China will continue to be growth drivers. Last year, the Indian market had suffered a setback due to the impact of imposition of Good and Service Tax (\u201cGST\u201d) and anti-money laundering legislation (\u201cAML\u201d) around jewelry retail transactions. We expect it to bounce back as the market adapts to GST.\nPent-up demand as well as festive buying is anticipated to boost demand for jewelry in the country. Moreover, government measures like mandatory hallmarking in 2018, is likely to be a positive for the industry. In China, retail demand remains high around the Chinese New Year.\nMacroeconomic trends in Asia will support economic growth in the coming years. Given that gold demand is generally closely correlated to increasing wealth in the continent, gold demand will increase in tandem. In Asia, gold demand is mainly retail in nature, due to festival and wedding related buying activities in countries like India and China.\nFurther, the United States continues to be a strong market driven by economic growth, improving employment levels and growth in consumer confidence. Elsewhere, Germany\u2019s economy is expected to maintain momentum while unemployment is anticipated to continue declining, providing support for the world\u2019s third-largest bar and coin market.\nDemands from central banks also remain strong with Turkish and Russian central banks adding to their gold reserves. Further, gold is witnessing increased demand in technology, bolstered by demand for high-end smartphones after years of declines.\nIn the United States, even though there are positive expectations about President Trump\u2019s economic proposals, there are also concerns. Further, the United States-North Korea imbroglio has stoked the prices for gold. Mounting fears regarding what\u2019s next \u2014 negotiation or war \u2014 works in favor of gold which is considered a good store of value during political turmoil.\nWhile demand will remain strong, supply of this precious metal has already attained peak levels as per reports. Per the World Gold Council, the project pipeline will experience a small pick-up in 2018 before global mine production levels begin to decline in 2019. The combination of lower mined gold supply and higher demand could eventually propel the prices north.\nHow to Play the Industry\nSolid ranking, low valuation and earnings growth expectation makes a good investment case for the gold mining industry now. Investors can consider the following gold stocks that are backed by a solid Zacks Rank.\nBarrick Gold has an expected earnings growth of 16.89% for 2018 and 11.01% for fiscal 2019. Franco-Nevada Corp. has an expected earnings growth of 6.81% for fiscal 2018 and 14.40% for fiscal 2019. Sandstorm Gold has an expected earnings growth of 90.91% for fiscal 2018 and 100% for fiscal 2019.\nHowever, we suggest staying away from or getting rid of Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stocks such as Asanko Gold Inc. (AKG \u2013 Free Report) , Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd. (KL \u2013 Free Report) and Pershing Gold Corp. (PGLC \u2013 Free Report).\nThe VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX) was unchanged in premarket trading Wednesday. Year-to-date, GDX has gained 4.86%, versus a 3.79% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.",

Nonetheless, there\u2019s a range of emerging catalysts that could buoy the price of gold, the key one being the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China.\nAnd these factors, along with heightened risk of another economic crisis in the European Union as well as an array of geopolitical fissures, could support higher gold in the coming months. An increasingly attractive means of playing higher gold is small-cap miner Dundee Precious Metals Inc. (TSX:DPM).\nNow what?\nDundee owns a globally diversified portfolio of precious metals properties that span the length and breadth of the development lifecycle from early stage exploration to operational mines. The company\u2019s flagship asset is the Chelopech underground mine in Bulgaria, which has reserves of 1.9 million gold ounces with an average grade of 3.13 grams of gold per tonne of ore. When the Krumovgrad open pit mine in Bulgaria, which is currently being developed and scheduled for commissioning at the end of 2018, is included, Dundee has total gold reserves of 2.7 million ounces.\nOne pleasing aspect of Dundee\u2019s operations is their low costs. For the first quarter 2018, the miner reported all-in sustaining costs of US$696 per ounce produced, which was not only 2% lower than a year earlier, but also places Dundee among some of the lowest miners in the industry. That underscores just how profitable Dundee is amid an operating environment in which gold is trading at over US$1,200 an ounce.\nNotably, Dundee has been able to steadily grow production reporting record 2017 gold production at Chelopech of 197,684 ounces, which was in excess of its annual guidance. For the first quarter, 2018 gold output was 57,331 ounces \u2014 a remarkable 24% increase year over year, thereby putting Dundee on track to achieve its 2018 production guidance of 165,000 to 195,000 gold ounces.\nProduction at Chelopech should continue to grow as costs fall, as Dundee is focused on digitising the mine and implementing automated mine processes, which should drive greater efficiencies and reduce maintenance downtime. When the Krumovgrad mine comes online, it will add a further 85,700 ounces of gold to Dundee\u2019s annual production, thereby giving its cash flow and earnings a solid lift.\nDundee expects that its annual gold production will eventually grow to over 350,000 ounces with average all-in sustaining costs of US$609 per ounce produced. That will make it one of the lowest cost producers in the gold mining industry, thereby underscoring the miner\u2019s profitability, particularly in an operating environment that sees gold trading at over US$1,200 an ounce.",

Image source: Getty Images.\nDigging into Barrick Gold\nBarrick Gold is the largest gold miner in the world, producing 5.32 million ounces of the precious metal in 2017. While that was down from 5.53 million ounces in 2016 -- and well off the company's peak from a few years ago -- it was enough to edge out Newmont Mining's (NYSE: NEM) 5.27 million ounces for the top spot. In addition to gold, Barrick also produced 413 million pounds of copper, which -- while significant -- pales in comparison to Freeport-McMoRan's 3.7 billion pounds, enough to make it the world's largest publicly traded copper producer.\nGiven how much gold Barrick produces, it's no surprise to see that this precious metal supplies it with the bulk of its revenue. In 2017, Barrick Gold hauled in $8.4 billion of revenue, with 91% of that coming from gold, 7% from copper, and just 2% from other sources, which includes by-products produced from its gold and copper mines. That's a much higher gold weighting than fellow gold producer Goldcorp(NYSE: GG), for example, which only received 74% of its revenue from the precious metal in 2017. It's a noteworthy difference for gold investors because it implies that Barrick Gold has more exposure to the price of gold than some rivals, meaning its profitability and stock price should rise and fall to a greater extent when gold makes a big move.\nBarrick Gold mines these metals from operations that span the globe. However, the bulk comes from its stakes in four core gold mines. The company's most important asset is Barrick Nevada, which is an integrated gold mine that combines its Cortez and Goldstrike properties in Nevada. In 2017, the company pulled out 2.3 million ounces of gold from Barrick Nevada, which was 43% of total production. This operation also boasts low all-in sustaining costs (ASIC) -- the all-encompassing production cost -- of $624 an ounce, which was below the company average of $750 in 2017.\nThe second-largest contributor is Pueblo Viejo in the Dominican Republic, which is one of the largest gold mines in the world. Barrick Gold operates this mine as 60-40 joint venture (JV) with Goldcorp. In 2017, it supplied Barrick with 650,000 ounces of gold, good for 12% of its total production. This mine also features below-average costs of $525 an ounce.\nWhile not one of its core mines, another notable one is the Kalgoorlie \"Super Pit\" in Australia, which is one of the largest open-pit mines in the world. Barrick Gold held this mine through a 50-50 JV with Newmont Mining and received 368,000 ounces from its share of the mine's production in 2017. Joint ventures like these are common in the mining industry because they help companies share the initial development risk as they build new mines.\nIn addition to those gold mines, Barrick Gold also owns stakes in three copper mines. The biggest contributor is the Lumwana mine in Zambia, which produced 256 million pounds of copper last year. The company also owns 50% stakes in the Zaldivar mine in Chile and Jabal Sayid in Saudi Arabia. While copper helps diversify Barrick's revenue sources and increase its growth prospects, it's overall contribution remains small.\nClimbing the gold-mining leaderboard one deal at a time\nPeter Munk initially created Barrick to invest in the oil and gas industry in the early 1980's, calling it Barrick Petroleum. However, after quickly losing big in the oil market due to slumping crude prices, he turned his sights to the gold market where he saw an opportunity. He renamed the company Barrick Resources and quickly exited the oil market. He took his gold venture public on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 1983 and would go on to buy several gold mines and mining companies in the years that followed in both Canada and the U.S., including purchasing the Goldstrike mine in 1986.\nThese acquisitions steadily moved the company up the leaderboard. Barrick would go on to stake its claim as the third-largest gold producer in the world in 1994 after buying Lac Minerals. The company moved up one more notch in 2001 when it purchased Homestake Mining Company for $2.3 billion. Barrick finally claimed to the top spot five years later when it paid $10.4 billion to buy Placer Dome. These acquisitions not only added producing mines but development projects. Placer Dome, for example, brought Pueblo Viejo into the fold, which at the time was under development.\nBarrick Gold has remained active in the mergers and acquisitions market since it vaulted to the top spot more than a decade ago. Its most recent deal of note was the purchase of Equinox Minerals for $7.69 billion in 2011. However, instead of bolstering the company's lead in the gold market, Equinox diversified it into copper.\nThe cost of becoming king of the hill\nThe purchase of Equinox Minerals was a bad idea in hindsight because it loaded the company with debt just as commodity prices tumbled. That buying binge would eventually take a toll on Barrick Gold's balance sheet because the company had taken on a mountain of debt to become a leading gold and copper producer. By 2013, the company had more than $15 billion in debt outstanding, which began weighing on its stock price as gold started falling from its peak:\nThat led the company to undertake a plan to sell off some of its higher cost non-core mines so that it could chip away at debt. The company would go on to complete several mine sales and joint ventures, which pushed debt down to $6.4 billion by the end of 2017. Barrick hopes to get that number to about $5 billion by the end of 2018.\nHowever, while the asset sales have helped improve the mining giant's balance sheet, they've also started cutting away at its lead over Newmont Mining as the world's largest gold producer. In fact, it will likely cede that title this year given the production forecasts of both companies. While Barrick initially thought that it would benefit from being the biggest miner due to lower costs from the greater scale, that hasn't been the case, which is why it's now willing to give up that title.\nThe $5 billion hole in the ground\nBefore we look ahead, no review of Barrick Gold would be complete without mentioning the company's biggest misstep: The development of the Pascua-Lama mine that straddles the border of Argentina and Chile. It's one of the largest untapped gold reserves in the world and would feature an ultralow AISC if complete. However, Barrick has wasted billions of dollars on that mine over the years with nothing to show.\nThe company initially started developing it in 2004 and had planned to invest about $1 billion. However, by the time Barrick began work in 2009, the company estimated it would cost between $2.8 billion to $3 billion. Cost estimates continued escalating and reached $8.5 billion by 2012. The company decided to suspend work early the next year after sinking $5 billion into the yet-unfinished project.\nBarrick Gold is still trying to figure out the best way to develop this resource, which, while an option for the future, doesn't currently meet the company's risk/reward criteria. Not only does it have to overcome some major logistical issues, but Chile has ordered the company to close its facilities in that country.\nThe new Barrick Gold\nBarrick Gold invested billions of dollars over the years to become the world's largest gold producer. However, that growth hasn't created any value for investors. In fact, Barrick Gold's shares currently sit nearly 40% below where they traded on the day the company made the production doubling move to acquire Lac Minerals in 1994, which is stunning underperformance considering that the price of gold is up 250% over that time frame.\nThat poor performance is leading Barrick to shift its focus away from growing gold production and toward increasing cash flow. The miner aims to build a business that can sustainably deliver free cash flow at a gold price of $1,000 an ounce. That starts with reducing costs not only through operational improvements but by jettisoning higher-cost mines and using the proceeds to retire debt. The company's strategy also features investing in high-return capital projects that meet a strict return hurdle and focusing on growing cash flow instead of production.\nAs a result of this new strategy, Barrick Gold only expects to produce 4.5 million to 5 million ounces of gold in 2018, with output slipping further to an average of 4.2 million to 4.6 million ounces from 2019 through 2022. The company will likely lose its crown as the world's largest gold producer to Newmont Mining in 2018 since its peer sees output averaging between 4.9 million to 5.4 million ounces over the next two years. However, Barrick believes its smaller production base will be more profitable because it should benefit from a lower AISC of $750 to $875 an ounce through 2022, which would enable the company to generate free cash flow even if gold falls to $1,000 an ounce.\nDoes this make Barrick Gold stock a buy?\nIn the past, Barrick Gold made the disastrous mistake of focusing on building a gold mining empire instead of growing the value of the company. Those value-destroying ways, however, appear to be in the rearview mirror. The company has already closed or sold several of its less profitable mines to focus on those that create the most value. This approach should see the company generate excess cash even if gold falls back to $1,000 an ounce while positioning it to haul in a windfall when gold is above that level. If Barrick Gold continues using that money to pay down debt, invest in high-return capital projects, and return cash to investors via a rising dividend or a buyback, it should create value for investors from here if the price of gold cooperates.\nThat reliance on the price of gold for some of its success is worth highlighting because an investor first needs to be bullish on gold's prospects before buying this stock. In addition to that, they need to firmly believe in Barrick Gold's turnaround plan, which the company hasn't defined as clearly as Goldcorp's 20/20/20 plan. Finally, investors need to be comfortable with the company's current valuation, which is in the middle of the pack compared to the next four largest gold miners:\nData source: YCharts. Chart by the author.\nWhile Barrick Gold stock isn't as pricey as Goldcorp, it's also not as cheap as AngloGold Ashanti, which has the highest AISC among the top five producers and has struggled through some missteps of its own in recent years. Because of that, it's not a screaming buy. However, its turnaround plan still has the potential to create value for investors in the coming years even if the price of gold slips, which makes it a compelling stock for gold bulls to consider.\nMatthew DiLallo has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

An upbeat global economy and hopes of tax reform in the United States marred the safe-haven demand of the metal. Plus, heightened prospects of a Fed rate hike boosted yields and the greenback. This in turn weighed on the non-interest-bearing asset like gold.\nHowever, the slump was for a short while. Post Fed meeting, gold gained strength as the meeting was less hawkish than expected. Overall, gold bullion ETF SPDR Gold Shares GLD gained about 13.3% in the last one year (as of Jan 2, 2017) (read: ETF Winners & Losers Post Partly Dovish Fed Meet).\nWhat\u2019s in Store?\nThe greenback\u2019s lack of strength can be instrumental in driving gold\u2019s future strength. The U.S. currency dropped to a four-month low against the euro on Jan 2, as the economy in the Euro zone is also gathering steam (read: After a Stellar 2017, Will Euro ETFs Beat Greenback in 2018?).\nThough the Republican tax bill has been passed, it is largely priced in at the current level and traders are still confused as to how much gains can be reaped from this tax reform by the economy, if we go by an article published on MarketWatch.\nBottom Line\nAs of now, the metal seems due for a rally. So, investors intending to profit out of the new-found optimism in the gold space may consider gold ETFs like GLD, iShares Gold Trust IAU and ETFS Physical Swiss Gold Shares SGOL.\nFor fatter returns, investors can also play leveraged products like VelocityShares 3x Long Gold ETN UGLD, DB Gold Double Long ETN DGP and ProShares Ultra Gold UGL. However, leveraged ETF plays involve greater risk.\nHaving said that, we would like to note that the journey of gold largely depends on the global economic growth momentum and how fast inflation gathers momentum. If these factors materialize meaningfully, gold prices may succumb to a slowdown. And if demand from the key-consuming nations like India and China look up and geopolitical tensions flare up, we may see gold prices marching higher.",

Even when the dollar strength waned, the pound bulls could not do much to push the pair higher and this has led to a weak close for the month for the pound and this is likely to continue in the coming month of March.\nIn March, we have a slew of data from the US in the first couple of weeks and it is also expected that the Fed would raise the rates for the first time this year in March. The market is already pricing in 3 rate hikes from the Fed this year and it is possible that the hawkish incoming data from the US could encourage the Fed to go for even 4 rate hikes and if that happens, then the pound is likely to come under some serious pressure, especially if the BOE is unable to react with its own rate hikes in the coming months. This could see the GBPUSD pair move towards the 1.35 region in the coming month.\nUSDJPY Searching for Support\nThe USDJPY pair continued to move lower during the month of February as the weakening dollar, towards the end of the month, and the strengthening yen contributed to the move lower. But it seems to have found some support in the 105 region which we believe, should support the pair in the short term as the bulls and the bears fight it out for control. We believe that there is a stronger support in the 102 region which is likely to be the target of the bears in the coming weeks.\nThe strength of the dollar has been waxing and waning over the last month or so and this is likely to continue in the coming month. As mentioned above, the Fed is expected to raise rates in March and this is likely to lend some support to the dollar which could in turn lead to a rebound in the pair in the coming month from the 105 region. But if the Fed disappoints in its minutes and press conference or does not hike at all, then we could see some dollar selling which could then lead to the pair towards the 102 region from where, we can safely expect a strong bounce.",

This will help gold regain its ground.\nWhat is Going Against the Yellow Metal?\nStronger Dollar: The constant threat of an escalating trade conflict between the United States and China led investors to seek safe haven in dollar. This has also weakened yuan, making gold expensive in the world's largest consumer, China. Notably, a stronger dollar makes dollar-priced gold costlier for non-US investors.\nStrong Manufacturing Data: The dollar also received extra boost from economic data that showed manufacturing growing at its fastest pace in 14 years. Per the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s (\u201cISM\u201d) latest report, manufacturing index advanced to a reading of 61.3% in August, up from July\u2019s 58.1% and ahead of the consensus mark of 57.2%. The index shows business conditions in the U.S. manufacturing sector and is considered a significant indicator of the overall economic condition in the United States. A reading above 50 is seen as a sign of economic growth. The August PMI indicates growth for the 112th consecutive month in the overall economy and the 24th straight month of growth in the manufacturing sector.\nRobust Labor Market: The U.S. economy added 201,000 jobs in August, ahead of the consensus estimate of 193,000, adding jobs for the 95th straight month. Average hourly wages accelerated 10 cents to $27.16, driving the year-over-year increase to 2.9%, the biggest yearly rise since April 2009. The unemployment rate held steady at 3.9% \u2014 at a 19-year low.\nRate Hike Expectations Triggered: All these upbeat numbers have raised the prospects of the Fed hiking interest rates two more times this year with one expected in its FOMC meeting on Sep 25-26. Per current market speculations, there is a very high possibility of nearly 96% for a rate hike in the current month. Higher U.S. rates dent the appeal of gold as it does not offer much interest.\nIndia Holds the Key to Recovery\nIndia is likely to aid gold recover its lost sheen as reinforced by recent data from the country. India sources nearly all of its gold demand from abroad, net gold imports is considered as an indicator for total Indian gold demand. After falling in the first six months of the year, gold imports have picked up since July. Per a report by the GFMS team at Thomson Reuters, India\u2019s gold imports were at 100 tons in August 2018, a year-over-year surge of 116.5%. Lower prices prompted jewelers to buy ahead and replenish inventory for an international jewelry exhibition.\nIndia annually consumes 800-850 tons of gold and rural India accounts for 60% of the country's gold consumption. Consequently, the demand is tied to rural populace which depends on monsoon. The monsoon period stretching from June to August traditionally exhibit a sluggish rate of purchase as most farmers are busy planting crops. A bumper crop following a good monsoon generally leads to surge in gold demand as farmers buy gold as a store of wealth for their earnings. So there is a chance of pick-up in gold demand in the latter half of the year. Further, the Indian government announced measures to bolster rural incomes. This along with forecast for a normal monsoon bodes well for the rural sector.\nFurther, the second half of the year is seasonally stronger in the country as demand increases around the wedding and festive seasons, when buying the yellow metal is considered auspicious. This begins from mid-to-late August and continues until January. Expenditure on gold can account for almost 30% of the total wedding cost. This gives a boost to local currency demand and raises gold prices.\nAccording to a report by the World Gold Council based on annual data from 1990 to 2015, gold demand is driven by income. For an increase of 1% in income per capita, gold demand rises by 1%. Consequently, the expanding middle class in India, combined with broader economic growth, will have a significant impact on gold demand, going forward.\nIndustry Valuation is Inexpensive\nThe Zacks Mining \u2013 Gold Industry, which falls within the broader Zacks Basic Materials Sector, has underperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector year-to-date. The industry has declined 32% while the Zacks Basic Material Sector dropped 1% and the Zacks S&P 500 Composite gained 16%.\nOne-Year Price Performance\nHowever, the valuation looks really cheap now. One might get a good sense of the industry\u2019s relative valuation by looking at its Enterprise Value to Earnings before Interest Depreciation and Amortization (EV/EBITDA). This valuation is a good measure for the industry\u2019s given its complicated and capital-intensive nature.\nThe industry currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 6.6, which looks inexpensive when compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio for the S&P 500 is 11.8.\nA comparison of the industry\u2019s EV/EBITDA ratio with that of its broader sector ensures that the industry is trading at a decent discount. The Zacks Basic Material Sector\u2019s trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 7.8 is way above the Zacks Mining \u2013 Gold Industry\u2019s EV/EBITDA ratio of 6.6.\nHow to Play the Industry?\nWe suggest a few gold stocks that have a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and are witnessing upward estimate revisions. Earnings estimate revisions are the most powerful force impacting stock prices. Stocks with rising earnings estimates have a tendency to perform better than the other stocks in the group even if the industry fundamentals remain sluggish. Below we have highlighted some of them:\nNorthern Dynasty Minerals Ltd. NAK\nVancouver, Canada-based Northern Dynasty Minerals acquires, explores and develops mineral properties in the United States. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Northern Dynasty Minerals is at a loss per share of 3 cents per share for fiscal 2018, an improvement from the prior estimate of a loss per share of 12 cents over the past 60 days.

Investors seemed unfazed by renewed stock market volatility which usually fuels movement into the safe haven gold market.\nApril Comex Gold futures settled at $1315.70, down $21.60 or -1.62%.\nRising U.S. Treasury yields have been triggering violent responses in the financial markets since the first week in February. A rise in the U.S. 10-year Treasury Note above 2.70 percent to 2.885 percent triggered a massive sell-off in U.S. equity markets.\nThe increased volatility encouraged investors to shed risky assets and commodities and to seek protection in so-called safe-haven assets. This helped hold up the gold market at times, but not enough to overcome the pressure from forecasts of higher rates.\nRising rates helped drive the U.S. Dollar to nearly a one-month high. This weakened dollar-denominated commodities like gold.\nForecast\nGold traders should continue to monitor the direction of Treasury yields and the U.S. Dollar. The stock market should also be watched closely.\nRising yields and the dollar should make gold a less-desirable asset. A recovery in the stock market could also press gold prices lower.\nTechnically, April Comex Gold futures are in a position to test a key retracement zone at $1306.60 to $1291.50. Trader reaction to this zone should determine the near-term direction of the market. Holding above $1306.60 will indicate the presence of buyers. A failure at this level will indicate the selling is getting stronger. This could trigger an acceleration to the downside with $1291.50 the next likely target. This level is another potential trigger point for a steep break.\nThe major U.S. reports this week that should influence the price action are consumer inflation, retail sales, producer inflation and building permits.\nOn February 14, traders will get the opportunity to react to the monthly CPI report. Consumer inflation is expected to rise 0.3%. Core CPI is expected to come in 0.2% higher.\nRetail Sales are expected to rise 0.5%. Core Retail Sales are called 0.2% higher.\nProducer Inflation (PPI) is expected to rise 0.4%. Building Permits are forecast at 1.31M, slightly above the previous 1.30M.\nStronger-than-expected consumer inflation will likely be bearish for gold prices because it will signal that inflation is rising and that the Fed may have to raise interest rates more aggressively this year.\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire",

Any mining stock, in theory, should be a leveraged bet on the underlying commodity.\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\nBut the problem with Barrick Gold stock is that the bet has rarely, if ever, paid off. ABX stock, to be blunt, has been a colossal failure. Its performance has been awful. Its executive compensation has ranged from excessive to obscene. And any investor buying ABX at the moment needs to understand that history \u2014 and believe that this time is different.\nAt the moment, that seems hugely optimistic.\nThe Disastrous Performance of Barrick Gold Stock\nAgain, the point of ABX stock is that it should provide upside leverage to increases in the gold price. Otherwise, investors could just buy gold, whether in physical form or through an ETF. And for Barrick, the performance should, in theory, be even better, given a substantial amount of leverage on the balance sheet.\nYet, over basically no period has Barrick Gold stock delivered that performance. Over the past year, gold has risen about 4%. ABX is down 29%. A three-year time horizon looks most beneficial, but Barrick Gold stock\u2019s gains of 7% still lag the 12% rise in gold. Gold is down 9% over the past five years; ABX has fallen further (29%). And over the past decade, a 45% rise in the price of gold contrasts with a 66% decline in ABX stock.\nPerhaps most incredibly, gold has better than tripled in the past 25 years. Barrick Gold stock has delivered negative total returns over that period. Only the most nimble, or most lucky, trader would have been better off with ABX than gold at most points during the past quarter-century.\nTo be fair, ABX isn\u2019t necessarily alone. The shares of what are now the five largest gold producers all have declined over the past decade \u2014 even while gold has risen. Newmont Mining Corp (NYSE:NEM) has been the best performer, dropping 4.5% (and providing positive returns if dividends are included). But ABX, Goldcorp Inc. (USA) (NYSE:GG), Kinross Gold Corporation (USA) (NYSE:KGC) and AngloGold Ashanti Limited (ADR) (NYSE:AU) all have fallen at least 60%.",

The uptick in exports ties in with stronger production and orders growth in May and confirms that the German recovery is not dead yet. Some will, however, warn that that the reliance on exports makes Germany particularly vulnerable to an escalation of the trade war, but also the fallout of a possible hard Brexit, although for now companies seem to be operation near capacity and are struggling with a shortage of skilled staff. Unadjusted data show an accumulated trade surplus of EUR 99.9 billion in the first five months of this year, little changed from the EUR 99.2 billion in the corresponding period last year. The current account surplus meanwhile widened to EUR 107.4 billion from EUR 98.7 billion.\nU.S. May trade deficit narrowed\nU.S. May trade deficit narrowed to -$43.1 billion from -$46.1 billion in April.

(\"Galane Gold\" or the \"Company\") (GG.V) is pleased to announce additional positive exploration results as the Company continues to delineate the extension of Tau at depth.(1)\nOn October 24, 2016, the Company issued a press release with regards to the structurally displaced mineralised zone referred to as the \u201cC Reef\u201d which represents a potential extension of Tau at depth. The C Reef mineralization characteristics are similar to those of the main Tau body; being a \u201cdisseminated style\u201f in well bedded, silicified quartz rich parts of the graphitic iron formation.

The current drilling has been focused on the wider eastern domain with intersections in the western domain of:\n- 24.85g/t over 3.0 meters; and\n- 11.99g/t over 1.26 meters.\nThe corrected drill hole intersection length of the 22 intersections on the western domain is 2.54 meters at an average grade of 5.04g/t over 120 meters on dip. The eastern domain has a corrected drill hole intersection length for the 9 intersections of 7.90 meters at an average grade of 2.68g/t over 120 meters on dip.(2)\nIn addition, further reviews of the historical data revealed that the C reef lithology associated with the wider eastern geological domain was intersected in two RC holes drilled in mid-2007 as part of the original Tau Deeps exploration program by the former owner IAMGOLD.(2) The lithology intersections were at a vertical depth of 360 meters below surface, equivalent to mining level 580RL; which is 80 vertical meters below the current deepest planned mining level at Tau. The assay results are missing from the database and the Company is currently reviewing alternatives to obtaining the results.\nBelow is a graphical representation of our current understanding of the C reef extension at depth. The exploration is continuing to further refine this view and add further life to the underground.(3)\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://resource.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/ee4bb40f-16f5-4a92-89d4-65cd20bbbe7b\nGalane Gold CEO, Nick Brodie commented: \"The decision to move to underground operations has been further supported as the exploration results continue to support our view on the extension of the Tau mineralized body at depth.(3) I believe we can now be more than confident in saying that Tau is expected to form the backbone of our operation past our current 4 year mine plan.\"(3)\nAbout Galane Gold\nGalane Gold is an un-hedged gold producer and explorer with mining operations and exploration tenements in Botswana and South Africa. Galane Gold is a public company and its shares are quoted on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol \u201cGG\u201d. Galane Gold\u2019s management team is comprised of senior mining professionals with extensive experience in managing mining and processing operations and large-scale exploration programmes. Galane Gold is committed to operating at world-class standards and is focused on the safety of its employees, respecting the environment, and contributing to the communities in which it operates.\nNotes:\n(1) The deposits on the Tau property are supported by a technical report in respect of the Mupane property entitled \"Independent Technical Report on the Mupane Gold Mine\" dated May 10, 2011 (the \u201cTechnical Report\u201d), a copy of which is available under the Company\u2019s profile on www.sedar.com. The potential extension of Tau has not been incorporated into the existing resource model found in the Technical Report. There has yet to be sufficient exploration on the potential expansion to extrapolate that it extends beyond the current mined area.\n(2) There has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target being delineated as a mineral resource.\n(3) The decision to commence underground production at the Tau property and the updated mine plan are based on internal reporting by the Company and not based on an independent feasibility study or pre-feasibility study of mineral reserves demonstrating economic and technical viability. While there is increased uncertainty and economic and technical risks associated with the Company\u2019s production decision to proceed without an independent feasibility study, the Company has been mining underground at the Tau property for the past two years, it carried out its own internal study based on its historic mining to support the new mine plan and, as a result, it believes it has sufficient knowledge to manage the risks associated with that decision.\nCautionary Notes\nCertain statements contained in this press release constitute \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d.

SVU and R.A Longstaff carried out the drill program under the supervision of Mupane\u2019s Site Senior Geologist. Drill hole locations were predetermined by the Site Senior Geologist and were laid out by the Site Surveyor. Final collar, azimuth and dip were determined by survey of the holes by the Site Surveyor.\nWhole core sampling was conducted in 0.5 meter intervals. All samples were bagged in sealed plastic bags which were sent for analysis at Mupane\u2019s laboratory. Sample preparation was as follows:\n- Oven dry samples at 110\u00b0C for a minimum of 6 hours and weigh;\n- Crush samples to nominal 4mm in laboratory jaw crusher;\n- Split sample using a Jones riffle splitter to obtain sample weight of approximately 800g;\n- Transfer coarse reject to sample packet and retain;\n- Clean pulverizer B1000 bowl with barren rock prior to initial sample pulverization;\n- Pulverize to 90% -75\u00b5m;\n- Clean B1000 bowl with barren rock after each 10th sample;\n- Scoop 500g of sample into sachet, discard remainder.\nAll samples were analyzed for gold by fire assay\n- Assays are conducted according to the Mupane method FA01 Determination of Au by 50g Fire Assay.\n- Product sizing is checked by randomly selecting 1 sample from every 20 and submitting for particle sizing using a 75\u00b5m (200 mesh) screen.\n- Second split \u201cSS\u201d duplicates are generated for every 10th sample and submitted for parallel analysis.\n- 2 CRM\u2019s are inserted into each 25-sample batch (1 low, 1 high grade) with 1 method blank placed at random and noted on the sample log sheet.\n- Pulp duplicates are submitted and compared against the initial sample. Results with variability greater than 5% are resubmitted for analysis.\nInformation of a technical and scientific nature that forms the basis of the disclosure in the press release has been approved by Kevin Crossling Pr.

The catalysts behind the selling were a stronger U.S. Dollar and stable demand for higher risk assets. Gold initially rallied at the start of the week on concerns of a global trade war and a weaker U.S. Dollar.\nJune Comex Gold futures settled the week at $1327.30, down $28.40 or -2.09%.\nThe U.S. Dollar rose against a basket of currencies, rebounding from a five-week low hit early last week, as trade tensions receded and the Greenback found support from month-end flows as global asset and fund managers rebalanced their portfolios.\nGold was also pressured by the news that North Korea\u2019s leader Kim Jong Un pledged his commitment to denuclearization and to meet U.S. officials, China said at mid-week after his meeting with President Xi Jinping, who promised China would uphold friendship with its isolated neighbor.\nForecast\nGiven last week\u2019s price action, the direction of the gold market this week is likely to be determined by the same factors \u2013 the dollar and global trade war concerns.\nAt the end of the week, gold was sitting in a weak position as concerns of a global trade war were eased by optimistic news that the U.S. and China were set to begin trade negotiations, after exchanging threats earlier in the month.\nTraders basically feel that any announcement that negotiations are being formalized and/or are being taken seriously by the U.S. and China would be considered bullish for the U.S. Dollar and bearish for gold prices.\nFurthermore, this news would also provide a platform for higher stocks or increased demand for risky assets which would also be a negative for gold prices.\nThe direction of the gold market boils down to appetite for risk. Gold will be an in demand safe haven asset if investors shed risky assets. On the other hand, investors will dump gold if the dollar and stocks become more attractive investments.\nThis is what is at risk if the U.S.-China attempt to reach a compromise fails. The tariffs on Chinese goods will likely be imposed in June after the government allows for public consultations and potential tariff revisions.\nIn the meantime, China could begin targeting a broad range of U.S. businesses from agriculture to aircraft, autos, semiconductors and even services if the trade conflict with the United States escalates.\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire",

Thornton, an ex-Goldman Sachs banker, will be executive chairman.\nBristow, a 59-year-old trained geologist, has been at the helm of Randgold since its inception in 1995 and is known for his straight-talking, hands-on approach to running the company.\n\"It brings to Barrick a good operator and free thinker in Bristow,\" said John Ing, president of Maison Placements Canada and a Barrick shareholder. \"It is very much a bet on the individual, the man - and what he has been able to do at Randgold.\"\nThe deal brings together two executives with different leadership styles and backgrounds.\nTwo-thirds of the directors of the board of the new Barrick will be nominated by Barrick and one-third by Randgold.\n\"POOR HAND\"\nThe deal value, at 48.5 pounds a share, matched Randgold's market capitalisation as of Friday's close. The lack of a premium for Randgold shareholders prompted scepticism from some analysts who were also concerned that Randgold's agility could be bogged down by the mammoth Barrick.",

Production cost of sales per Au oz. on a by-product basis2 was $644 in Q1 2018, compared with $686 in Q1 2017, based on Q1 2018 attributable gold sales of 654,451 ounces and attributable silver sales of 1,091,061 ounces.\nAll-in sustaining cost: All-in sustaining cost per Au eq. oz. sold2 decreased to a record low of $846 in Q1 2018, compared with $953 in Q1 2017. All-in sustaining cost per Au oz. sold on a by-product basis2 decreased to $835 in Q1 2018, compared with $945 in Q1 2017.\nRevenue: Revenue from metal sales increased 13% to $897.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with $796.1 million during the same period in 2017, due to an increase in gold equivalent ounces sold and a higher realized gold price.\nAverage realized gold price4: The average realized gold price in Q1 2018 increased to $1,330 per ounce, compared with $1,220 per ounce in Q1 2017.\nMargins: Kinross\u2019 attributable margin per Au eq. oz. sold5 was $672 per Au eq. oz. for the first quarter of 2018, compared with the Q1 2017 margin of $519 per Au eq. oz.\nOperating cash flow: Adjusted operating cash flow2 increased by 45% to $363.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $250.9 million for Q1 2017.\nNet operating cash flow was $293.5 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $207.8 million for Q1 2017.\nEarnings: Adjusted net earnings2,3 increased to $125.2 million, or $0.10 per share, for Q1 2018, compared with adjusted net earnings of $23.4 million, or $0.02 per share, for Q1 2017. The increase was mainly due to higher margins and a decrease in depreciation, depletion and amortization.\nReported net earnings3 was $106.1 million, or $0.09 per share, for Q1 2018, compared with earnings of $134.6 million, or $0.11 per share, in Q1 2017.\nCapital expenditures: Capital expenditures increased to $246.9 million for Q1 2018, compared with $178.9 million for the same period last year, mainly due to increased spending at Tasiast and Round Mountain, partially offset by lower spending at Fort Knox, Paracatu and Chirano.\nOperating results\nMine-by-mine summaries for 2018 first-quarter operating results may be found on pages eight and 12 of this news release. Highlights include the following:\nAmericas\nAt Fort Knox, production decreased compared with the previous quarter and year-over-year mainly due a decrease in grades. In addition, the lower production relative to Q4 2017 was due to the seasonal slowdown resulting in fewer ounces recovered from the heap leach. Cost of sales per ounce sold was significantly lower quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year primarily as a result of the timing of ounces processed through the mill. In late March, the Fort Knox pit experienced a minor pit wall slide, which, along with anticipated lower grades, are expected to have a slight impact on the mine\u2019s production and costs for the remainder of the year.\nAt Round Mountain, production was in line with the previous quarter and lower year-over-year mainly due to lower recoveries from the heap leach pad, partially offset by higher mill production due to an increase in mill grades and recoveries. Cost of sales per ounce sold was lower quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year mainly due to a decrease in operating waste mined and higher mill grades.\nBald Mountain continued its strong performance during the quarter. While production decreased compared with Q4 2017, mainly due to lower grades, it increased significantly year-over-year due to the timing of ounces recovered from the heap leach pads as more tonnes were placed on the pads in 2017. Cost of sales per ounce sold was largely in line versus last quarter and significantly lower year-over-year primarily due to lower operating waste mined and an increase in gold produced from the heap leach.\nParacatu performed well in Q1 2018, with production increasing significantly compared with the previous quarter due to the temporary curtailment of mining during Q4 2017 as a result of lower than average rainfall in the area. Production also increased compared with Q1 2017 primarily due to increases in ore processed, recoveries and timing of ounces processed through the mill. The higher production contributed to the lower cost of sales per ounce sold quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Lower contractor as well as favourable foreign exchange movements also led to the year-over-year decrease in cost of sales per ounce sold.\nAt Maricunga, gold production was better than expected, as rinsing of heap materials placed on the pads prior to the suspension of mining activities continued during the quarter. Cost of sales per ounce sold increased compared with Q4 2017 largely as a result of less ounces produced from the heap leach. Cost of sales per ounce sold increased compared with Q4 2017 mainly as a result of the timing of ounces recovered.\nRussia\nAt Kupol and Dvoinoye, production decreased compared with the previous quarter and Q1 2017 mainly as a result of the planned mining of lower grade ore. Grades are expected to remain at around this level for the remainder of the year. Cost of sales per ounce sold was largely in line with the previous quarter and increased compared with Q1 2017 mainly as a result of lower grades and unfavourable foreign exchange movements.\nWest Africa\nAt Tasiast, production was largely in line with the previous quarter and decreased year-over-year mainly as a result of lower mill grades. Cost of sales per ounce sold was largely in line compared with the previous quarter and higher compared with Q1 2017 mainly due to lower grades and an increase in operating waste mined.\nAt Chirano, production was slightly lower quarter-over-quarter mainly due to a decrease in grades and largely in line with Q1 2017. Cost of sales per ounce sold increased compared with Q4 2017 mainly due to lower grades, and decreased year-over-year primarily due to the completion of open pit mining in Q2 2017 and lower overhead.\nOrganic development projects and opportunities\nTasiast two-phased expansion\nThe Tasiast Phase One project is on schedule and on budget, and is now near completion and in the final stages of development. The plant remains on track to achieve a throughput capacity of 12,000 t/d by the end of June, with the mine also on track to achieve 2018 gold production estimates as contemplated in the project feasibility study.\nThe tailings storage facility, power supply upgrades and several ancillary facilities have been commissioned successfully and handed over to the operation team. The primary crusher is in advanced stages of commissioning and has been run at its design throughput. Construction is complete for the new components of the CIL plant, including the ball mill cyclones, additional leach tanks, elution circuit and intensive leach reactor. These new elements have been successfully tied into the existing mill, and commissioning is progressing well.\nThe SAG mill is 97% complete and while it is being commissioned, a by-pass circuit, using the new primary crusher and CIL plant in conjunction with the secondary crushers, is being ramped up on a temporary basis to achieve the 12,000 t/d throughput capacity and 2018 gold production estimates as contemplated in the feasibility study. During initial test runs in the past week, the plant reached throughput of 12,000 t/d. In addition, using the new primary crusher and existing crushers, a cumulative total of approximately 50,000 tonnes of ore have been pre-crushed and await processing through the CIL plant.\nClick here for video highlighting the Tasiast Phase One development: https://youtu.be/1oMQYTdw2iE\nAs previously disclosed, in 2017 a Mauritanian subsidiary of Kinross, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019Extraction de Tamaya S.A. (\u201cSETSA\u201d), filed an application to convert the Tasiast Sud exploration permit into an exploitation permit. This conversion is necessary to allow exploitation of Tasiast Sud. SETSA was recently informed by the Minister of Petroleum, Energy and Mines (\u201cMinister\u201d) that its conversion application has been rejected for failure to meet feasibility criteria. The Company disagrees with this decision and believes the decision lacks legal justification and that all requirements for conversion have been met. The Company requested reconsideration of the decision and has been negotiating with the Government of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania (\u201cGovernment\u201d) on this matter to find a mutually acceptable resolution.\nEarlier today, following a May 4, 2018 meeting with the Minister, SETSA received a letter from the Government reaffirming its earlier rejection of the Tasiast Sud conversion application and stating a desire to enter into mutually beneficial discussions with respect to all of the Company\u2019s activities in Mauritania. The Company understands the Government\u2019s position to be that any discussions are to be initiated by a proposal from Kinross that would provide greater overall economic benefits to the country. Kinross is currently assessing the situation, including the potential impact of the request on the Phase Two expansion.\nRound Mountain Phase W\nThe Round Mountain Phase W project continues to progress on schedule, with initial low grade Phase W ore expected to be encountered in mid-2019. Pre-grading of the heap leach pad has now commenced, along with earthworks in the new infrastructure area. The commissioning of two new electric rope shovels has been completed and stripping is progressing on schedule. Detailed engineering is now approximately 90% complete and procurement and contracting are well underway.\nBald Mountain Vantage Complex\nThe Bald Mountain Vantage Complex project is proceeding on schedule, with commissioning for the heap leach pad and processing facilities expected to commence in Q1 2019. Earthworks are well underway and engineering is now approximately 90% complete. The majority of procurement packages and construction contracts have been awarded and all major permits have now been received.\nRussia satellite deposits\nDevelopment of the Russian satellite deposits continues to progress well, with development of the twin declines at the Moroshka project continuing as planned. Mining of high grade ore at Moroshka, which is located approximately four kilometres east of Kupol, is expected to commence in the second half of the year. At the Dvoinoye Zone 1 deposit, which was added to estimated mineral reserve and resource estimates at year-end 2017, mine development has commenced, including earthworks and construction of the portal entrances.\nFort Knox Gilmore project\nAt the Fort Knox Gilmore project, feasibility study activities are progressing as planned and the Company is expected to announce results of the completed study in June. The feasibility study is contemplating a multi-phase layback of the Fort Knox pit and the construction of a new heap leach pad. Kinross gained mineral rights to the adjacent Gilmore land in December 2017, which resulted in a net 1.8 million ounce addition to measured and indicated resource estimates.\nLa Coipa Restart project\nThe Company is evaluating the potential for a return to long-term production in Chile, which includes the La Coipa Restart project and the Lobo Marte project, which is located approximately 80 kilometres from La Coipa. At the La Coipa Restart project, which includes the Phase 7 and Puren deposits, the Company completed the previously disclosed transaction to acquire the remaining 50% interest in the Phase 7 deposit on March 19, 2018. The Company now has the Phase 7 mining rights contemplated in the project PFS completed in 2015 and fully owns the Phase 7 deposit. A feasibility study is expected to be initiated for the La Coipa Restart at mid-year. Permitting has progressed, and the remaining two sectoral permits are expected in the second half of the year.\nThe Company also expects to initiate a scoping study for Lobo Marte at mid-year to assess the potential for a production start at the end of the La Coipa Restart mine life. Lobo Marte has more than 7 million Au oz. of estimated measured and indicated mineral resources with a grade of 1.2 g/t. The parallel studies are expected to determine the degree to which resources such as personnel, water, energy and capital equipment can be shared and leveraged for synergies and efficiencies between the two potential projects.\nBalance sheet and financial flexibility\nAs of March 31, 2018, Kinross had cash and cash equivalents of $997.9 million, compared with $1,025.8 million at December 31, 2017. The Company also had available credit of $1,566.5 million, for total liquidity of approximately $2.6 billion, and no debt maturities until 2021.\nDuring the first quarter, S&P Global Ratings upgraded Kinross\u2019 credit rating to investment grade, noting the Company\u2019s long track record of maintaining low leverage, along with its lower cash costs, strong liquidity and meaningful growth opportunities.\nWith Tasiast Phase One development nearing completion, the Company remains well positioned to fund its pipeline of promising development projects.\nOutlook\nThe following section of the news release represents forward-looking information and users are cautioned that actual results may vary. We refer to the risks and assumptions contained in the Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Information on page 18 of this news release.\nAs previously announced on February 14, 2018, Kinross expects to produce 2.5 million Au eq. oz. (+/- 5%) for the year, and be at or slightly above the same level of production for 2019 and 2020.\nThe Company expects production cost of sales per Au eq. oz. to be $730 (+/- 5%) and all-in sustaining cost to be $975 (+/- 5%) per ounce sold on both a gold equivalent and by-product basis for the year. Kinross expects production cost of sales per Au eq. oz. to decline slightly in 2019 and 2020 as lower cost production comes online.\nTotal capital expenditures are forecast to be approximately $1,075 million (+/- 5%) for the year, which include sustaining capital of $355 million and non-sustaining capital of approximately $680 million to advance the Company\u2019s development projects.\nAcquisition of power plants in Brazil\nOn February 14, 2018, Kinross Brasil Minera\u00e7\u00e3o, a subsidiary of the Company, signed an agreement to acquire two hydroelectric power plants in Brazil from a subsidiary of Gerdau SA for $257.0 million6. The two plants are expected to secure a long\u2010term supply of power and lower production costs over the life of the mine at Paracatu. The transaction has been approved by the Brazilian anti-trust regulatory authority and is expected to close in Q3 2018.\nConference call details\nIn connection with the release, Kinross will hold a conference call and audio webcast on Wednesday, May 9, 2018 at 7:45 a.m. ET. to discuss the results, followed by a question-and-answer session.

These measures are not defined under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation. The Company believes that these measures, together with measures determined in accordance with IFRS, provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the Company. The inclusion of these measures is meant to provide additional information and should not be used as a substitute for performance measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. These measures are not necessarily standard and therefore may not be comparable to other issuers.\nAdjusted net earnings attributable to common shareholders and adjusted net earnings per share are non-GAAP measures which determine the performance of the Company, excluding certain impacts which the Company believes are not reflective of the Company\u2019s underlying performance for the reporting period, such as the impact of foreign exchange gains and losses, reassessment of prior year taxes and/or taxes otherwise not related to the current period, impairment charges (reversals), gains and losses and other one-time costs related to acquisitions, dispositions and other transactions, and non-hedge derivative gains and losses. Although some of the items are recurring, the Company believes that they are not reflective of the underlying operating performance of its current business and are not necessarily indicative of future operating results. Management believes that these measures, which are used internally to assess performance and in planning and forecasting future operating results, provide investors with the ability to better evaluate underlying performance, particularly since the excluded items are typically not included in public guidance. However, adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share measures are not necessarily indicative of net earnings and earnings per share measures as determined under IFRS.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net earnings to adjusted net earnings for the periods presented:\n| Adjusted Net Earnings | |||||||\n| (in millions, except per share amounts) | Three months ended | ||||||\n| March 31, | |||||||\n| 2018 | 2017 | ||||||\n| Net earnings attributable to common shareholders - as reported | $ | 106.1 | $ | 134.6 | |||\n| Adjusting items: | |||||||\n| Foreign exchange (gains) losses | (0.5 | ) | 2.6 | ||||\n| Gains on sale of other assets | (0.8 | ) | (0.5 | ) | |||\n| Foreign exchange losses (gains) on translation of tax basis and foreign exchange on deferred income taxes within income tax expense | 0.2 | (4.4 | ) | ||||\n| Impairment reversal(a) | - | (97.0 | ) | ||||\n| Taxes in respect of prior years | 20.1 | 4.7 | |||||\n| Insurance recoveries | - | (17.5 | ) | ||||\n| Other(b) | 0.3 | (0.4 | ) | ||||\n| Tax effect of the above adjustments | (0.2 | ) | 1.3 | ||||\n| 19.1 | (111.2 | ) | |||||\n| Adjusted net earnings attributable to common shareholders | $ | 125.2 | $ | 23.4 | |||\n| Weighted average number of common shares outstanding - Basic | 1,247.5 | 1,245.6 | |||||\n| Adjusted net earnings per share | 0.10 | 0.02 | |||||\n| (a) | During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company recognized a reversal of impairment charges related to the disposal of its 25% interest in Cerro Casale. | ||||||\n| (b) | \"Other\" includes non-hedge derivatives losses (gains). |\nThe Company makes reference to a non-GAAP measure for adjusted operating cash flow. Adjusted operating cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations excluding certain impacts which the Company believes are not reflective of the Company\u2019s regular operating cash flow, and excluding changes in working capital. Working capital can be volatile due to numerous factors, including the timing of tax payments, and in the case of Kupol, a build-up of inventory due to transportation logistics. The Company uses adjusted operating cash flow internally as a measure of the underlying operating cash flow performance and future operating cash flow-generating capability of the Company. However, the adjusted operating cash flow measure is not necessarily indicative of net cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of adjusted operating cash flow for the periods presented:\n| Adjusted Operating Cash Flow | |||||||\n| (in millions) | Three months ended | ||||||\n| March 31, | |||||||\n| 2018 | 2017 | ||||||\n| Net cash flow provided from operating activities - as reported | $ | 293.5 | $ | 207.8 | |||\n| Adjusting items: | |||||||\n| Working capital changes: | |||||||\n| Accounts receivable and other assets | 2.4 | (50.2 | ) | ||||\n| Inventories | 23.0 | (5.7 | ) | ||||\n| Accounts payable and other liabilities, including taxes | 44.8 | 99.0 | |||||\n| 70.2 | 43.1 | ||||||\n| Adjusted operating cash flow | $ | 363.7 | $ | 250.9 | |||\nConsolidated production cost of sales per gold equivalent ounce sold is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as production cost of sales as per the consolidated financial statements divided by the total number of gold equivalent ounces sold. This measure converts the Company\u2019s non-gold production into gold equivalent ounces and credits it to total production.\nAttributable production cost of sales per gold equivalent ounce sold is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as attributable production cost of sales divided by the attributable number of gold equivalent ounces sold. This measure converts the Company\u2019s non-gold production into gold equivalent ounces and credits it to total production.\nManagement uses these measures to monitor and evaluate the performance of its operating properties. The following table presents a reconciliation of consolidated and attributable production cost of sales per equivalent ounce sold for the periods presented:\n| Consolidated and Attributable Production Cost of Sales Per Equivalent Ounce Sold | |||||||\n| (in millions, except ounces and production cost of sales per equivalent ounce) | Three months ended | ||||||\n| March 31, | |||||||\n| 2018 | 2017 | ||||||\n| Production cost of sales - as reported | $ | 444.6 | $ | 458.8 | |||\n| Less: portion attributable to Chirano non-controlling interest | (4.7 | ) | (5.8) | ||||\n| Attributable production cost of sales | $ | 439.9 | $ | 453.0 | |||\n| Gold equivalent ounces sold | 674,661 | 652,516 | |||||\n| Less: portion attributable to Chirano non-controlling interest | (6,444 | ) | (6,570 | ) | |||\n| Attributable gold equivalent ounces sold | 668,217 | 645,946 | |||||\n| Consolidated production cost of sales per equivalent ounce sold | $ | 659 | $ | 703 | |||\n| Attributable production cost of sales per equivalent ounce sold | $ | 658 | $ | 701 | |||\nAttributable production cost of sales per ounce sold on a by-product basis is a non-GAAP measure which calculates the Company\u2019s non-gold production as a credit against its per ounce production costs, rather than converting its non-gold production into gold equivalent ounces and crediting it to total production, as is the case in co-product accounting. Management believes that this measure provides investors with the ability to better evaluate Kinross\u2019 production cost of sales per ounce on a comparable basis with other major gold producers who routinely calculate their cost of sales per ounce using by-product accounting rather than co-product accounting.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of attributable production cost of sales per ounce sold on a by-product basis for the periods presented:\n| Attributable Production Cost of Sales Per Ounce Sold on a By- Product Basis | |||||||\n| (in millions, except ounces and production cost of sales per ounce) | Three months ended | ||||||\n| March 31, | |||||||\n| 2018 | 2017 | ||||||\n| Production cost of sales - as reported | $ | 444.6 | $ | 458.8 | |||\n| Less: portion attributable to Chirano non-controlling interest | (4.7 | ) | (5.8 | ) | |||\n| Less: attributable silver revenues | (18.3 | ) | (22.9 | ) | |||\n| Attributable production cost of sales net of silver by-product revenue | $ | 421.6 | $ | 430.1 | |||\n| Gold ounces sold | 660,884 | 633,806 | |||||\n| Less: portion attributable to Chirano non-controlling interest | (6,433 | ) | (6,557 | ) | |||\n| Attributable gold ounces sold | 654,451 | 627,249 | |||||\n| Attributable production cost of sales per ounce sold on a by-product basis | $ | 644 | $ | 686 | |||\nIn June 2013, the World Gold Council (\u201cWGC\u201d) published its guidelines for reporting all-in sustaining costs and all-in costs. The WGC is a market development organization for the gold industry and is an association whose membership comprises leading gold mining companies including Kinross. Although the WGC is not a mining industry regulatory organization, it worked closely with its member companies to develop these non-GAAP measures. Adoption of the all-in sustaining cost and all-in cost metrics is voluntary and not necessarily standard, and therefore, these measures presented by the Company may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. The Company believes that the all-in sustaining cost and all-in cost measures complement existing measures reported by Kinross.\nAll-in sustaining cost includes both operating and capital costs required to sustain gold production on an ongoing basis. The value of silver sold is deducted from the total production cost of sales as it is considered residual production. Sustaining operating costs represent expenditures incurred at current operations that are considered necessary to maintain current production. Sustaining capital represents capital expenditures at existing operations comprising mine development costs and ongoing replacement of mine equipment and other capital facilities, and does not include capital expenditures for major growth projects or enhancement capital for significant infrastructure improvements at existing operations.\nAll-in cost is comprised of all-in sustaining cost as well as operating expenditures incurred at locations with no current operation, or costs related to other non-sustaining activities, and capital expenditures for major growth projects or enhancement capital for significant infrastructure improvements at existing operations.\nAttributable all-in sustaining cost and all-in cost per ounce sold on a by-product basis are calculated by adjusting total production cost of sales, as reported on the consolidated statement of operations, as follows:\n| Attributable All-In Sustaining Cost and All-In Cost Per Ounce Sold on a By-Product Basis | |||||||\n| (in millions, except ounces and costs per ounce) | Three months ended | ||||||\n| March 31, | |||||||\n| 2018 | 2017 | ||||||\n| Production cost of sales - as reported | $ | 444.6 | $ | 458.8 | |||\n| Less: portion attributable to Chirano non-controlling interest(1) | (4.7 | ) | (5.8 | ) | |||\n| Less: attributable(2) silver revenues(3) | (18.3 | ) | (22.9 | ) | |||\n| Attributable(2) production cost of sales net of silver by-product revenue | $ | 421.6 | $ | 430.1 | |||\n| Adjusting items on an attributable(2) basis: | |||||||\n| General and administrative(4) | 35.7 | 35.2 | |||||\n| Other operating expense - sustaining(5) | 6.8 | 6.2 | |||||\n| Reclamation and remediation - sustaining(6) | 15.2 | 20.8 | |||||\n| Exploration and business development - sustaining(7) | 12.3 | 10.9 | |||||\n| Additions to property, plant and equipment - sustaining(8) | 55.1 | 89.7 | |||||\n| All-in Sustaining Cost on a by-product basis - attributable(2) | $ | 546.7 | $ | 592.9 | |||\n| Other operating expense - non-sustaining(5) | 8.1 | 6.5 | |||||\n| Reclamation and remediation - non-sustaining(6) | 1.3 | 1.6 | |||||\n| Exploration - non-sustaining(7) | 8.1 | 10.0 | |||||\n| Additions to property, plant and equipment - non-sustaining(8) | 171.5 | 79.5 | |||||\n| All-in Cost on a by-product basis - attributable(2) | $ | 735.7 | $ | 690.5 | |||\n| Gold ounces sold | 660,884 | 633,806 | |||||\n| Less: portion attributable to Chirano non-controlling interest(9) | (6,433 | ) | (6,557 | ) | |||\n| Attributable(2) gold ounces sold | 654,451 | 627,249 | |||||\n| Attributable(2) all-in sustaining cost per ounce sold on a by-product basis | $ | 835 | $ | 945 | |||\n| Attributable(2) all-in cost per ounce sold on a by-product basis | $ | 1,124 | $ | 1,101 | |||\nThe Company also assesses its all-in sustaining cost and all-in cost on a gold equivalent ounce basis.

Revenue from the sale of silver, which is produced as a by-product of the process used to produce gold, effectively reduces the cost of gold production. |\n| (4) | \u201cGeneral and administrative\u201d expenses is as reported on the consolidated statement of operations, net of certain severance expenses. General and administrative expenses are considered sustaining costs as they are required to be absorbed on a continuing basis for the effective operation and governance of the Company. |\n| (5) | \u201cOther operating expense \u2013 sustaining\u201d is calculated as \u201cOther operating expense\u201d as reported on the consolidated statement of operations, less other operating and reclamation and remediation expenses related to non-sustaining activities as well as other items not reflective of the underlying operating performance of our business. Other operating expenses are classified as either sustaining or non-sustaining based on the type and location of the expenditure incurred. The majority of other operating expenses that are incurred at existing operations are considered costs necessary to sustain operations, and are therefore classified as sustaining. Other operating expenses incurred at locations where there is no current operation or related to other non-sustaining activities are classified as non-sustaining. |\n| (6) | \u201cReclamation and remediation - sustaining\u201d is calculated as current period accretion related to reclamation and remediation obligations plus current period amortization of the corresponding reclamation and remediation assets, and is intended to reflect the periodic cost of reclamation and remediation for currently operating mines. Reclamation and remediation costs for development projects or closed mines are excluded from this amount and classified as non-sustaining. |\n| (7) | \u201cExploration and business development \u2013 sustaining\u201d is calculated as \u201cExploration and business development\u201d expenses as reported on the consolidated statement of operations, less non-sustaining exploration expenses. Exploration expenses are classified as either sustaining or non-sustaining based on a determination of the type and location of the exploration expenditure. Exploration expenditures within the footprint of operating mines are considered costs required to sustain current operations and so are included in sustaining costs. Exploration expenditures focused on new ore bodies near existing mines (i.e. brownfield), new exploration projects (i.e. greenfield) or for other generative exploration activity not linked to existing mining operations are classified as non-sustaining. Business development expenses are considered sustaining costs as they are required for general operations. |\n| (8) | \u201cAdditions to property, plant and equipment \u2013 sustaining\u201d represents the majority of capital expenditures at existing operations including capitalized exploration costs, capitalized stripping and underground mine development costs, ongoing replacement of mine equipment and other capital facilities and other capital expenditures and is calculated as total additions to property, plant and equipment (as reported on the consolidated statements of cash flows), less capitalized interest and non-sustaining capital. Non-sustaining capital represents capital expenditures for major growth projects as well as enhancement capital for significant infrastructure improvements at existing operations. Non-sustaining capital expenditures during the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily relate to projects at Tasiast and Round Mountain. |\n| (9) | \u201cPortion attributable to Chirano non-controlling interest\u201d represents the non-controlling interest (10%) in the ounces sold from the Chirano mine. |\n| (10) | \"Average realized gold price\" is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as gold metal sales divided by the total number of gold ounces sold. This measure is intended to enable Management to better understand the price realized in each reporting period. The realized price measure does not have any standardized definition under IFRS and should not be considered a substitute for measure of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. |\nCautionary statement on forward-looking information\nAll statements, other than statements of historical fact, contained or incorporated by reference in this news release including, but not limited to, any information as to the future financial or operating performance of Kinross, constitute \u2018\u2018forward-looking information\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018forward-looking statements\u2019\u2019 within the meaning of certain securities laws, including the provisions of the Securities Act (Ontario) and the provisions for \u2018\u2018safe harbor\u2019\u2019 under the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based on expectations, estimates and projections as of the date of this news release.

Known and unknown factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to: sanctions (any other similar restrictions or penalties) now or subsequently imposed, other actions taken, by, against, in respect of or otherwise impacting any jurisdiction in which the Company is domiciled or operates (including but not limited to the Russian Federation, Canada, the European Union and the United States), or any government or citizens of, persons or companies domiciled in, or the Company\u2019s business, operations or other activities in, any such jurisdiction; fluctuations in the currency markets; fluctuations in the spot and forward price of gold or certain other commodities (such as fuel and electricity); changes in the discount rates applied to calculate the present value of net future cash flows based on country-specific real weighted average cost of capital; changes in the market valuations of peer group gold producers and the Company, and the resulting impact on market price to net asset value multiples; changes in various market variables, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, gold or silver prices and lease rates, or global fuel prices, that could impact the mark-to-market value of outstanding derivative instruments and ongoing payments/receipts under any financial obligations; risks arising from holding derivative instruments (such as credit risk, market liquidity risk and mark-to-market risk); changes in national and local government legislation, taxation (including but not limited to income tax, advance income tax, stamp tax, withholding tax, capital tax, tariffs, value-added or sales tax, capital outflow tax, capital gains tax, windfall or windfall profits tax, royalty, excise tax, customs/import or export taxes/duties, asset taxes, asset transfer tax, property use or other real estate tax, together with any related fine, penalty, surcharge, or interest imposed in connection with such taxes), controls, policies and regulations; the security of personnel and assets; political or economic developments in Canada, the United States, Chile, Brazil, Russia, Mauritania, Ghana, or other countries in which Kinross does business or may carry on business; business opportunities that may be presented to, or pursued by, us; our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions and complete divestitures; operating or technical difficulties in connection with mining or development activities; employee relations; litigation or other claims against, or regulatory investigations and/or any enforcement actions or sanctions in respect of the Company (and/or its directors, officers, or employees) including, but not limited to, securities class action litigation in Canada and/or the United States, or any investigations, enforcement actions and/or sanctions under any applicable anti-corruption, international sanctions and/or anti-money laundering laws and regulations in Canada, the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction; the speculative nature of gold exploration and development including, but not limited to, the risks of obtaining necessary licenses and permits; diminishing quantities or grades of reserves; adverse changes in our credit rating; and contests over title to properties, particularly title to undeveloped properties. In addition, there are risks and hazards associated with the business of gold exploration, development and mining, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected formations, pressures, cave-ins, flooding and gold bullion losses (and the risk of inadequate insurance, or the inability to obtain insurance, to cover these risks). Many of these uncertainties and contingencies can directly or indirectly affect, and could cause, Kinross\u2019 actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, Kinross,including but not limited to resulting in an impairment charge on goodwill and/or assets.

Futures for the Nasdaq-100 index (NQM18.CME) gained 20 points, or 0.3%, to 6,840.75.\nThe moves come after a volatile session on Tuesday, when U.S. stocks managed to claw back losses from earlier in trading to close almost flat. During the session, Trump announced the U.S. was abandoning the 2015 Iran deal, which was forged by former President Barack Obama. The Dow industrials (^DJI) ended 2.89 points higher and the Nasdaq Composite Index (^IXIC) rose 1.69 points, but the S&P 500 (^GSPC) slipped 0.71 point.\nWhat is driving the market?\nA rally in oil prices helped lift U.S.-listed energy companies, which pushed stock-index futures higher. Initially on Tuesday, both West Texas Intermediate oil (CLM18.NYM), the U.S. benchmark, and Brent (IFEU:LCO=F) futures, the international benchmark, sold off after the Iran announcement. Trump said the U.S. intends to impose sanctions on Iran, curbing the country\u2019s oil exports and tightening global oil supply.\nTraders returned to the two benchmarks on Wednesday because fresh sanctions on Iran, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and a major oil producer, could mean disruptions in Middle East oil output\u2014a scenario that is bullish for oil prices.\nRead:Why oil prices didn\u2019t rally after Trump announced \u2018powerful\u2019 Iran sanctions\nWTI rallied 2.8% to $70.01 a barrel, and Brent jumped 2.8% to $76.92 on Wednesday. The jump also coincided with a rise in Treasury yields, as rising energy prices can lift inflation expectations, which are bearish for bonds that have a fixed value. Rising inflation also could put pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more aggressively. The yield on 10-year U.S. notes (XTUP:TMUBMUSD10Y=X) rose back above 3%. The dollar (IFUS:DX-Y.NYB) was higher earlier in the premarket session, but edged lower, off 0.1% at 93.04, as the opening bell approached.\nWhat are strategists saying?\n\u201cThe [Iran] decision is likely to curb global oil supplies and put upward pressure on oil prices. Iran is OPEC\u2019s third-largest producer, with production fluctuating around 3.8 million barrels a day [million barrels a day] in recent months and exports of between 2 and 2.5 mbpd,\u201d said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS, in a note.\n\u201cWe believe equity markets can withstand modestly higher oil prices. A boost to oil firms, which account for 7% of the MSCI All Country Index, should help offset the downside for other companies from higher input costs and the negative effects on consumer disposable incomes from higher fuel bills,\u201d Haefele added.\nStock movers\nAmong oil companies on the rise premarket, Exxon Mobil Corp.(XOM) added 1.5%, Chevron Corp.(CVX) climbed 1.1%, and Devon Energy Corp.(DVN) picked up 1.5%.\nWalmart Inc. shares (WMT) fell 1.5% in premarket trade after the retail giant said it was taking control of India\u2019s largest e-commerce company, Flipkart Group, for $16 billion, as the Bentonville, Ark.-based company tries to fend off Amazon.com Inc.

The online travel-booking service late Tuesday released results that topped Wall Street estimates.\nShares of Monster Beverage Corp.(MNST) sagged 6.8% ahead of the opening bell. The energy drinks company late Tuesday posted earnings below forecasts.\nWalt Disney Co.(DIS) dipped 0.3% in thin premarket trade even after its earnings out late Tuesday beat forecasts.

        "full_text": "* Shares in new company to be listed in New York, Toronto\n* GRAPHIC-Randgold, Barrick shrs vs gold: https://tmsnrt.rs/2OMaGAo (Adds quote from Barrick shareholder; updates Barrick share price)\nBy Zandi Shabalala, Justin George Varghese and Clara Denina\nLONDON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Canada's Barrick Gold Corp has agreed to buy Randgold Resources Ltd in an all-stock deal valuing the Africa-focused miner at $6.5 billion, to create the world's largest gold producer in an industry under investor pressure to put capital to good use.\nThe new Barrick company, which will be listed in New York and Toronto, will own five of the world's 10 lowest-cost gold mines and have a market value of $19.4 billion based on Monday's trading. That would make it the world's biggest gold miner by market capitalization, overtaking Newmont Mining Corp, according to Reuters calculations.\nThe deal marks the biggest transaction in years in the gold mining industry, where companies have come under fire from investors for poorly managing capital, forcing them to focus on costs while dampening enthusiasm for acquisitions.\nRandgold shares closed up 6 percent, making it the biggest gainer in London's wider mining index and valuing it at 4.93 billion pounds ($6.5 billion). Shares of Barrick, the world's second-largest gold producer, closed up 5.8 percent in Toronto.\n\"Randgold has the agility and swift-footedness of a younger and smaller company, much like Barrick in its early years, while Barrick has the infrastructure and global reach of a large corporate company,\" Barrick Chairman John Thornton said in a conference call.\nRandgold's long-term boss Mark Bristow will become the chief executive and president of the merged company, taking chief financial officer Graham Shuttleworth with him. Thornton, an ex-Goldman Sachs banker, will be executive chairman.\nBristow, a 59-year-old trained geologist, has been at the helm of Randgold since its inception in 1995 and is known for his straight-talking, hands-on approach to running the company.\n\"It brings to Barrick a good operator and free thinker in Bristow,\" said John Ing, president of Maison Placements Canada and a Barrick shareholder. \"It is very much a bet on the individual, the man - and what he has been able to do at Randgold.\"\nThe deal brings together two executives with different leadership styles and backgrounds.\nTwo-thirds of the directors of the board of the new Barrick will be nominated by Barrick and one-third by Randgold.\n\"POOR HAND\"\nThe deal value, at 48.5 pounds a share, matched Randgold's market capitalization as of Friday's close. The lack of a premium for Randgold shareholders prompted scepticism from some analysts who were also concerned that Randgold's agility could be bogged down by the mammoth Barrick.\n\"UK shareholders are arguably being dealt a poor hand with the merger,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. \"What Bristow has got to prove now is that bigger is better and the Randgold culture is the one that will perhaps prevail.\"\nThe current spot gold price is not helping the sector, having lost out on traditional safe-haven flows to the dollar, pushing it 10 percent lower this year.\nBoth Barrick and Randgold had lost a third of their market capitalisations over the past year before Monday's gains.\n\"We don't see a reason to change Randgold's approach. ... If we can't deliver something that is bigger and better, then we wouldn't do it,\" Bristow said on a call with analysts.\nBristow said on another call that the new company would be open to weighing options for its Nevada and Australia assets, and said there had been expressions of interest on the latter.\nThe new company will have the sector's highest adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and appreciation, an Ebitda margin of nearly 50 percent based on 2017 numbers, and the lowest total cash cost position among its peers, the companies said.\nUnder the terms of the deal, each Randgold shareholder will receive 6.1280 new Barrick shares for each share of the African rival, the companies said.\nTalks on the deal, which is subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals and scheduled to close in the first quarter of 2019, started more than three years ago with advisers taken in July, a person familiar with the talks told Reuters.\nIn 2017, Barrick and Randgold combined produced 6.64 million ounces while the next largest gold miner, Newmont, churned out 5.27 million ounces.\nThe two companies said they were aligned on their strategy with Chinese investors after Barrick said it would make a bigger push to attract investors in China.\nRandgold mines also in Mali, Ivory Coast and the Republic of Congo, where it has been faced with regulatory risk, a factor that Barrick's Africa unit Acacia Mining has to deal with in Tanzania.\nM. Klein & Co and Morgan Stanley advised Barrick on the deal, while CIBC and Barclays were the financial advisers to Randgold.\n(Reporting by Justin George Varghese in Bengaluru, Zandi Shabalala and Clara Denina in London; additional reporting by Noor Zainab Hussain and John Tilak; editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise, Marguerita Choy and Leslie Adler)",

The dollar slumped almost 10% in 2017, marking its worst performance since 2003, even though the dollar had started that year on a high, riding hopes that President Trump would implement pro-growth and pro-inflation measures.\nHowever, concerns about Trump's ability to push through those policies started to weigh on the greenback soon. Further, it lost steam as growth picked up outside the United States, with other countries' central banks moving toward tighter monetary policy, consequently narrowing the gap between the Federal Reserve and others. Moreover, tensions regarding North Korea and persistently low U.S. inflation led to the decline.\nDemand Dips in First Nine Months of 2017\nPer the data available from the World Gold Council, global gold demand declined 9% year over year to 915 tons in the third quarter of 2017 -- at par with levels last seen in the third quarter of 2009. In the first three quarters of 2017, demand for the yellow metal was down 12%. Let\u2019s have a detailed look at what led to the decline.\nJewelry Demand: Strength in China & United States, India Disappoints\nAfter recording growth in the first half of 2017, demand for jewelry dipped 3% year over year to 479 tons in the third quarter -- the weakest third quarter on record. Nonetheless, China witnessed a boost of 13% on festive buying after 10 consecutive quarters of decline. Moreover, the United States marked the strongest third quarter in the last five years, driven by economic growth, improving employment levels and growth in consumer confidence.\nNotably, India witnessed the main drag on jewelry demand in the quarter, declining 25% after three straight quarters of growth. The introduction of the 3% Goods and Services Tax (GST) at the beginning of July affected sales. In anticipation of the tax, customers had also moved their purchases to the second quarter.\nAdditionally, to make matters worse for the industry, the government brought the gems and jewelry industry under the purview of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (\u201cPMLA\u201d) in August. The Act required declaration of documentation for certain jewelry transactions. This deterred customers in rural India as they shied away from providing necessary documents. Further, inconsistent rainfall had its toll on gold jewelry buying in rural India, which is a major market.\nIn October, the India jewelry industry heaved a sigh of relief as the government removed the industry from the purview of the PMLA \u2014 a well-timed step, ahead of the festive season. As a result, consumer sentiment improved dramatically.\nTotal Investment Demand Suffers on Modest ETF Inflows\nTotal investment demand plunged 28% to 334.5 tons in the third quarter. ETF inflows were 18.9 tons, down from the record inflow levels of 144.3 tons in the prior-year quarter. In fact, the U.S.-North Korea imbroglio, along with its constant threat of nuclear conflict, had stoked the demand for gold investment for the first time.\nHowever, as it became clear in September that the Fed is likely to raise rates in December, investment in ETFs was affected. Also, stock markets at new highs led to the modest ETF inflows.\nMeanwhile, global bar and coin demand improved 17% year over year to 222.3 tons on the back of robust demand in China. Currently, the country is witnessing the second highest volume on record in 2017. The volume is being aided by fears related to potential depreciation of the yuan, concerns over rising inflation and lack of alternative investment opportunities.\nDemand from Central Bank, Technology Show Resilience\nCentral banks purchased 111 tons in the third quarter, up 25% year over year. This brought the total to 289.6 tons year to date, down 3% year over year. Russia, Turkey and Kazakhstan remained primary buyers. Demand for gold in technology improved 2% year over year to 84.2 tons in the third quarter, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of growth.\nSupply Growth Continues in the Red: Signal of Caution?\nTotal gold supply contracted by 2% to 1,146 tons in the third quarter. Recycled gold supply declined 6% year over year to 315.4 tons and mine production was down around 1% year over year to 841 tons. However, on a positive note, production in the first nine month period of 2017 was at a record high of 2,420 tons.\nProduction in China continued to decrease for five consecutive quarters due to stringent environmental regulations. In Tanzania, an ongoing dispute between the government and Acacia Mining led to a 15% fall in production.\nSector Level Earnings Trend\nPer the Zacks classification, the gold-mining industry comes under the broader Basic Materials sector. The sector\u2019s earnings rose 2.7% in the third quarter, a deceleration from growth of 7% witnessed in second-quarter 2017 and 13.5% in the first.\nHowever, the sector is likely to bounce back in the fourth quarter with an impressive 26.9% projection for earnings growth. Thereafter in 2018, the sector is expected to log growth of 18.9%, 14.8%, 8.7% and 5.6% in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2018 respectively. (For a detailed look at the earnings outlook for this sector and others, please read our Earnings Trends report.)\nIndustry Ranking - Positive\nThe Zacks Industry Rank relies on the same estimate revisions methodology that drives the Zacks Rank for stocks. The way to look at the complete list of industries is that, we put our X industries (all 265 of them) into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).\nIn the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1. Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry Rank\nWithin the Zacks Industry classification, the gold mining industry is grouped under the Basic Materials sector (one of 16 Zacks sectors). The gold mining industry occupies a space in the top half of the Zacks classified industries with a Rank of #104.\nAttractive Valuation, Upside Remains\nThe Gold Mining industry has advanced 5% compared with the S&P 500\u2019s growth of 22.8% in the past year. Going by the EV/EBITDA multiple (a preferred valuation metric for mining companies that have high capital expenditures), the gold mining industry has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA multiple of 7.65, much lower than the S&P 500\u2019s EV/EBITDA multiple of 12.33. The industry\u2019s lower-than-market positioning calls for some more upside in the quarters ahead.\nWhere Is the Industry Headed?\nPer the World Gold Council CEO, Aram Shishmanian, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about gold\u2019s performance in 2018. He noted \u201cU.S. interest rates may be rising but a lot is priced into the curve already and the direction of the dollar remains uncertain. Meanwhile, the long bull market in equities raises serious questions about prospects for stock prices.\u201d\nA number of new mines entered production in fourth-quarter 2017, which might support mine production till 2018. Noteworthy mines include The Natalka project in Russia, Canada\u2019s Rainy River project and Hound\u00e9 in Burkino Faso. However, in China, the largest producer since 2007, production will bear the impact of recently imposed regulations, which target the discharge of cyanide in tailings for few quarters.\nOn the demand side, major markets, India and its neighbor China will continue to be growth drivers. Last year, the Indian market had suffered a setback due to the impact of imposition of Good and Service Tax (\u201cGST\u201d) and anti-money laundering legislation (\u201cAML\u201d) around jewelry retail transactions. We expect it to bounce back as the market adapts to GST.\nPent-up demand as well as festive buying is anticipated to boost demand for jewelry in the country. Moreover, government measures like mandatory hallmarking in 2018, is likely to be a positive for the industry. In China, retail demand remains high around the Chinese New Year.\nMacroeconomic trends in Asia will support economic growth in the coming years. Given that gold demand is generally closely correlated to increasing wealth in the continent, gold demand will increase in tandem. In Asia, gold demand is mainly retail in nature, due to festival and wedding related buying activities in countries like India and China.\nFurther, the United States continues to be a strong market driven by economic growth, improving employment levels and growth in consumer confidence. Elsewhere, Germany\u2019s economy is expected to maintain momentum while unemployment is anticipated to continue declining, providing support for the world\u2019s third-largest bar and coin market.\nDemands from central banks also remain strong with Turkish and Russian central banks adding to their gold reserves. Further, gold is witnessing increased demand in technology, bolstered by demand for high-end smartphones after years of declines.\nIn the United States, even though there are positive expectations about President Trump\u2019s economic proposals, there are also concerns. Further, the United States-North Korea imbroglio has stoked the prices for gold. Mounting fears regarding what\u2019s next \u2014 negotiation or war \u2014 works in favor of gold which is considered a good store of value during political turmoil.\nWhile demand will remain strong, supply of this precious metal has already attained peak levels as per reports. Per the World Gold Council, the project pipeline will experience a small pick-up in 2018 before global mine production levels begin to decline in 2019. The combination of lower mined gold supply and higher demand could eventually propel the prices north.\nHow to Play the Industry\nSolid ranking, low valuation and earnings growth expectation makes a good investment case for the gold mining industry now. Investors can consider the following gold stocks that are backed by a solid Zacks Rank.\nBarrick Gold Corp. (ABX), Franco-Nevada Corp.

EMini futures for the S&P 500 also lost 0.4 percent in Asian trade, while European stocks opened down 0.6 percent.\nEuro zone bond yields rose sharply, tracking their U.S. counterpart, while the \"trans-Atlantic spread\" between United States and German 10-year bond yields hit a three-decade high of around 275 bps.\nGermany's 10-year bond yield, the benchmark for the region, hit a 4-1/2 month high of 0.55 percent before settling at around 0.53 percent, still up six basis points on the day.\n\"If the Fed is to hike rates beyond the neutral level, the underlying case is that the economy is doing very well - and if the U.S. economy is doing very well, that has spillover effects the euro zone,\" said DZ Bank analyst Rene Albrecht.\n\"This will make it easier for the ECB to raise rates in 2019; and you will see this impact yields in the euro zone, especially at the long end,\" he added.",

Shares of Barrick, the world's second-largest gold producer, closed up 5.8 percent in Toronto.\n\"Randgold has the agility and swift-footedness of a younger and smaller company, much like Barrick in its early years, while Barrick has the infrastructure and global reach of a large corporate company,\" Barrick Chairman John Thornton said in a conference call.\nRandgold's long-term boss Mark Bristow will become the chief executive and president of the merged company, taking chief financial officer Graham Shuttleworth with him.

The lack of a premium for Randgold shareholders prompted scepticism from some analysts who were also concerned that Randgold's agility could be bogged down by the mammoth Barrick.\n\"UK shareholders are arguably being dealt a poor hand with the merger,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. \"What Bristow has got to prove now is that bigger is better and the Randgold culture is the one that will perhaps prevail.\"\nThe current spot gold price (XAU=) is not helping the sector, having lost out on traditional safe-haven flows to the dollar, pushing it 10 percent lower this year. [GOL/]\nBoth Barrick and Randgold had lost a third of their market capitalisations over the past year before Monday's gains.\n\"We don't see a reason to change Randgold's approach. ... If we can't deliver something that is bigger and better, then we wouldn't do it,\" Bristow said on a call with analysts.\nBristow said on another call that the new company would be open to weighing options for its Nevada and Australia assets, and said there had been expressions of interest on the latter.\nThe new company will have the sector's highest adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and appreciation, an Ebitda margin of nearly 50 percent based on 2017 numbers, and the lowest total cash cost position among its peers, the companies said.\nUnder the terms of the deal, each Randgold shareholder will receive 6.1280 new Barrick shares for each share of the African rival, the companies said.\nTalks on the deal, which is subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals and scheduled to close in the first quarter of 2019, started more than three years ago with advisers taken in July, a person familiar with the talks told Reuters.\nIn 2017, Barrick and Randgold combined produced 6.64 million ounces while the next largest gold miner, Newmont, churned out 5.27 million ounces.\nThe two companies said they were aligned on their strategy with Chinese investors after Barrick said it would make a bigger push to attract investors in China.\nRandgold mines also in Mali, Ivory Coast and the Republic of Congo, where it has been faced with regulatory risk, a factor that Barrick's Africa unit Acacia Mining (ACAA.L) has to deal with in Tanzania.\nM. Klein & Co and Morgan Stanley advised Barrick on the deal, while CIBC and Barclays were the financial advisers to Randgold.\n(Reporting by Justin George Varghese in Bengaluru, Zandi Shabalala and Clara Denina in London; additional reporting by Noor Zainab Hussain and John Tilak; editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise, Marguerita Choy and Leslie Adler)",

Rising rates are a negative for gold.\nForecast\nOn Thursday, gold investors are likely to deal with much of the same.

Weekly unemployment claims are expected to come in at 239K. Consumer credit is forecast at 17.4B, down from 20.8B.\nThe daily chart indicates that gold is in a well-established downtrend. If the downside momentum continues, we could see a move into $1253.50. This is a possible trigger point for a further break into $1242.00.\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire",

This hole is particularly important, implying major system extensions northwest towards the Trivinio prospect;\n- Hole 39: Approximately 205m of copper sulphide mineralization (665-870m);\n- Hole 42: Approximately 602m of copper sulphide mineralization, including bornite, open at depth as drilling continues (309-911m); and\n- Hole 43: Approximately 205m of copper sulphide mineralization, including bornite, open at depth as drilling continues (665-870m).\n\u2022 Hole 37 (in progress) at Alpala Northwest intersects primary Bornite-Chalcopyrite-Magnetite assemblage, characteristic of the rich centre of many porphyry copper-gold systems.\n\u2022 Drilling costs more than halved from USD1,100 per metre to USD500 per metre.\n\u2022 Track mounted rigs exceeding production expectations allowing rig release and man-portable deployments to satellite targets.\n\u2022 Significant budget savings planned.\nFURTHER INFORMATION:\nCascabel is in northwestern Ecuador in an under-explored northern section of the Andean Copper Belt, 60 km northeast of the undeveloped inferred resource of 982 million tons at 0.89% Cu Llurimaga (formerly Junin) copper project2 (Figure 1).\nJV majority partner and project operator SolGold has drill tested 5 of 15 copper-gold targets delineated in the 50km2 concession with a focus, to date, on Alpala (Figure 2).\nOver 78,500m of drilling has been completed on the project. Currently, 12 drill holes are underway at Alpala (Figure 3).\nAssay results from the initial 53,616m of drilling were incorporated into the maiden Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) completed in December 2017 and announced on January 3rd 2018. All historical and current assay results have been provided to the Company by ALS Laboratories in Lima, Peru.\nThe Alpala drill program for 2018 comprises over 120,000m and will focus on expanding known resources at Alpala, with emphasis along west, northwest and southeast extensions as illustrated in Figure 4.\nImproved Rig Performances and Budget Savings Planned\nGreatly improved rig performance and core delivery especially by track mounted rigs at Alpala which are delivering up to 100m of core per day. This, with careful drill hole spacing and the use of Devi-drillTM and Navi-drillTM directional drilling tools, keeping the \u201ccore in the ore\u201d is likely to deliver significant budget savings and the permanent deployment of man portable rigs (Figure 5).\nUpdated Mineral Resource Estimate\nSolGold will update the MRE when sufficient information from drilling can be incorporated to affect a material change. This is expected in the next two months.\nMajor Northwest and Trivinio Extension\nHole 37 at Alpala Northwest has intersected a primary Bornite-Chalcopyrite-Magnetite assemblage, which is characteristic of the high-grade centres of many porphyry copper-gold systems. An example of bornite rich mineralization at 1666.5m down hole depth in Hole 37 is shown in Figure 6.\nFurther drilling in the highly prospective Alpala Northwest area is underway, and is considered a high-priority for the coming year as drilling progresses further northwest towards the Trivinio and Moran target areas.\nTrivinio Recent Geophysical Interpretation\nThe Company has recently completed geophysical interpretation across the Cascabel project area, integrating 3D models of Magneto Telluric Conductivity, Resistivity, Chargeability and Magnetics. This work has demonstrated that mineralization from Alpala North and Northwest may be continuous with the Trivinio and Moran Targets, which would extend the Alpala System northwards by approximately 1km.\nFigure 7 shows induced polarization (IP) chargeability survey areas and combined, normalized 3D IP chargeability across the Cascabel concession, delineating sulphide distribution and abundance between surface and 1000m depth at Alpala, and 1200m depth at Aguinaga, Tandayama and Trivinio.\nSolGold is planning to test Trivinio with two holes utilizing Rigs 7 and 8 following the completion of Holes 34 and 37 at Alpala.\nIn addition, the study has demonstrated the strong disseminated sulphide mineralization evident in chargeability models across the Cascabel concession. This, along with the multiplicity of targets and the growing resource in the Alpala sector, endorses the ongoing drilling focus there.\nAbout the Cascabel Joint Venture with SolGold:\nExploraciones Novomining S.A. (\u201cENSA\u201d), an Ecuadorean company owned by SolGold Plc and Cornerstone, holds 100% of the Cascabel concession. Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including SolGold\u2019s fully funding the project through to feasibility, SolGold Plc will own 85% of the equity of ENSA and Cornerstone will own the remaining 15% of ENSA. SolGold is funding 100% of the exploration at Cascabel and is the operator of the project. SolGold shall receive 90% of Cornerstone\u2019s distribution of earnings or dividends from ENSA to which Cornerstone would otherwise be entitled until such time as the amounts so received equal the aggregate amount of expenditures incurred by SolGold that would have otherwise been payable by Cornerstone, plus interest thereon from the dates such expenditures were incurred at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 2 per cent until such time as SolGold is fully reimbursed.\nLogging, sampling, assaying and reporting\nHoles referred to in this release were or are being drilled using HTW, NTW, NQ and BQ core sizes (respectively 7.1, 5.6, 4.8 and 3.7 cm diameter). Geotechnical measurements such as core recovery, fracturing, rock quality designations (RQD\u2019s), specific gravity and photographic logging are performed systematically prior to assaying. The core is logged, magnetic susceptibility measured and key alteration minerals identified by experienced loggers and sometimes using an on-site portable spectrometer. Core is then sawed in half at the ENSA core logging facility, and half of the core is delivered by ENSA employees for preparation at ALS Minerals Laboratories (ALS) sample preparation facility in Quito. Core samples are prepared crushing to 70% passing 2 mm (10 mesh), splitting 250 g and pulverizing to 85% passing 75 microns (200 mesh) (ALS code CRU-31, SPL21 and PUL-32). Prepared samples are then shipped to ALS in Lima, Peru where samples are assayed for a multi-element suite (ALS code ME-MSP61, 1g split, 4-acid digestion, ICP-MS finish). Over limit results for Ag (> 100 g/t) and Cu, (> 1%) are systematically re-assayed (ALS code Ag-AA62, 4-acid digestion, AAS finish). Gold is assayed using a 30 g split, Fire Assay (FA) and AA finish (ALS code Au-AA23).\nQuality assurance / Quality control (QA/QC)\nThe ALS Laboratory is a qualified assayer that performs and makes available internal assaying controls. Duplicates, certified blanks and standards are systematically used (1 control sample every 15-20 samples). Rejects, a 100 g pulp for each core sample and the remaining half-core are stored for future use and controls.\nQualified Person:\nYvan Crepeau, MBA, P.Geo., Cornerstone\u2019s Vice President, Exploration and a qualified person in accordance with National Instrument 43-101, is responsible for supervising the exploration program at the Cascabel project for Cornerstone and has reviewed and approved the information contained in this news release.\nAbout Cornerstone:\nCornerstone Capital Resources Inc. is a mineral exploration company with a diversified portfolio of projects in Ecuador and Chile, and a proven ability to identify, acquire and advance properties of merit.\nFurther information is available on Cornerstone\u2019s website: www.cornerstoneresources.com and on Twitter.

ABX, Franco-Nevada Corp. FNV, Sandstorm Gold SAND, Asanko Gold Inc. AKG and Pershing Gold Corp. PGLC.\nIndustry: Gold Mining\nLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/145288/gold-mining-stock-outlook---january-2018\nGold prices scaled a three-month high on the last trading day of 2017, its best yearly performance since 2010. Notably, spot gold has surged more than 12% last year -- its strongest gain since 2010. The performance is particularly noteworthy in a year when the Fed has been hiking rates and equity markets remained strong.\nThe bullish momentum has continued in 2018 so far, with gold currently trending above the psychological level of $1,300 an ounce. The rally can be attributed to weaker dollar and renewed safe-haven buying prompted by heightened geopolitical tensions.\nWeaker Dollar Aiding Gold\u2019s Cause\nGold is sensitive to dollar fluctuations. The dollar slumped almost 10% in 2017, marking its worst performance since 2003, even though the dollar had started that year on a high, riding hopes that President Trump would implement pro-growth and pro-inflation measures.\nHowever, concerns about Trump's ability to push through those policies started to weigh on the greenback soon. Further, it lost steam as growth picked up outside the United States, with other countries' central banks moving toward tighter monetary policy, consequently narrowing the gap between the Federal Reserve and others. Moreover, tensions regarding North Korea and persistently low U.S. inflation led to the decline.\nDemand Dips in First Nine Months of 2017\nPer the data available from the World Gold Council, global gold demand declined 9% year over year to 915 tons in the third quarter of 2017 -- at par with levels last seen in the third quarter of 2009. In the first three quarters of 2017, demand for the yellow metal was down 12%. Let\u2019s have a detailed look at what led to the decline.\nJewelry Demand: Strength in China & United States, India Disappoints\nAfter recording growth in the first half of 2017, demand for jewelry dipped 3% year over year to 479 tons in the third quarter -- the weakest third quarter on record. Nonetheless, China witnessed a boost of 13% on festive buying after 10 consecutive quarters of decline. Moreover, the United States marked the strongest third quarter in the last five years, driven by economic growth, improving employment levels and growth in consumer confidence.\nNotably, India witnessed the main drag on jewelry demand in the quarter, declining 25% after three straight quarters of growth. The introduction of the 3% Goods and Services Tax (GST) at the beginning of July affected sales. In anticipation of the tax, customers had also moved their purchases to the second quarter.\nAdditionally, to make matters worse for the industry, the government brought the gems and jewelry industry under the purview of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (\u201cPMLA\u201d) in August. The Act required declaration of documentation for certain jewelry transactions. This deterred customers in rural India as they shied away from providing necessary documents. Further, inconsistent rainfall had its toll on gold jewelry buying in rural India, which is a major market.\nIn October, the India jewelry industry heaved a sigh of relief as the government removed the industry from the purview of the PMLA \u2014 a well-timed step, ahead of the festive season. As a result, consumer sentiment improved dramatically.\nTotal Investment Demand Suffers on Modest ETF Inflows\nTotal investment demand plunged 28% to 334.5 tons in the third quarter. ETF inflows were 18.9 tons, down from the record inflow levels of 144.3 tons in the prior-year quarter. In fact, the U.S.-North Korea imbroglio, along with its constant threat of nuclear conflict, had stoked the demand for gold investment for the first time.\nHowever, as it became clear in September that the Fed is likely to raise rates in December, investment in ETFs was affected. Also, stock markets at new highs led to the modest ETF inflows.\nMeanwhile, global bar and coin demand improved 17% year over year to 222.3 tons on the back of robust demand in China. Currently, the country is witnessing the second highest volume on record in 2017. The volume is being aided by fears related to potential depreciation of the yuan, concerns over rising inflation and lack of alternative investment opportunities.\nDemand from Central Bank, Technology Show Resilience\nCentral banks purchased 111 tons in the third quarter, up 25% year over year. This brought the total to 289.6 tons year to date, down 3% year over year. Russia, Turkey and Kazakhstan remained primary buyers. Demand for gold in technology improved 2% year over year to 84.2 tons in the third quarter, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of growth.\nSupply Growth Continues in the Red: Signal of Caution?\nTotal gold supply contracted by 2% to 1,146 tons in the third quarter. Recycled gold supply declined 6% year over year to 315.4 tons and mine production was down around 1% year over year to 841 tons. However, on a positive note, production in the first nine month period of 2017 was at a record high of 2,420 tons.\nProduction in China continued to decrease for five consecutive quarters due to stringent environmental regulations. In Tanzania, an ongoing dispute between the government and Acacia Mining led to a 15% fall in production.\nSector Level Earnings Trend\nPer the Zacks classification, the gold-mining industry comes under the broader Basic Materials sector. The sector\u2019s earnings rose 2.7% in the third quarter, a deceleration from growth of 7% witnessed in second-quarter 2017 and 13.5% in the first.\nHowever, the sector is likely to bounce back in the fourth quarter with an impressive 26.9% projection for earnings growth. Thereafter in 2018, the sector is expected to log growth of 18.9%, 14.8%, 8.7% and 5.6% in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2018 respectively. (For a detailed look at the earnings outlook for this sector and others, please read our Earnings Trends report.)\nIndustry Ranking - Positive\nThe Zacks Industry Rank relies on the same estimate revisions methodology that drives the Zacks Rank for stocks. The way to look at the complete list of industries is that, we put our X industries (all 265 of them) into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).\nIn the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1. Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry Rank\nWithin the Zacks Industry classification, the gold mining industry is grouped under the Basic Materials sector (one of 16 Zacks sectors). The gold mining industry occupies a space in the top half of the Zacks classified industries with a Rank of #104.\nAttractive Valuation, Upside Remains\nThe Gold Mining industry has advanced 5% compared with the S&P 500\u2019s growth of 22.8% in the past year. Going by the EV/EBITDA multiple (a preferred valuation metric for mining companies that have high capital expenditures), the gold mining industry has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA multiple of 7.65, much lower than the S&P 500\u2019s EV/EBITDA multiple of 12.33. The industry\u2019s lower-than-market positioning calls for some more upside in the quarters ahead.\nWhere Is the Industry Headed?\nPer the World Gold Council CEO, Aram Shishmanian, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about gold\u2019s performance in 2018. He noted \u201cU.S. interest rates may be rising but a lot is priced into the curve already and the direction of the dollar remains uncertain. Meanwhile, the long bull market in equities raises serious questions about prospects for stock prices.\u201d\nA number of new mines entered production in fourth-quarter 2017, which might support mine production till 2018. Noteworthy mines include The Natalka project in Russia, Canada\u2019s Rainy River project and Hound\u00e9 in Burkino Faso. However, in China, the largest producer since 2007, production will bear the impact of recently imposed regulations, which target the discharge of cyanide in tailings for few quarters.\nOn the demand side, major markets, India and its neighbor China will continue to be growth drivers. Last year, the Indian market had suffered a setback due to the impact of imposition of Good and Service Tax (\u201cGST\u201d) and anti-money laundering legislation (\u201cAML\u201d) around jewelry retail transactions. We expect it to bounce back as the market adapts to GST.\nPent-up demand as well as festive buying is anticipated to boost demand for jewelry in the country. Moreover, government measures like mandatory hallmarking in 2018, is likely to be a positive for the industry. In China, retail demand remains high around the Chinese New Year.\nMacroeconomic trends in Asia will support economic growth in the coming years. Given that gold demand is generally closely correlated to increasing wealth in the continent, gold demand will increase in tandem. In Asia, gold demand is mainly retail in nature, due to festival and wedding related buying activities in countries like India and China.\nFurther, the United States continues to be a strong market driven by economic growth, improving employment levels and growth in consumer confidence. Elsewhere, Germany\u2019s economy is expected to maintain momentum while unemployment is anticipated to continue declining, providing support for the world\u2019s third-largest bar and coin market.\nDemands from central banks also remain strong with Turkish and Russian central banks adding to their gold reserves. Further, gold is witnessing increased demand in technology, bolstered by demand for high-end smartphones after years of declines.\nIn the United States, even though there are positive expectations about President Trump\u2019s economic proposals, there are also concerns. Further, the United States-North Korea imbroglio has stoked the prices for gold. Mounting fears regarding what\u2019s next \u2014 negotiation or war \u2014 works in favor of gold which is considered a good store of value during political turmoil.\nWhile demand will remain strong, supply of this precious metal has already attained peak levels as per reports. Per the World Gold Council, the project pipeline will experience a small pick-up in 2018 before global mine production levels begin to decline in 2019. The combination of lower mined gold supply and higher demand could eventually propel the prices north.\nHow to Play the Industry\nSolid ranking, low valuation and earnings growth expectation makes a good investment case for the gold mining industry now. Investors can consider the following gold stocks that are backed by a solid Zacks Rank.\nBarrick Gold Corp., Franco-Nevada Corp. and Sandstorm Gold carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and can be solid additions to your portfolio.

(AGI), Richmont Mines Inc. (RIC), Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX), Franco-Nevada Corp. (FNV) and Sandstorm Gold (SAND).\nIndustry: Gold Mining, Part 2\nLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/145507/gold-safe-investment-for-the-long-haul\nIn the current unstable financial climate, the need to reduce one\u2019s susceptibility against changing economic fortunes has become a top priority for investors. This is where the safe-haven appeal of gold becomes alluring and often becomes the cushion to fall back on. In contrast to more volatile stock market investments, gold has always been valued as a solid and dependable means to protect wealth.\nThere are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the gold mining industry for both the short and long term. Below, we have discussed what investors in the gold mining sector can look forward to in the coming months and years.\nIncreasing Wealth in Asia Will Continue to Fuel Demand\nIn the last decade, combined demand for gold from India and China has soared 71%. These two markets roughly account for 54% of consumer gold demand. Asia is now less economically dependent on the West and has shown relatively strong growth since the global financial crisis, despite persistently weak growth in the United States and Europe.\nIndia has a strong tradition of investing in gold, primarily in jewelry. Demand mostly increases around the wedding and festive seasons, which begin from mid-to-late August and continue until January. Expenditure on gold can account for almost 30% of the total wedding cost. This gives a boost to local currency demand and raises gold prices.\nIn China, people view gold, whether in the form of bars, coins or jewelry, as a natural medium for savings and diversification. Gold is embedded in China\u2019s culture, and the Chinese New Year and weddings are key events for the country\u2019s gold consumption. While China\u2019s middle class is expanding, India has a comparatively low level of per capita gold holdings. The powerful combination of increasing urbanization and strong cultural affinity for gold bodes well for the metal\u2019s demand in both these countries.\nIndia\u2019s gold industry suffered a setback last year due to the imposition of Goods and Services Tax (GST). The market will bounce back as it adapts to GST. Pent-up demand as well as festive buying is anticipated to bolster demand for jewelry in the country. Moreover, government measures like mandatory hallmarking in 2018, is likely to be a positive for the industry. Demand will grow year over year, given the insatiable appetite for gold and the rising wealth of Indian consumers.\nOverall, macroeconomic trends in Asia will support economic growth in the coming years. In Asian economies, gold demand is generally closely correlated to increasing wealth and consequently will continue to sustain demand in the years to come.\nU.S Markets Hold Promise\nThe United States delivered the strongest third quarter in the last five years, driven by economic growth, improving employment levels and growth in consumer confidence. Year to date, demand for jewelry has been up 4% to a seven-year high of 76.8 tons, consequently making the country the third largest jewelry market. Economic growth, improving employment levels and growth in consumer confidence will continue to sustain demand.\nDemand in Technology Returns to Favor\nTechnology demand was pegged at 84.2 tons in the third quarter, 2% higher year over year and marked the fourth consecutive quarter of growth. In the first three quarters of 2017, demand reached 244.4 tons, up 2% over the same period of 2016, returning to growth after six years of decline.\nLately demand for gold is increasing in electronics, from bonding wire to LEDs and Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs). LED demand continues to recover, showing improvement in the automotive sector, where LEDs are used extensively in sensor technology. New features, such as collision avoidance and intelligent sensing, depend on state-of-the-art sensor chips containing gold. Further, industry upgrade to Organic LED lighting given its versatility and energy saving benefits will boost gold demand and could help offset the switch to gold-free Chip Scale Packaging (CSP) seen in the sector.\nPCBs, which enjoyed positive spill-over benefits from strong smartphone shipments, continued to benefit from increasingly widespread adoption of wireless charging. The wireless sector remained strong on demand from leading smartphone manufacturers for new models.\nResearch continues on finding new uses of gold in applications. Researchers in the United States and China have developed a gold-based catalyst that could improve the performance and efficiency of hydrogen-powered cars.\nRevived Appetite for Acquisitions\nAmong other deals in the gold mining space, Alamos Gold Inc. and Richmont Mines Inc. entered into an agreement wherein the former will acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Richmont. With this, Alamos Gold has acquired a long-life, high-grade underground mine, Island Gold with growing production and first quartile cash costs in Ontario, Canada. Island Gold's near-term production growth complements Alamos Gold's existing peer-leading growth profile, while lowering the near and long-term cost profile of the combined company.\nGold\u2019s Safe Haven Appeal\nGold has always been viewed as a metal of great value and a safe-haven asset. The buying of gold is a hedge against inflation, macroeconomic, geopolitical, systemic and monetary risk. This trend intensifies during periods of economic turmoil and geopolitical tensions. The current economic scenario is rife with all these factors.\nSuperiority Over Other Precious Metals\nGold\u2019s worldwide acceptance as a medium of value sets it apart from other precious metals such as platinum, palladium and silver whose demand stems mainly from industrial applications. The yellow metal is produced primarily for accumulation while the other commodities are produced for consumption.\nMoreover, in contrast to other commodities, gold does not perish, tarnish or corrode, nor does it have quality grades. There has not been any material change in gold\u2019s quality over the years; gold mined thousands of years ago is the same as today. Gold existing above ground is easily interchanged with newly mined gold. This ensures the continuous demand of the metal for years to come.\nSome Good Picks from the Industry\nBarrick Gold Corp., Franco-Nevada Corp. and Sandstorm Gold carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and can be solid additions to your portfolio.\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nBarrick Gold has an expected earnings growth of 16.89% for 2018 and 11.01% for fiscal 2019.

Additionally, they may be getting a little nervous ahead of Tuesday\u2019s State of the Union address by President Trump, Wednesday\u2019s U.S. Federal Reserve Monetary Policy Statement and Friday\u2019s U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls report.\nI have no doubt that Trump will take the opportunity on Tuesday night to talk up the economy and the U.S. Dollar after last week\u2019s debacle. If you recall, last Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin trashed the dollar, fueling a deep plunge in the Greenback. Trump may have prevented another meltdown when he said he wanted a \u201cstronger dollar.\u201d He may come back on Tuesday with even stronger language supporting the dollar. This could trigger a massive rebound rally which should drive gold prices sharply lower.\nThe Fed is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged, however, if it delivers a hawkish message about inflation and the number of future rate hikes, gold could be pressured.\nFinally, investors will be watching for strong labor numbers in Friday\u2019s U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls report, especially the Average Hourly Earnings number since this indicates inflation.\nLater today, investors will get the opportunity to react to fresh economic data. The reports include the Core PCE Price Index, Personal Spending and Personal Income.\nCore PCE is a key inflation indicator. It is expected to come in at 0.2%, up from 0.1%. Personal Spending is expected to rise 0.5%, down from 0.6%. Personal Income is expected to come in unchanged at 0.3%.\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire",

The existing mining convention is being reviewed to accommodate this new investment.\nAlso at the briefing, Randgold chief executive Mark Bristow said the company's continuing investment in Mali had shown the way for others to follow, and the current development of new mines would bring additional production on line and increase the already considerable contribution the mining industry makes to the country's economy.\nGroup regional manager West Africa Mahamadou Samake also highlighted the importance of maintaining a fiscal and regulatory environment capable of attracting investment and re-investment in the mining sector.\n\"It is, therefore, imperative that the current mining code review is undertaken with this objective in mind, and any proposed changes should be made in light of the code's relative attractiveness compared to surrounding countries which are competing for the same exploration and investment dollars. This is particularly important in coping with the challenges inherent in developing and operating a mine in an infrastructurally challenged country like Mali, and the difficulty of finding replacement reserves. The government should focus on working with the industry to maintain Mali's position as one of the premier destinations for mining investment in West Africa,\" Samake said.\nBristow also appealed to Mali to consult with its neighbors in finding a cross-border solution to the growing problem of illegal mining. In some parts of Mali this was now out of control, he said, and the damage to property and resources, if it was allowed to continue, would discourage global investors.\nHe noted that Randgold and the Malian fiscal authorities were working together to resolve their outstanding tax and TVA issues.\nExcept for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this news release are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the US Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and applicable Canadian securities legislation.

(\"Sandstorm Gold Royalties\", \"Sandstorm\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE American: SAND, TSX: SSL) has released its results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2018 (all figures in U.S. dollars).\n- SECOND QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS\n- Revenue of $18.9 million (Q2 2017 - $16.1 million);\n- Attributable gold equivalent ounces1 sold of 14,465 ounces (Q2 2017 - 12,750 ounces);\n- Average cash cost per attributable gold equivalent ounce1 of $296 resulting in cash operating margins1 of $1,013 per ounce (Q2 2017 - $290 per ounce and $970 per ounce respectively);\n- Cash flows from operating activities, excluding changes in non-cash working capital1, of $12.3 million (Q2 2017 - $10.1 million);\n- Net income of $0.7 million (Q2 2017 - net loss of $1.9 million);\n- On June 26, 2018, the Company announced the results of the Hod Maden Pre-Feasibility Study. The PFS projects a pre-tax NPV (5% discount rate) of $1.4 billion and an IRR of 60%2. The study also outlines total production of more than 2.6 million gold equivalent ounces over an 11 year mine life and it is expected that gold will be produced at an all-in sustaining cost, on a co-product basis1, of less than $400 per ounce;\n- Sandstorm acquired 8 royalties on exploration-stage projects in Burkina Faso, Egypt and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. The Company now has 188 royalties in its portfolio.\n- OUTLOOK\nBased on the Company's existing royalties, attributable gold equivalent ounces sold is forecasted to be between 54,000 - 60,000 for 2018 and between 63,000 - 73,000 ounces in 2019. The Company is forecasting attributable gold equivalent production of 140,000 ounces in 2023.\n- FINANCIAL RESULTS\nSandstorm's revenue during the second quarter of 2018 was $2.9 million higher than the comparable period in 2017, driven by a 13% increase in the number of attributable gold equivalent ounces sold and a 4% increase in the average realized selling price per ounce of gold.\nNet income was higher when compared to the same period in 2017 partly due to certain non-recurring items that were recognized during the second quarter of 2017 including a $4.5 million non-cash impairment charge. The increase in net income was partially offset by a $1.1 million foreign exchange loss during the period.\n- STREAMS & ROYALTIES: Q2 UPDATES\nOf the gold equivalent ounces sold by Sandstorm, approximately 28% were attributable to mines located in Canada, 24% from the rest of North America and 48% from South America and other countries.\nThree months ended June 30, 2018\nRevenue (in $000s)\nGold Equivalent Ounces\nCanada\n$5,385\n4,131\nNorth America excl. Canada\n$4,463\n3,372\nSouth America & Other\n$9,085\n6,962\nTotal\n$18,933\n14,465\nCanada Streams and royalties on Canadian mines contributed 13% less gold equivalent ounces sold to Sandstorm when compared to the second quarter of 2017. The change is primarily attributable to a decrease in gold equivalent ounces sold attributable to the Ming mine in the Newfoundland and the Bachelor Lake mine in Quebec, offset by an increase in royalty revenue from the Bracemac-McLeod mine in Quebec.\nBlack Fox Stream\nMcEwen Mining Inc. (\"McEwen\") recently reported exploration results from their ongoing $15 million exploration program at the Black Fox Complex in Ontario, Canada. The goals of McEwen's 2018 exploration program are to grow known deposits and make new discoveries to contribute to near-term gold production.\nA significant portion of the drilling at Black Fox during the second quarter of 2018 focused on near mine exploration that could be brought into production quickly. A revised Black Fox Mineral Resource estimate was completed, which eliminated the Inferred resource category and increased the Indicated ounces and grade.\nFor more information refer to www.mcewenmining.com and see the press release dated July 25, 2018.\nSandstorm has a gold stream agreement to purchase 8% of the gold produced from Black Fox at an ongoing cost of US$540 per ounce.\nNorth America Excluding Canada When compared to the second quarter of 2017, gold equivalent ounces coming from North America, excluding Canada, increased by 8%. The change was driven by an increase in gold equivalent ounces sold attributable to the Santa Elena mine in Mexico.\nSouth America & Other Operations in South America and other countries contributed an additional 2,097 gold equivalent ounces sold when compared to the second quarter of 2017, representing a 43% increase. The newly acquired Hound\u00e9 royalty contributed 1,321 of those ounces.\nCerro Moro Silver Stream\nAt Cerro Moro, Yamana Gold Inc. (\"Yamana\") recently announced that their current exploration program is progressing towards increasing life of mine reserves and resources. Yamana expects that the successful drilling on the newly discovered Veronica vein, the Escondida Far East and Escondida Far West veins will lead to a measured and indicated mineral resource that will replace mining depletion from 2018 production.\nFor more information refer to www.yamana.com and see the press release dated May 2, 2018.\nBeginning in 2019, Sandstorm has a silver stream agreement to purchase an amount of silver from Cerro Moro equal to 20% of the silver produced, up to a maximum of 1.2 million ounces of silver annually, until Yamana has delivered to Sandstorm 7.0 million ounces of silver, then 9.0% of the silver produced thereafter for the life of the mine. Sandstorm will make ongoing payments for each ounce of silver received, equal to 30% of the spot price per ounce of silver.\nAurizona Royalty\nEquinox Gold Corp. (\"Equinox Gold\") announced that overall project construction is 60% complete at the Aurizona gold mine in Brazil. Pre-production mining activities commenced in mid-April and the mining contractor has removed more than 986,000 tonnes of waste. In mid-July Equinox Gold commenced stockpiling of ore to prepare for commissioning of the plant. Construction is proceeding on schedule to pour gold by the end of 2018.\nFor more information refer to www.equinoxgold.com and see the press release dated July 24, 2018.\nSandstorm has a 3% - 5% sliding scale NSR royalty on the Aurizona project. At gold prices less than or equal to US$1,500 per ounce, the royalty is a 3% NSR. In addition, Sandstorm holds a 2% NSR royalty on the Aurizona Greenfields property, a 190,073 hectare package of exploration ground adjacent to the Aurizona project.\n- WEBCAST & CONFERENCE CALL DETAILS\nA conference call will be held on Thursday, August 2, 2018 starting at 8:30am PDT to further discuss the second quarter results.

This measure is calculated by adding back the decrease or subtracting the increase in changes in non-cash working capital to or from cash provided by (used in) operating activities. The Company presents cash flows from operating activities excluding changes in non-cash working capital as it believes that certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance in comparison to other streaming companies in the precious metals mining industry that present results on a similar basis. With respect to the Hod Maden project, all-in sustaining cost per gold ounce on a co-product basis is calculated by removing the impact of other metals that are produced as a result of gold production and apportions the costs (operating costs, royalties, treatment and refining costs and sustaining capital) to each commodity produced on a percentage of revenue basis. These gold apportioned costs are then divided by the payable gold ounces produced. The Company presents all in sustaining cost per gold ounce on a co-product basis as it believes that certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance in comparison to other companies in the precious metals mining industry that present results on a similar basis. [(Operating Costs ($557.6 million) + Royalties ($131.4 million) + Treatment & Refining Costs ($164.9 million) + Sustaining Capital ($114.2 million)) x Gold Revenue ($2,586.4 million)/Total Revenue ($3,360.8 million)] / Payable Gold Ounces (1,990,000 oz) = $374 all in sustaining cost per ounce]. Sandstorm has included attributable gold equivalent ounces as a performance measure in this press release which does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).The Company's royalty and other commodity stream income is converted to an attributable gold equivalent ounce basis by dividing the royalty and other commodity stream income for that period by the average realized gold price per ounce from the Company's gold streams for the same respective period. These attributable gold equivalent ounces when combined with the gold ounces sold from the Company's gold streams equal total attributable gold equivalent ounces sold and may be subject to change. The presentation of this non-IFRS measure is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Other companies may calculate these non-IFRS measures differently. Note these figures have not been audited and are subject to change.\nNote 2\nAll figures are on a 100% project basis unless otherwise stated. Sandstorm has a 30% interest in the Hod Maden project.\nABOUT SANDSTORM GOLD ROYALTIES\nSandstorm is a gold royalty company that provides upfront financing to gold mining companies that are looking for capital and in return, receives the right to a percentage of the gold produced from a mine, for the life of the mine. Sandstorm has acquired a portfolio of 188 royalties, of which 20 of the underlying mines are producing.

Total operating cost is $12.87 per tonne processed\n- The base case economic estimate is an after tax net present value of $824 million, using a 8% discount rate, and an after-tax internal rate of return of 14.7% with a payback period of 4.6 years at metal prices of $3.30/lb copper and $1,300/oz gold\n- Drilling at depth demonstrates the continuation of mineralization below the bottom of the resource pit shell at similar grades\n- Existing infrastructure synergies between at La Arena and La Arena II include skilled workforce, power line, and roads\n(1) Please refer to \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" in this press release\n| Mineral Resources as of January 1, 2018 for the La Arena II project are summarized as follows: | ||||||\n| LA ARENA II MINERAL RESOURCES AS OF JANUARY 1, 2018 | ||||||\n| Material | Classification | Tonnes (M) | Gold (g/t) | Copper (%) | Gold (koz) | Copper (Mlbs) |\n| Oxide | Measured | 5.9 | 0.27 | - | 51 | - |\n| Indicated | 43.2 | 0.28 | - | 388 | - | |\n| Measured + Indicated | 49.1 | 0.28 | - | 440 | - | |\n| Inferred | 41.3 | 0.26 | - | 349 | - | |\n| Sulfide | Measured | 149.7 | 0.25 | 0.39 | 1,214 | 1,279 |\n| Indicated | 543.5 | 0.23 | 0.38 | 3,984 | 4,511 | |\n| Measured + Indicated | 693.2 | 0.23 | 0.38 | 5,197 | 5,790 | |\n| Inferred | 50.4 | 0.21 | 0.31 | 344 | 349 | |\n| (1) Totals may not sum due to rounding | ||||||\n| (2) Mineral Resources are reported within a $4.00/lb copper and $1,500/oz gold pit shell using cut-off grades of 0.10 g/t gold for oxide Mineral Resources and 0.18% copper-equivalent for sulfide Mineral Resources |\nThe 2018 La Arena II PEA supersedes the 2015 feasibility study. The prior feasibility study considered a small capital-constrained project with restrictive financial hurdles. The resulting Mineral Reserve estimate presented in the prior study represented only a small portion of the total Mineral Resources. Tahoe's PEA includes new exploration drilling results and re-evaluates the La Arena copper-gold porphyry project in the context of a long-term copper-gold project designed to world standards.\nThe prior study included Probable Mineral Reserves of 63.1 million tonnes at average grades of 0.43% copper and 0.31 g/t gold containing 579 million pounds of copper and 633 thousand ounces of gold. There are no Mineral Reserves reported in the 2018 PEA as the scope of the project has changed significantly with new exploration results, a refined geologic model, an updated Mineral Resource estimate, increased mining and processing rates, modified processing scheme, and the use of alternative tailings disposal facilities. While a portion of the data generated for the 2015 feasibility study provided support for some of the assumptions incorporated into the 2018 PEA, much of the mining, processing, geotechnical, hydrological, social, and capital and operating cost parameters used in the 2015 study are no longer applicable to the project as envisioned in the 2018 PEA.\nFor more information, please refer to the new NI 43-101 technical report for the La Arena property, Technical Report on the La Arena Project, Peru, which includes an update of the existing La Arena Mine oxide gold heap leach operation and a PEA of the La Arena II copper-gold porphyry project. The technical report is available on the Company's website at www.tahoeresources.com/operations/la-arena-mine/ and on SEDAR at www.sedar.com (and Edgar www.sec.gov).\nNI 43-101 required disclosure: Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. The La Arena II PEA is preliminary in nature and includes Inferred Mineral Resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA will be realized.\nAbout Tahoe Resources Inc.\nTahoe's strategy is to responsibly operate mines to world standards and to develop high quality precious metals assets in the Americas. Tahoe is a member of the S&P/TSX Composite and TSX Global Mining indices and the Russell 3000 on the NYSE. The Company is listed on the TSX as THO and on the NYSE as TAHO.\nTechnical Disclosure\nTechnical information in this press release has been approved by Charlie Muerhoff, Vice President Technical Services, Tahoe Resources Inc., a Qualified Person as defined by NI 43-101.\nMineral Resource estimates reported herein have been classified as Measured, Indicated or Inferred based on the confidence of the input data, geological interpretation and grade estimation parameters. Mineral Reserve estimates reported herein are based on known inputs that include metallurgical performance, taxation/royalty obligations, geologic and geotechnical characterization, operational costs, and other economic parameters. The company is not currently aware of any known factors that are reasonably likely to have a negative material impact on the Company's Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves. The Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates were prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 and classifications adopted by the CIM Council. Mineral Resources are inclusive of Mineral Reserves.\nThe basis of the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates for the La Arena mine and the Mineral Resource estimate for the La Arena II project is from Technical Report on the La Arena Project, Peru, dated February 20, 2018 with an effective date of January 1, 2018.\nFor further information, please contact:\nTahoe Resources Inc.\nAlexandra Barrows, Vice President Investor Relations\ninvestors@tahoeresources.com\nTel: 775-448-5812\nCAUTIONARY NOTE TO INVESTORS IN THE UNITED STATES REGARDING RESOURCES AND RESERVES\nThe Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates contained in this press release have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the securities laws in effect in Canada, which differ from the requirements of United States securities laws and use terms that are not recognized by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). Canadian reporting requirements for disclosure of mineral properties are governed by NI 43-101. The definitions used in NI 43-101 are incorporated by reference from the CIM Definition Standards adopted by CIM Council on May 10, 2014 (the \"CIM Definition Standards\"). U.S. reporting requirements are governed by the SEC Industry Guide 7 (\"Industry Guide 7\") under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These reporting standards have similar goals in terms of conveying an appropriate level of confidence in the disclosures being reported, but embody difference approaches and definitions. For example, the terms \"Mineral Reserve\", \"Proven Mineral Reserve\" and \"Probable Mineral Reserve\" are Canadian mining terms as defined in in NI 43-101, and these definitions differ from the definitions in Industry Guide 7. Under Industry Guide 7 standards, a \"final\" or \"bankable\" feasibility study is required to report reserves and the primary environmental analysis or report must be filed with the appropriate governmental authority. Further, under Industry Guide 7, mineralization may not be classified as \"reserve\" unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made.\nWhile the terms \"Mineral Resource\", \"Measured Mineral Resource\", \"Indicated Mineral Resource\" and \"Inferred Mineral Resource\" are defined in and required to be disclosed by NI 43-101, these terms are not defined terms under Industry Guide 7 and are normally not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC. United States readers are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into reserves. In addition, \"Inferred Mineral Resources\" have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence, and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. A significant amount of exploration must be completed in order to determine whether an Inferred Mineral Resource may be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian regulations, estimates of Inferred Mineral Resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases. United States readers are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an Inferred Mineral Resource exists or is economically or legally mineable. Disclosure of \"contained ounces\" in a resource is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations if such disclosure includes the grade or quality and the quantity for each category of Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve; however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute \"reserves\" by SEC standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures. Accordingly, information contained in this press release containing descriptions of the Tahoe's mineral deposits may not be comparable to similar information made public by United States companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements under the United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe Company has certain non-GAAP financial measures in this document which include total cash costs and total cash costs on a co-product basis. These measures are not defined under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation. The La Arena II project is expected to produce both gold and copper, neither of which comprises more than 80% of the revenues of the project. The Company believes that these measures may provide investors and analysts with useful information about the project and provide a meaningful comparison to other mining companies. Accordingly, these measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be substituted for GAAP measures. These non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently by other companies depending on the underlying accounting principles and policies applied.\nIn the La Arena II PEA and in this press release, total cash costs are presented on a co-product basis to remove the impact of by-product credits. Costs directly attributable to each metal (i.e. refining costs and heap leaching) are assigned to the metal. As per the La Arena II PEA, all other costs have been allocated based on the percentage of total revenue and are calculated based on the following assumptions for post commercial production costs and revenues as follows:\n| $ millions | Gold | Copper | Total |\n| Revenue | $ 3,869 | $ 13,854 | $ 17,723 |\n| % of Revenue | 22% | 78% | 100% |\n| Mining & Stockpile | $ 554 | $ 1,983 | $ 2,537 |\n| Concentrator | $ 734 | $ 2,628 | $ 3,362 |\n| General Administration | $ 128 | $ 458 | $ 586 |\n| Transportation | $ 140 | $ 500 | $ 639 |\n| Treatment Charges | $ 159 | $ 570 | $ 729 |\n| Gold Heap Leach | $ 54 | $ - | $ 54 |\n| Gold Refining | $ 18 | $ - | $ 18 |\n| Copper Refining | $ - | $ 378 | $ 378 |\n| Total Cash Cost | $ 1,786 | $ 6,516 | $ 8,302 |\n| Gold production (oz) | 2,976,173 | - | 2,976,173 |\n| Copper Production (lb) | - | 4,198,205,654 | 4,198,205,654 |\n| Co-product Total Cash Cost per Ounce / Pound | $ 600 | $ 1.55 | |\n| (1) Numbers may not calculate due to rounding. |\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT ON FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the US Exchange Act, the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, or in releases made by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, all as may be amended from time to time, and \"forward-looking information\" under the provisions of applicable Canadian securities legislation, concerning the business, operations and financial performance and condition of the Company.

SAND, IAMGOLD Corp. IAG and Kinross Gold Corp. KGC.\nIndustry: Gold Mining, Part 1\nLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/165079/gold-mining-stock-outlook---june-2018\nPer the data available from the World Gold Council, global demand for gold declined 7% year over year to 973.5 tons in the first quarter of 2018 \u2014 the weakest first quarter in 10 years. The weak performance can primarily be attributed to a fall in investment demand for gold bars and gold-backed ETFs, partly due to range-bound gold prices. Let\u2019s delve deeper and analyze the factors that led to the decline and also find out what is in store for the yellow metal.\nJewelry Demand \u2014 Robust in China & United States, India Disappoints\nDemand for jewelry dipped 1% year over year to 487.7 tons in the first quarter. Strong demand in China and the United States mitigated weak Indian markets. China witnessed a three-year high demand at 187.8 tons bolstered by jewelry sales themed around the Year of the Dog, which appealed to consumers buying during the Lunar New Year holiday as well as Valentine\u2019s Day sales. Moreover, the United States marked the strongest first-quarter since 2009, driven by economic growth, improving employment levels and growth in consumer confidence.\nNotably, India provided the main drag on the jewelry demand in the quarter, declining 12% as a depreciating rupee magnified the rise in the international gold price. Moreover, the lack of auspicious days led to lower sales in the quarter.\nTotal Investment Demand Suffers on Lower ETF Inflows\nTotal investment demand plunged 27% year over year to 394.2 tons in the first quarter of 2018. ETF inflows were 32.4 tons, down from 96 tons in the prior-year quarter. Notably, in the year-ago quarter, negative German yields reached a record low and gold prices gained 10%, which aided inflows. However, in the first quarter of 2018, relatively stable gold price and rising interest rates contrasted with sharp equity market volatility and heightened geopolitical tensions created mixed signals for gold investors.\nGold traded in a relatively steady range over the quarter, rising just 3% in US dollar terms. North American-listed ETFs were the only area of growth, adding 38.4 tons, which were negated by outflows elsewhere.\nMeanwhile, global bar and coin demand dropped 15% year over year to 298.2 tons due to range-bound gold price across most major markets.\nDemand from Central Bank, Technology Show Resilience\nCentral banks purchased 116.5 tons in the first quarter, surging 42% year over year reaching the highest first-quarter total in four years. Since 2010, central banks have bought an average 114.9 tons per quarter. Russia, Turkey and Kazakhstan remained consistent buyers and collectively account for nearly 50% of net purchases over the last five years.\nDemand for gold in technology improved 4% year over year to 82 tons in the first quarter, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of growth.\nSupply Growth Shows Slight Improvement\nTotal gold supply improved 3% to 1,032 tons in the first quarter. Recycled gold supply remained flat at 287 tons due to global uncertainty. Mine production inched up 1% year over year to 760 tons. Only Indonesia and Canada reported improvement in production, while it dipped elsewhere. Production in China continued to decrease for the sixth consecutive quarter due to stringent environmental regulations. Output from the world\u2019s largest producer slumped 8% year over year and it is likely to further decline throughout 2018.\nSector Level Earnings Trend\nPer the Zacks classification, the gold-mining industry comes under the broader Basic Materials sector. The sector\u2019s earnings rose 45% in the first quarter and in the rest of the quarters, it is expected to log growth of 46%, 37% and 15% in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2018 respectively. (For a detailed look at the earnings outlook for this sector and others, please read our Earnings Trends report.)\nZacks Industry Rank Reflects Ongoing Struggles\nThe Zacks Industry Rank #170 (of 250 plus groups) carried by the Gold-Mining Industry highlights the fact that industry is not currently in favor, as far as investors are concerned. This unfavorable rank places the industry within the bottom 34% slot of the Zacks industries.\nWe classify our entire 250-plus industries into two groups: the top half (i.e. industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (industries with the worst average Zacks Rank). Using a week\u2019s rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1 over the last decade. Click here to know more: About Zacks Industry Rank\nAttractive Valuation, Upside Remains\nStocks in the Gold Mining industry sector have been laggards, with the sector declining 6.2% underperforming the S&P 500 index\u2019s gain of 12.4% over the past year. Nevertheless, the valuation picture for the sector is attractive, highlighting a value-oriented path head.\nThe industry has a trailing 12-monthEV/EBITDA multiple (a preferred valuation metric for mining companies that have high capital expenditures), of 8.3 much lower than the S&P 500\u2019s EV/EBITDA multiple of 11.3. The industry\u2019s lower-than-market positioning calls for some more upside in the quarters ahead.\nWhere Is the Industry Headed?\nA number of new mines entered production in fourth-quarter 2017, which might support mine production till 2018. Noteworthy mines include The Natalka project in Russia, Canada\u2019s Rainy River project and Hound\u00e9 in Burkino Faso. However, production in China, the largest producer since 2007, will bear the impact of recently imposed regulations, targeting the discharge of cyanide in tailings for few quarters.\nOverall modest growth in global production is expected in 2018. While a small handful of greenfield projects are expected to command a portion of the rise in production, main growth will be driven by the expansion of existing mines and the ramp-up of recent projects. This trend may continue beyond 2018.\nIt has been observed that increasing cost pressures from currency movements and rising input costs combined with greater scrutiny from investors, is leading to miners focus on growing margins. Notably, mine production is now anticipated to improve at a moderate rate in contrast with decline expected earlier.\nOn the demand side, major markets, India and its neighbor China will continue to be growth drivers. Last year, the Indian market had suffered a setback due to the impact of imposition of Good and Service Tax (\u201cGST\u201d) and anti-money laundering legislation (\u201cAML\u201d) around jewelry retail transactions.\nWe expect it to bounce back as the market adapts to GST. Pent-up demand as well as festive buying is anticipated to boost demand for jewelry in the country. Moreover, government measures like mandatory hallmarking in 2018 is likely to be a positive for the industry. In China, retail demand remains high around the Chinese New Year.\nThe Indian government also announced measures to bolster rural incomes. This along with forecast for a normal monsoon bodes well the rural sector which is an important consumer for the gold industry.\nMacroeconomic trends in Asia will support economic growth in the coming years. Given that gold demand is generally closely correlated to increasing wealth in the continent, gold demand will increase in tandem. In Asia, gold demand is mainly retail in nature due to festival and wedding related buying activities in countries like India and China.\nFurther, the United States continues to be a strong market driven by economic growth, improving employment levels and growth in consumer confidence. Elsewhere, Germany\u2019s economy is expected to maintain momentum while unemployment is anticipated to continue declining, providing support for the world\u2019s third-largest bar and coin market.\nDemands from central banks also remain strong with Turkish and Russian central banks adding to their gold reserves. Further, gold is witnessing increased requirement in technology, bolstered by demand for high-end smartphones after years of declines.\nHow to Play the Industry\nEarnings growth expectation, attractive valuation makes a good investment case for the gold mining industry now. Investors can consider the following gold stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and have been witnessing estimate revision in earnings.

Click here to check it out.\n-\nThe intrinsic value of IAG\nThese data are very important to investors of Iamgold Corp. because they mean fresh nourishment for the operations of the company. Following the declaration of increased resources, Iamgold can extend the life of the mine for another five years to 2033. Over these 15 years of production, the mill facility will be supplied with an annual average throughput of 10.9 million tonnes of mineral to process.\nThe production will average 281,000 ounces of attributable gold every year over the span of 15 years according to the capacity rate of the plant. The miner forecasts a peak of 362,000 ounces in the annual production of attributable metal.\nOnce the satellite deposit of Saramacca has reached full production, the average annual production of attributable gold is expected to stand at 295,000 ounces. Saramacca should start mining gold in the second part of 2019.\nAnother important piece of information that usually is neglected by readers is that the increase in the mineral reserves was made without changing the assumption on gold price per ounce. The company still assumes a gold price of $1,200 per ounce of metal mined. It means that mining from those 1.6 million ounces of gold will not impinge the gold margin at least on the cost side.\nRosebel is a significant contributor to the total production of Iamgold Corp. The Surinamese mine is expected to end 2018 with 295,000 to 310,000 ounces of attributable gold, which is a 35% of total production including joint ventures. The other two main assets are in Canada and Burkina Faso.\nSteve Letwin, president and CEO of Iamgold, congratulated the exploration and engineering teams of the company for having moved the Saramacca satellite project rapidly towards the production stage.\nThe CEO highlighted the importance of the accomplishment considering that the replacement of mineral reserves is no longer easy to achieve in the gold mining industry nowadays.\nThe release is likely to produce a positive impact on the market value. Iamgold Corp. was $3.90 per share at close Friday, with a market capitalization of $1.81 billion on the New York Stock Exchange.",

For GDP, the Fed\u2019s March estimates incorporated the CBO scoring of the final tax law, though strong economic reports since then and upward revisions in market estimates should feed greater optimism at the Fed as well. GDP growth should be boosted of 0.1%-0.2% through 2018-19, but unchanged estimates for 2020. We also expect 0.1% boosts in the Fed\u2019s low-end 2018 headline and core PCE chain price estimates, with possible lifts in low-end 2019 figures, though many expect 2020 projections to remain the same. The high-end jobless rate estimates could be reduced by 0.1% across the board, given a stronger growth path for payrolls.\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\nMore From FXEMPIRE:\n-\nE-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM) Futures Analysis \u2013 June 11, 2018 Forecast\n-\nGold Price Futures (GC) Technical Analysis \u2013 June 11, 2018 Forecast\n-\nUS Dollar Index (DX) Futures Technical Analysis \u2013 Anticipating Sharp Break Under 93.19\n-\nNatural Gas Price Forecast \u2013 Warmer Weather Drives Prices Higher\n-\nUSD/CAD Price Forecast \u2013 USDCAD Holds Fort at 1.29 Handle As Trade War Woes Hit Post G7 Summit",

This will continue into January 2018\nCornerstone\u2019s Vice President, Exploration, Yvan Crepeau, said: \u201cThese new trenching results highlight the prospectivity of the Bramaderos property. They correlate well with historic drilling, adding the third dimension to the mineralized system mapped at surface and to our understanding of the shape and controls of the gold-copper mineralization. Hole CURI 03 drilled on the same section intersected open-ended mineralization (30.2m @ 0.8 g/t Au and 0.2% Cu) and has never been followed up. The trenching program is ongoing on the Main Target zone and is being extended to the Limon and Playas zones which have never been trenched or drill-tested.\u201d\nFurther Information:\nThe current trenching phase, with initial results reported here, is for three trenches; BM01, 02 and 03. Trenches BM02 and BM03 have recently been extended to the west and these additional results are expected in January (Figure 2).\nTrench BM02 has delivered 74.3m at 0.69g/t gold and 0.15% copper, including 51.1m at 0.81g/t gold and 0.18% copper.\nTrench BM02 was positioned over the top of historical diamond drill hole CURI-03 so that a cross section could be constructed to start to develop a better understanding of the 3-dimensional geometry of mineralization at Bramaderos Main.\nCURI-03 was drilled in 2001 by Ecuanor S.A. and intersected 248.1m at 0.56g/t gold and 0.14% copper from 9.14m to the end of hole. Mineralization at the end of the hole returned 0.93g/t gold and 0.22% copper over 2.2m (see Figure 3).\nThe trenching program is designed to map the porphyry gold-copper mineralization at surface. Trench locations were sited to cross areas of more intense quartz stockwork veining. They have successfully done that, and as a consequence, a phase 2 trenching program will be initiated with closer spaced trenches that will tighten up the definition of the mineralized zones. This will contribute to better defining drilling targets.\nAs stated previously, the trenching program delivers high quality continuous and non-biased samples, that can be considered equivalent to a drill hole sample. Consequently, the trenching data will be incorporated into future estimates of mineral resources. Channel sampling is done perpendicular to sheeted and stockwork quartz veining, controlling gold and copper mineralization.\nSee also:\nTable 1: 2017 Trenches at Bramaderos Main gold-copper porphyry target\nTable 2: Details of historical drill holes\nAbout Bramaderos\nThe Bramaderos concession is owned by Cornerstone subsidiary La Plata Minerales S.A. (\u201cPLAMIN\u201d), which has signed a binding letter of intent with Sunstone Metals Ltd. (formerly Avalon Minerals Ltd.) (STM.AX), whereby Sunstone has the right to earn a 51% interest in the project by spending US$3.4 million over 3 years to complete a phase 1 drill program. If this first option is earned, Sunstone can go to 70% by funding a bankable feasibility study, and can go to 80% by financing 100% of the cost of construction of a mine and mill (see news release 17-08 dated April 10, 2017).\nQualified Person:\nYvan Crepeau, MBA, P.Geo., Cornerstone\u2019s Vice President, Exploration and a qualified person in accordance with National Instrument 43-101, is responsible for supervising the exploration program at the Bramaderos project for Cornerstone and has reviewed and approved the information contained in this news release.\nSampling and assaying\nRock samples are collected by PLAMIN\u2019s personnel, placed in plastic bags, labeled and sealed, and stored in a secure place until delivery by PLAMIN employees to the LAC y Asociados ISO 9001-2008 certified sample preparation facility in Cuenca, Ecuador.\nRock samples are prepared crushing to 70% passing 2 mm (10 mesh), splitting 250 g and pulverizing to 85% passing 75 microns (200 mesh) (MSA code PRP-910). Prepared samples are then shipped to MS Analytical Services (MSA), an ISO 9001-2008 laboratory in Langley, BC, Canada, where samples are assayed for a multi-element suite (MSA code IMS-136, 15.0 g split, Aqua Regia digestion, ICP-AES/MS finish) and gold by Fire Assay (MSA code FAS-111, 30 g fusion, AAS finish). Over limit results for Cu (>1%) are systematically re-assayed (MSA code ICF-6Cu, 0.2 g, 4-acid digestion, ICP-AES finish). Gold is assayed using a 30 g split, Fire Assay (FA) and AAS finish (MSA code FAS 111). Over limit results for Au (>10 g/t) are systematically re-assayed (MSA code FAS-415, FA, 30g., gravimetric finish).\nSoil samples are dried at low temperature, screened to 80 mesh (MSA code PRP-757), a 15 grams portion is then assayed for a multi-elements suite (MSA code IMS-136, Aqua Regia digestion, ICP-AES/MS finish).\nQuality assurance / Quality control (QA/QC)\nThe MSA Analytical Laboratory is a qualified assayer that performs and makes available internal assaying controls. Duplicates, certified blanks and standards are systematically used (1 control sample every 20-25 samples) as part of PLAMIN\u2019s QA/QC program. Rejects, a 100 g pulp for each rock sample, are stored for future use and controls.\nAbout Cornerstone:\nCornerstone Capital Resources Inc. is a mineral exploration company with a diversified portfolio of projects in Ecuador and Chile, including the Cascabel gold-enriched copper porphyry joint venture in north west Ecuador.

After owning up to their overzealous expansion and acquisition spree of the early decade, gold miners have been fervently cutting costs by only focusing on projects with the highest ore grades, and minimizing exploration to only the most promising assets. The last five years have been all about paying down debt and aligning their operations to thrive in an environment where gold prices are considerably tamer. The result is an industry that could be considered a bargain today -- at least based on future cash flow per share.\nWhile earnings per share is the traditional measure of a company's success (and who doesn't like a healthy bottom-line profit?), my personal preference when analyzing and comparing gold stocks is to examine current or future cash flow per share. Though it's not a perfect metric -- for example, it tells me nothing about a company's debt or future cash flow potential -- it does offer insight into the amount of cash a company's operations are generating. This cash flow is critical to paying any interest expenses on debt, as well as to covering exploration and existing mine maintenance costs. In my view, cash flow per share is the heart and soul of the gold-mining industry.\nHaving been a bit of a gold stock maven for years, I've come to the determination that a price-to-cash flow per share of about 10 is considered fair. Any gold stock trading at more than 10 times its future cash flow per share is potentially pricey, while gold stocks well below 10 times next year's cash flow per share could be a bargain.\nCheap gold stocks worth a look\nWith this in mind, here are a handful of gold stocks that look to be screaming bargains based on their future cash flow per share.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nKinross Gold: 4.2 times next year's cash flow per share\nThough it's had a bit of tainted past, Kinross Gold(NYSE: KGC) might finally be ready to shake off its rust. Kinross Gold's issues derive from its acquisition of Red Back Mining, which owned the Mauritania-based Tasiast mine, for more than $7 billion in 2010. Essentially, Kinross acquired this mine at the peak of the gold-price craze. The end result was Kinross writing down about 80% of the value of the deal, as well as delaying the build-out of this prized mine.\nHowever, times are a-changing for Kinross, and a cluster of new projects are set to come online in the coming few years. In particular, the Tasiast phase one project remains on track for completion by the end of this month. Once finished, Tasiast will have boosted its throughput capacity to 12,000 tons per day. In doing so, Tasiast's output should grow by about 60% to 400,000 ounces of gold production annually, relative to the approximately 250,000 ounces per year it's currently generating.\nKinross also has plans to complete a massive phase two expansion at Tasiast that could practically double its annual production from where it'll soon be and crank up its throughput capacity to 30,000 tons per day. Such planning is still in the very early stages, but by the mid-2020s, Kinross could see a major uptick in annual gold production.\nMore importantly, with Tasiast's expansion imminent, as well as other projects remaining on track and within budget -- e.g., Round Mountain Phase W and the Bald Mountain Vantage Complex -- Kinross should see its all-in sustaining costs on a gold equivalent ounce basis fall over time. This means even more in cash flow for Kinross as time goes on. While I understand the leeriness of Wall Street to trust in Kinross Gold's management team, this has all the signs of a long-term turnaround in the making.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nYamana Gold: 4.3 times next year's cash flow per share\nSimilar to Kinross, Toronto-based Yamana Gold(NYSE: AUY) was a bit overzealous with its early-decade mine expansion, and even some of its mid-decade acquisitions. It wound up taking on quite a bit of debt and has been spending the last couple of years modestly paring down its debt levels to more manageable levels. However, the company now looks poised to benefit from bringing a number of new mines online in the years to come.\nIn addition to organic expansion at the company's Chapada and Canadian Malartic mines -- Canadian Malartic is jointly owned with Agnico-Eagle Mines -- Yamana is leaning on a number of new projects to do the heavy intermediate-term lifting. One such asset is the Cerro Moro mine, which entered commercial production in April of this year. Yamana anticipates that Cerro Moro will produce 85,000 ounces of gold and 3.75 million ounces of silver in 2018, with an average (full) year expected to generate 130,000 ounces of gold and 7 million ounces of silver.\nThe Suruca development within Aurora's prized Chapada mine is also expected to add icing onto the cake, so to speak. Beginning in 2019, the Suruca development could add 45,000 ounces of gold to 60,000 ounces of gold for up to a five-year period. These projects have been pivotal in pushing Yamana Gold's mineral resource estimates higher.\nBecause of Yamana's silver and copper production, its byproduct-included all-in sustaining costs are lower than the industry average. When coupled with a well-below-average multiple of 4.3 times next year's cash flow per share, Yamana Gold appears to offer excellent value.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nGoldcorp: 6.7 times next year's cash flow per share\nA third and final gold stock that appears to offer exceptional value is Goldcorp(NYSE: GG). Like the other gold miners listed above, Goldcorp's debt became a source of concern as gold prices declined into 2015, but the company has made modest headway on reducing its debt over the last two-plus years. With a number of projects and cost-cutting initiatives ongoing, Goldcorp is beginning to look like a great deal.\nKey to Goldcorp's success is what it refers to as its \"20/20/20 strategy.\" This entails the company growing its production by 20%, reducing its all-in sustaining costs by 20%, and increasing its asset reserves by 20%, all by 2020. In terms of growth, the company is continuing to ramp up its Cerro Negro and Eleonore mines, while nearing completion on its Pyrite Leach project at Penasquito. Notably, this latter project is ahead of schedule, with other developments at Musselwhite and Borden coming in at or below cost.\nThis is a good time to point out that Goldcorp has traditionally leaned on byproduct production to help lower its all-in sustaining costs. By also ramping up Cerro Negro and Eleonore, and improving the production efficiency at existing mines, it should be able to push its all-in sustaining costs to perhaps $700 per gold ounce by 2020. In fact, after initially targeting $250 million in annual efficiency savings, the company believes this figure could be too conservative.\nThe bottom line with Goldcorp is that it's always been at or near the top of the pack in terms of low production costs. With steady production growth and cost-cutting forecast through 2020, it's not out of the question that Goldcorp could outperform the broader market.\nSean Williams has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Trump told CNBC in an interview in Davos, Switzerland, that he ultimately wants the dollar to be strong.\nThis statement was enough to spook the short-sellers and encourage aggressive short-covering initially, however, the move didn\u2019t last with gold making an almost full recovery from its previous day\u2019s sell-off to close at nearly its highest level for the week.\nForecast\nThe price action this week will once again be controlled by the direction of the U.S. Dollar. The dollar will be largely influenced by President Trump\u2019s State of the Union speech on Tuesday, January 30 at 9:00 Eastern (0200 GMT Wednesday). Once again, a weaker dollar will be bullish for gold and a stronger dollar bearish for gold.\nTraders should expect Trump to talk about the positives in the economy. This may trigger a strong recovery in the dollar, at least over the short-run. This would be bearish for gold.\nThe Fed will issue its monetary policy statement on January 31. The central bank is not expected to raise interest rates. Traders will be looking for the Fed\u2019s assessment of the economy, inflation and its outlook for future rate hikes.\nFinally, investors will also get the opportunity to react to the latest data on employment in Friday\u2019s U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls report. The headline number is expected to show the economy added 184K jobs in January, up from 148K in December. Average Hourly Earnings are expected to increase 0.3% and the Unemployment Rate is expected to remain at 4.1%.",

The dip in exports ties in with weak orders numbers, but may also be a reflection of weather related disruptions and supply shortages as Eurozone as well as U.K. manufacturing PMIs reported lengthened delivery times partly due to material shortages.

Each project is benchmarked against a 15 percent hurdle rate using a long-term gold price assumption of $1,200 per ounce and ranked accordingly.\nIn addition, Barrick provided an update on leadership changes within the Company\u2019s Operations group.\nPlease visit www.barrick.com today at 2 p.m. Eastern Time for a webcast and presentations covering 2018 strategic priorities, financial review, investment criteria, operations, projects, exploration, reserves and resources, innovation, and sustainability performance and priorities.\nMAXIMIZING VALUE FROM A SUSTAINABLE, LONG-TERM PRODUCTION PROFILE\nBased on our current asset mix, between 2019 and 2022, we continue to expect average annual gold production to be between 4.2-4.6 million ounces, at an average cost of sales1 of $850-$980 per ounce, and average all-in sustaining costs2 of $750-$875 per ounce. Between 2023 and 2027, our current plans indicate the potential for average annual gold production above four million ounces. This includes contributions from projects at Cortez Deep South, Goldrush, Lagunas Norte, Robertson, Pueblo Viejo and Turquoise Ridge. It does not include any contributions from Alturas, Donlin Gold, Norte Abierto (50 percent interest), or Pascua-Lama, which represent substantial long-term optionality over our production base case. In the near term, we aim to strengthen our production profile through disciplined investment in our brownfield projects and mine exploration drilling, supporting reserve replacement and the identification of new resources which, in many cases, can be quickly incorporated into mine plans, driving improvements in production and cash flow.\nOur core gold business is complemented by a substantial portfolio of copper assets, representing an additional source of cash flow and value. Barrick has 11.2 billion pounds3 of proven and probable copper reserves (including copper within proven and probable gold reserves), and 11.7 billion pounds3 of measured and indicated copper resources (including copper within measured and indicated gold resources). Our three copper mines\u2014Jabal Sayid (50 percent interest), Lumwana, and Zaldivar (50 percent interest)\u2014are located in some of the world\u2019s most attractive and prospective copper districts. We continue to expect our portfolio to produce 385-450 million pounds of copper in 2018, at a cost of sales1 of $1.80-$2.10 per pound, and all-in sustaining costs4 of $2.30-$2.60 per pound.\nOperational Leadership Transition\nOver the past two and a half years, Richard Williams has led the transformation of Barrick\u2019s operating system, delivering significant improvements in safety, environmental management, and operating efficiency. He drove the implementation of our decentralized operating model, underpinned by the Business Plan Review, our Best-in-Class Optimization Processes, and Crisis Management systems. During this period, he was also responsible for the reinvigoration of our innovation process, the initial phases of our digital transformation, and the start-up of our integrated supply chain and maintenance system.\nConcurrent with this, Mr. Williams has also been leading ongoing discussions with the Government of Tanzania that aim to resolve outstanding issues facing Acacia Mining plc. This is a matter of strategic importance to Barrick. In order to ensure those discussions are concluded expeditiously, Mr. Williams is taking on a new role as the Chairman\u2019s Executive Envoy to Tanzania, and will focus exclusively on this challenge.\nIn keeping with our increased emphasis on operational improvement and technical excellence, we are assigning responsibility for Barrick\u2019s Operations group to Greg Walker, Senior Vice President, Operational and Technical Excellence. Mr. Walker is a seasoned operational leader with 30 years of international mining industry experience. He has a proven track record of delivering business improvement, with an emphasis on disciplined execution. Mr. Walker joined Barrick in 2003 and has held a series of senior operational leadership roles in complex and challenging environments, including General Manager of the Bulyanhulu and Tulawaka mines in Tanzania, and Executive General Manager of the Porgera Joint Venture in Papua New Guinea. He was most recently Executive General Manager of the Pueblo Viejo mine in the Dominican Republic.\nPROJECTS IN EXECUTION\nTurquoise Ridge Expansion, Nevada, U.S.A. (75 percent Barrick / 25 percent Newmont)\nProject Overview: Double annual production through construction of a third shaft.\nThe construction of a third shaft at Turquoise Ridge, with an estimated initial capital investment of $300-$325 million (100 percent basis) has been approved by the Company. Combined with additional processing capacity, this is expected to enable the mine to roughly double annual production to more than 500,000 ounces per year (100 percent basis), at an average cost of sales1 of around $720 per ounce, and average all-in sustaining costs2 of roughly $630 per ounce. In addition to increasing annual production, the third shaft is expected to reduce operating costs, boost mining productivity rates, and increase total life of mine production by allowing for reduced cutoff grades. In January 2017, Barrick and Newmont Mining Corporation (\"Newmont\") reached a new, seven-year toll milling agreement for ore processing at Newmont\u2019s Twin Creeks facility, which will support the mine expansion. The agreement increases contractual annual throughput from 730,000 tons in 2017, to 850,000 tons in 2018 and 2019, and 1.2 million tons per year between 2020 and 2024.\nPermits for the construction of a third shaft are in hand. Surface works and shaft sinking are expected to take place in 2018 and 2019, followed by equipping of the shaft in 2020 and 2021, with initial production from the new shaft expected to begin in 2022, and sustained production expected to begin 2023.\nBarrick is designating Turquoise Ridge as a core mine in recognition of the exceptional growth potential of the operation, which will be facilitated by the construction of a third shaft, productivity improvements, and an expansion of processing capacity, as noted above. Located in the heart of northern Nevada\u2014one of the world\u2019s premier jurisdictions for gold mining\u2014Turquoise Ridge has 5.9 million ounces3 of proven and probable gold reserves (Barrick\u2019s 75 percent share) at an average grade of 15.56 grams per tonne\u2014the highest reserve grade in the Company\u2019s operating portfolio, and among the highest in the gold industry. The mine added 2.1 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves in 2017 through drilling (Barrick\u2019s 75 percent share), and the deposit remains open in multiple directions, including at depth. We are confident that Turquoise Ridge has significant potential to add additional resources in the future, as the third shaft opens up access to new areas of the deposit, in particular the North zone, where 80 percent of existing proven and probable reserves are located.\nCortez Deep South, Nevada, U.S.A.\nProject Overview: Expand mining into the Deep South area below currently permitted levels of the Cortez Hills underground mine, bringing forward production.\nThe Deep South project will utilize infrastructure which has already been approved under current plans to expand mining in the Lower Zone of the Cortez underground mine, including the new Rangefront twin declines and other underground infrastructure already under construction.\nPermitting for Deep South was initiated in 2016 with the submission of an amendment to the current Mine Plan of Operations to the Bureau of Land Management, and is expected to take approximately three to four years, including the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement. A record of decision is expected in the second half of 2019, followed by two years of construction, with initial production from Deep South in 2022.\n| Prefeasibility | Feasibility (2017) | |\n| Internal approval status | Under review | Approved |\n| Mining method(s) | Longhole stoping | Longhole stoping |\n| Orebody type | 85% oxide / 15% refractory | 60% oxide / 40% refractory |\n| Access | Cortez Rangefront Declines | Cortez Rangefront Declines |\n| Ore transport | Conveyor | Autonomous loading with smart conveyor |\n| Processing | Primarily Cortez Leach | 60% Cortez mill, 40% Goldstrike Roaster |\n| Throughput | 4,500 tonnes per day | 4,500 tonnes per day |\n| Estimated initial capital expenditure | ~$155 million | ~$105 million |\n| Average annual production | ~300,000 | ~300,000 |\n| Cost of sales per ounce1 | ~$840 | ~$650 |\n| All-in sustaining costs per ounce2 | ~$580 | ~$580 |\n| Estimated first production | 2022 | 2022 |\nGoldrush, Nevada, U.S.A.\nProject Overview: Development of an underground mine at Goldrush.\nGoldrush is on track to become Barrick\u2019s newest mining operation in the Company\u2019s core district of Nevada. Decline construction, detailed engineering, and permitting (Environmental Impact Statement) are expected to take place between 2018 and 2020, with construction and initial production expected between 2021 and 2022, and sustained production expected from 2023. The first phase of the project involves the construction of an exploration twin decline to provide access to the orebody at depth, which will enable further exploration drilling, as well as the conversion of existing resources to reserves. The exploration declines are permitted and can be converted into production declines in the future.\nGoldrush currently has proven and probable gold reserves of 1.5 million ounces3 and measured and indicated gold resources of 9.4 million ounces3, with significant potential to identify additional resources once underground access to drill the deposit is established. In addition, the company is drilling the nearby Fourmile target, located one to three kilometers north of the Goldrush discovery. This area is geologically similar to the high grade Deep-Post and Deep-Star deposits in the Goldstrike area. Early drilling has intersected mineralization well above the average grade of the measured and indicated resources at Goldrush. Drilling to date suggests Fourmile and Goldrush may be part of a continuous, seven-kilometer-long mineralized system encompassing both deposits.\n| Prefeasibility | Feasibility (2017) | |\n| Internal approval status | Under review | Approved* |\n| Mining method(s) | Underground | Underground |\n| Orebody type | Refractory | Refractory |\n| Access | Declines | Declines |\n| Ore transport | Trucking | Trucking |\n| Processing | Goldstrike Roaster | Goldstrike Roaster |\n| Estimated initial capital expenditure | ~$1 billion | ~$1 billion |\n| Average annual production | ~440,000 ounces | ~500,000 ounces |\n| Cost of sales per ounce1 | ~$800 | ~$750 |\n| All-in sustaining costs per ounce2 | ~$665 | ~$640 |\n| Estimated first production | 2021 | 2021 |\n| Sustained production | 2023 | 2023 |\n| *Final Board approval pending start of major construction |\nBROWNFIELD EVALUATION\nLagunas Norte Mine Life Extension, La Libertad, Peru\nProject Overview: Extension of the mine life through sequenced installation of mill, carbon-in-leach, flotation, and autoclave processing facilities.\nThe first component of the project contemplates the construction of a grinding and carbon-in-leach processing circuit that would treat remaining carbonaceous oxide material at Lagunas Norte. Environmental permits for these facilities are already in hand, while construction permits are pending. We expect to complete detailed engineering in 2018 and 2019. If approved, construction and commissioning are anticipated to take place in 2019 and 2020, followed by initial production in 2021.\nThe second component of the project contemplates the construction of a flotation and autoclave processing circuit that would treat refractory material. If approved, detailed engineering and environmental permitting for these facilities is expected to take place between 2021 and 2023, with construction and commissioning between 2024 and 2026, followed by first production in 2027.\n| Prefeasibility | Feasibility Part 1 (2017) | Feasibility Part 2 (2017) | |\n| Internal approval status | Optimization required | Under review | Under review |\n| Mining method(s) | Open Pit | Stockpile rehandling | Open Pit |\n| Orebody type | Refractory | Carbonaceous Oxides | Refractory |\n| Processing | Mill/Carbon-in-Leach +Flotation/Autoclave | Mill/Carbon-in-Leach | Flotation/Autoclave |\n| Estimated initial capital expenditure | ~$640 million | ~$310 million | ~$405 million |\n| Average annual production | ~240,000 ounces | ~100,000 ounces | ~170,000 |\n| Estimated first production | 2021 | 2021 | 2027 |\n| Mine life extension | 2021-2030 | 2021-2026 | 2027-2037 |\n| Cost of sales per ounce1 | ~$1,080 | ~$1,015 | ~$875 |\n| All-in sustaining costs per ounce2 | ~$625 | ~$420 | ~$640 |\nPueblo Viejo, Sanchez Ramirez, Dominican Republic (60 percent Barrick / 40 percent Goldcorp)\nIn 2017, Barrick completed an initial scoping-level study for a plant expansion at the Pueblo Viejo mine that would increase throughput by 50 percent to 12 million tonnes per year, allowing the mine to maintain average annual production of 800,000 ounces after 2022 (100 percent basis).\nThe project involves the addition of a pre-oxidation heap leach pad with a capacity of eight million tonnes per year, a new mill and flotation concentrator with a capacity of four million tonnes per year, and additional tailings capacity. Higher-grade ore would be processed through the mill before moving through the flotation and autoclave circuits. Lower-grade ore would be treated on the pre-oxidation pad before moving through the mill and autoclave circuits.\nThis project has the potential to convert roughly seven million ounces3 of measured and indicated resources to proven and probable reserves (100 percent basis). Prefeasibility level studies have now been initiated, along with the construction of on-site proof of concept facilities for pre-oxidation and flotation.\nRobertson Property, Nevada, U.S.A.\nIn June 2017, Barrick completed the acquisition of the Robertson property and other claims in Nevada from Coral Gold Resources. The Robertson property is adjacent to Cortez, located just six kilometers north of the Pipeline mill. If successfully brought into production, material from the project would provide an additional feed for the Cortez mill, with the potential to extend open pit operations in the Cortez District. Robertson also has processing synergies with the Deep South underground expansion project at Cortez. In addition, the land package contains a number of promising near-mine exploration opportunities, as well potential new exploration targets in this highly prospective and prolific district.\nLONG-TERM OPTIONALITY IN GREENFIELD PROJECTS\nDonlin Gold, Alaska, U.S.A. (50 percent Barrick / 50 percent NOVAGOLD)\nDonlin Gold, located in Alaska, contains 19.5 million ounces3 of measured and indicated gold resources (Barrick\u2019s 50 percent share). The project represents one of the world\u2019s largest undeveloped gold deposits, at an advanced stage of permitting in a stable jurisdiction, underscoring its unique potential. We continue to work in collaboration with our partners at NOVAGOLD to optimize the project, including the potential for staged development, while reducing upfront capital and mitigating development risk. In support of this process, we completed a drill program of 7,040 meters in 2017 designed to further strengthen our understanding of target mineralized zones. Initial drilling results are encouraging and will form part of an overall geological review.\n| 2017 drilling campaign: Top five drill intercepts5 | |\n| DC17-1821 | 130.5 meters grading 5.93 g/t gold, starting at 205 meters depth |\n| DC17-1821 | 39.0 meters grading 9.34 g/t gold, starting at 342 meters depth |\n| DC17-1827 | 43.85 meters grading 7.60 g/t gold, starting at 453.15 meters depth |\n| DC17-1832 | 64.0 meters grading 5.09 g/t gold, starting at 547 meters depth |\n| DC17-1824 | 30.43 meters grading 10.30 g/t gold, starting at 208.57 meters depth |\nPermitting for the project remains underway. We expect the final Environmental Impact Statement to be published by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in early 2018, with a Record of Decision expected in the second half of the year.\nNorte Abierto, Atacama Region, Chile (50 percent Barrick / 50 percent Goldcorp)\nNorte Abierto, our new joint venture with Goldcorp in Chile, contains 11.6 million ounces3 of proven and probable gold reserves, and 13.3 million ounces3 of measured and indicated gold resources (Barrick\u2019s 50 percent share). The joint venture is now advancing an optimized project design, including an updated geological model for the Cerro Casale, Caspiche, and Luciano deposits. Work in 2018 will include trade-off and engineering studies on power, water, mining methods, and metallurgy, as well as ongoing stakeholder engagement and environmental baseline monitoring.\nPascua-Lama, San Juan Province, Argentina / Atacama Region, Chile\nPascua-Lama, located on the border between Argentina and Chile, contains 21.3 million ounces3 of measured and indicated gold resources. We continue to evaluate a block cave underground operation at Pascua-Lama with an initial processing capacity of 13,000-15,000 tonnes per day, with the potential to expand to 30,000 tonnes per day in the future. The project would utilize the existing process plant and tailings facility on the Argentinean side of the border, construction of which is already well advanced. A switch to underground mining addresses a number of community concerns by significantly reducing the overall environmental footprint of the project, as compared to an open pit operation.\nWe initiated a targeted drill program in November 2017 to improve ore body knowledge on the Argentinean side of the deposit, where further data was required to validate underground development plans and metallurgy. Ten of 12 holes have been completed thus far.\nAt present, the Pascua-Lama project does not meet Barrick\u2019s investment criteria. Our intention is to seek a partner for Pascua-Lama, allowing us to share capital costs and technical expertise, thereby reducing risk. We have formed a working group with Shandong Gold to study a potential partnership. Preparations for permitting an underground operation are underway in Argentina and Chile, including closure of existing surface facilities in Chile.\nAlturas, Coquimbo Region, Chile\nThe Alturas project, located in Chile on the El Indio Belt, is a Barrick greenfield discovery with 6.8 million ounces3 of inferred gold resources as of December 31, 2017. In 2017, we completed a scoping-level study for a conventional open pit heap leach operation at Alturas which fell just short of the Company\u2019s hurdle rate. In support of project optimization efforts, we are now undertaking additional drilling focused on increasing grades, adding and better-defining shallow near surface mineralization, and increasing potential mine resource tonnage.\nQUALIFIED PERSONS\nThe following qualified persons, as that term is defined in National Instrument 43-101 \u2013 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, have prepared or supervised the preparation of their relevant portions of the technical information described in this press release:\n- Patrick Garretson, Registered Member SME, Senior Director, Life of Mine Planning of Barrick\n- Steven Haggarty, P.Eng., Senior Director, Metallurgy of Barrick\n- Robert Krcmarov, FAusIMM, Executive Vice President, Exploration and Growth of Barrick\n- Rick Sims, Registered Member SME, Vice President, Resources and Reserves of Barrick\nINVESTOR CONTACT\nDeni Nicoski\nSenior Vice President\nInvestor Relations\nTelephone: +1 416 307-7474\nEmail: dnicoski@barrick.com\nMEDIA CONTACT\nAndy Lloyd\nSenior Vice President\nCommunications\nTelephone: +1 416 307-7414\nEmail: alloyd@barrick.com\nENDNOTE 1\nCost of sales related to gold per ounce is calculated using cost of sales related to gold on an attributable basis (removing the non-controlling interest of 40% Pueblo Viejo and 36.1% Acacia from cost of sales), divided by attributable gold ounces.

The uncertainty spooked the market, and the company desperately needed a positive ruling to give its stock a fresh lease on life. That happened last month.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nOn April 4, Eldorado announced that an arbitration panel in Greece has ruled in its favor in the dispute. That's exactly what Eldorado was waiting to hear, given its significant stake in Greece.\nThat news was the biggest trigger for Eldorado stock last month. The gold miner also reported its first-quarter numbers in the last week of April, but the market didn't react much to it.\nEldorado's first-quarter revenue climbed 17.9% and net income rose 28% year over year, backed by higher gold prices. Yet, the miner's all-in-sustaining-cost -- a key, comprehensive measure of costs for precious metal companies -- came in substantially higher at $878 per ounce of gold versus $791 per ounce in the year-ago period.\nThat's not all, though. Eldorado revealed that it's considering a 1-for-5 reverse stock split to avoid getting delisted from the New York Stock Exchange as its stock price has fallen below the $1 mark.\nNow what\nEldorado is targeting gold production of 290,000 to 330,000 ounces in fiscal 2018, which is a nice 6% uptick at the midpoint from its 2017 production level.\nThat said, Eldorado's costs remain high and its production growth depends a great deal on the timely development of key projects like Kisladag in Turkey and Lamaque in Quebec. It remains to be seen whether Eldorado can bring Lamaque online by early next year and receive permits for Kisladag in the first half of 2019.\nMeanwhile, Eldorado is undergoing a major management reshuffle, with Fabiana Chubbs exiting as the CFO last month. This comes close on the heels of Paul Wright quitting Eldorado's board late last year after retiring from the CEO's position in mid-2017.",

The metal edged up to $1,225.94 an ounce as of 12:12 p.m. in London on Wednesday.\nExchange-traded funds have been a source of gold supply from May through September as investors pared their holdings amid a price slump. The tide has turned: In the last week they have added 16.4 metric tons to their assets, the most since April, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nGold prices and fund flows are strongly correlated. In every year where holdings went up, gold has increased, and vice versa.\nThursday\u2019s 2.5 percent surge, which was the biggest jump since the U.K. voted to leave the European Union, blasted spot gold through its 50-day moving average. The momentum has continued into this week, pushing prices over the 100-day MA. For some chart watchers that\u2019s a sign bullion could be set for further gains heading into 2019.\nMeanwhile the dollar\u2019s vice-like grip on the shiny metal, which has punished prices this year, is easing. The correlation between the greenback and gold has weakened in recent months, indicating other drivers -- such as haven demand from investors fleeing equities -- could continue to firm up bullion.\nAnd yet...\n...for all its attributes as a financial asset, gold is still a commodity, and therefore reliant on physical demand. And its key anchor -- India -- is flagging. The rupee is sliding and local prices of gold are soaring. That suggests demand from the world\u2019s second-biggest buyer during the festival of Diwali next month may be weak for a third year running.\n(Updates with latest price.)\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Eddie van der Walt in London at evanderwalt@bloomberg.net;Ranjeetha Pakiam in Singapore at rpakiam@bloomberg.net\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Samuel Potter at spotter33@bloomberg.net, Sid Verma\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\u00a92018 Bloomberg L.P.",

(TSX: BTO) (NYSE AMERICAN: BTG) (NSX: B2G) (\u201cB2Gold\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) announces a positive initial open-pit resource at the newly-discovered El Limon Central zone, at the El Limon property in Nicaragua, of 5,130,000 tonnes at a grade of 4.92 grams per tonne (\u201cg/t\u201d) of gold containing 812,000 ounces of gold (refer to table below). This large, good grade new zone has the potential to decrease the El Limon Mine\u2019s cash operating costs and all-in sustaining costs per ounce, dramatically increase the El Limon mine life, and could lead to an expansion of the El Limon mill to a higher throughput rate which could potentially double annual gold production.\nThe El Limon Central zone, at its closest location, is approximately 150 metres from the El Limon mill facility, extending southeast and northwest, adjacent to existing plant and administrative infrastructure. Historical records indicate that parts of the Central zone had been mined underground in past decades. B2Gold\u2019s recent exploration work indicates the underground mining was much more limited than previously thought.\nThe El Limon central vein structure has been drill tested along a 2.2-kilometre strike length so far, and remains open to depth and along strike, and will be further drill tested during 2018. This structure has experienced some limited historic mining along its length. Further north, the structure extends along strike and this area is being drill tested at present.\nHighlighted results within the pit include 19.70 metres at 24.24 g/t gold (LIM-17-4119), 24.80 metres at 11.65 g/t gold (LIM-17-4112), 5.66 metres at 64.76 g/t gold (LIM-16-3984) and 15.70 metres at 20.04 g/t gold (LIM-17-4069).\nBelow and beyond the resource pit limits to the north, drill highlights include 2.0 metres at 13.43 g/t gold (LIM-17-4184) and 20.35 metres at 3.0 g/t gold, including 4.1 metres at 6.85 g/t gold (LIM-17-4198). All widths noted are true widths.\nThe Mineral Resource estimate was prepared in-house at B2Gold. A total of 248 drill holes (35,871 metres of drilling) were used in the gold grade estimate with more than 75% of the drill meterage (28,078 metres) coming from diamond drilling, completed by B2Gold. The remainder of the drilling was completed by previous owners during the late 1990s through early 2000s.\nInferred Mineral Resources reported at different gold cutoff grades are presented as a sensitivity case.\n| Cutoff Grade g/t gold | Tonnes | Grade g/t gold | Ounces1 |\n| 0.8 | 5,560,000 | 4.62 | 825,000 |\n| 1.0 | 5,330,000 | 4.78 | 819,000 |\n| 1.2 | 5,130,000 | 4.92 | 812,000 |\n| 1.4 | 4,950,000 | 5.05 | 804,000 |\n1.Mineral Resources are reported in accordance with NI 43-101 and the 2014 Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum \u201cDefinition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves\u201d (CIM Definition Standards). Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability\nInferred Mineral Resources are amenable to open-pit mining methods and are reported within a pit shell run using a gold price of US$1,400/oz., an average gold recovery of 83.8% (based on preliminary metallurgical testwork), and recent EL Limon Mine cash operating costs.\nThe 2017 El Limon budget was increased to USD$7.00 million and included over 30,000 metres of drilling in 157 holes with a focus on the El Limon vein. The 2018 El Limon budget is USD$7.00 million and will include 24,900 metres in 132 holes, again, with a focus on the El Limon vein.\nB2Gold is currently conducting additional metallurgical testing on the El Limon Central ore and a study to evaluate the potential to expand the El Limon throughput to significantly increase annual gold production and reduce cash operating costs. The study is expected by mid-2018.\nEl Limon Tailings Project Update\nIn 2017, an initial study was completed regarding the potential re-processing of the old tailings at the El Limon Mine. Based on historic mill and drilling records, the tailings contain an estimated 9 million to 11 million tonnes with a potential gold grade of 0.80 g/t to 1.0 g/t. An ongoing drilling program is underway as part of a feasibility study which will confirm resources and grades, the optimum grind size, capital costs and final project economics. Based on the initial study completed in 2017, the Company believes that the project has the potential to produce an average of approximately 20,000 to 25,000 ounces of gold and 70,000 to 80,000 ounces of silver per year for approximately 9 to 11 years. The concept is to regrind the old tailings to a much finer grind size, process them through a new CIP plant and place the tailings in a new lined tailings storage facility. The potential quantity and grade included in the initial study is conceptual in nature, and there has been insufficient exploration to date to define a Mineral Resource, and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target being delineated as a Mineral Resource.\nThe El Limon Mine has produced over 3 million ounces of gold since 1941, principally from the veins of El Limon, Talavera and Santa Pancha, the current focus of production. B2Gold purchased the mine in 2009, with the acquisition of Central Sun Mining, and the 19,200-hectare El Limon Mine is 95% B2Gold and 5% IMISA. The 2018 production forecast is between 55,000 to 60,000 ounces of gold.\nB2Gold\u2019s Quality Assurance/Quality Control\nThe primary laboratory for El Limon drilling program is Bureau Veritas Minerals in Vancouver, Canada. Core samples are prepared at El Limon preparation facility with the pulp sent to Vancouver and analysed using 30g fire assay with atomic absorption finish as well as multi-element ICP-MS analyses. SGS Laboratories in Medellin, Colombia, is the umpire laboratory.\nQuality assurance and quality control procedures include the systematic insertion of blanks, standards and duplicates into the core sample strings. The results of the control samples are evaluated on a regular basis with batches re-analysed and/or resubmitted as needed. All results stated in this announcement have passed B2Gold's quality assurance and quality control (\"QA/QC\") protocols.\nTom Garagan, Senior Vice President of Exploration, is the Qualified Person as defined under National Instrument 43-101, who has reviewed and approved the contents of this news release.\nAbout B2Gold\nHeadquartered in Vancouver, Canada, B2Gold Corp. is the world\u2019s new senior gold producer. Founded in 2007, today, B2Gold has five operating gold mines and numerous exploration and development projects in various countries including Nicaragua, the Philippines, Namibia, Mali, Burkina Faso, Colombia and Finland. With the large, low-cost Fekola Mine now in production, B2Gold is well positioned in achieving transformational growth in 2018. In 2018, with the planned first full year of production from the Fekola Mine, consolidated gold production is forecast to be between 910,000 and 950,000 ounces. This represents an increase in annual consolidated gold production of approximately 300,000 ounces for the Company in 2018 versus 2017.\nON BEHALF OF B2GOLD CORP.\n\u201cClive T.

Accordingly, such disclosure may not be comparable to similar information made public by companies that report in accordance with U.S. standards.\nThe Company has prepared its public disclosures in accordance with Canadian securities laws, which differ in certain respects from U.S. securities laws. In particular, this news release refers to \u201cmineral resources\u201d and \u201cinferred mineral resources\u201d. While these categories of mineralization are recognized and required by Canadian securities laws, they are not recognized by the SEC and are not normally permitted to be disclosed in SEC filings by U.S. companies. U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that any part of a \u201cmineral resource\u201d or \u201cinferred mineral resource\u201d will ever be converted into a \u201creserve.\u201d In addition, \u201creserves\u201d reported by the Company under Canadian standards may not qualify as reserves under SEC standards. Under SEC standards, mineralization may not be classified as a \u201creserve\u201d unless the mineralization can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time the \u201creserve\u201d determination is made. Accordingly, information contained or referenced in this news release containing descriptions of the Company\u2019s mineral deposits may not be compatible to similar information made public by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of U.S. federal securities laws, rules and regulations. \u201cInferred mineral resources\u201d have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Historical results or feasibility models presented herein are not guarantees or expectations of future performance.",

On Monday the dollar hit its lowest against the single currency since late 2014.\nThe greenback has weakened as markets have grown more confident that a global recovery would outpace U.S. growth.\nStock market strength also weighed on gold, said George Gero, managing director of RBC Wealth Management. Equities continued to climb as the Dow Jones Industrial Average topped 26,000 for the first time.\nGero added that broad commodity weakness also weighed on gold prices. U.S. wheat futures fell as did crude oil and copper, while nickel slid more than 5 percent.\nGold remained relatively firm after three 2017 U.S. interest rate hikes, but further rate hikes could pressure gold prices by raising the opportunity cost of non-yielding bullion.\n\"We see a trading range of $1,225-$1,430 for gold this year, with an average price of $1,290,\" INTL FCStone said in a note.\n\"Our number suggests we are closer to a top (than) a bottom, a position we are comfortable with as we are not sure gold could withstand the higher-yield environment going into next year, especially if the (weaker) dollar eventually reverses course.\"\nMore in News\nPalladium (XPD=), which hit a record high of $1,138 an ounce on Monday, was down 3 percent at $1,091.97 an ounce.

Operating costs and expenses decreased year-over-year due to lower stream GEOs sold during the quarter. Oil & Gas revenue increased 74.3% year-over-year, reflecting the addition of the STACK, Midland, Orion and Delaware royalties, higher prices and increased payments from Weyburn. Cash provided by operating activities was $137.5 million , an increase of 14.8% compared to Q1/2017, reflecting increased net income.\nCorporate Updates\n- Cobre Panama: Franco- Nevada funded the additional precious metals stream on the Cobre Panama project for $356.0 million on March 16, 2018 .

The dividend is a 4.3% increase from the previous $0.23 per share quarterly dividend and marks the 11th consecutive annual dividend increase for Franco-Nevada shareholders. Canadian investors in Franco-Nevada's IPO in December 2007 are now receiving an effective 8.1% yield on their cost base. The dividend will be paid on June 28, 2018 to shareholders of record on June 14, 2018 (the \"Record Date\"). The Canadian dollar equivalent is to be determined based on the daily average rate posted by the Bank of Canada on the Record Date. Under Canadian tax legislation, Canadian resident individuals who receive \"eligible dividends\" are entitled to an enhanced gross-up and dividend tax credit on such dividends.\nThe Company has a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (\"DRIP\"). Participation in the DRIP is optional. The Company will issue additional common shares through treasury at a 3% discount to the Average Market Price, as defined in the DRIP. However, the Company may, from time to time, in its discretion, change or eliminate the discount applicable to treasury acquisitions or direct that such common shares be purchased in market acquisitions at the prevailing market price, any of which would be publicly announced.

Its business model provides investors with gold price and exploration optionality while limiting exposure to many of the risks of operating companies. Franco-Nevada is debt free and uses its free cash flow to expand its portfolio and pay dividends. It trades under the symbol FNV on both the Toronto and New York stock exchanges. Franco-Nevada is the gold investment that works.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains \"forward looking information\" and \"forward looking statements\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws and the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, respectively, which may include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to future events or future performance, management's expectations regarding Franco-Nevada's growth, results of operations, estimated future revenues, carrying value of assets, future dividends and requirements for additional capital, mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates, production estimates, production costs and revenue, future demand for and prices of commodities, expected mining sequences, business prospects and opportunities. In addition, statements (including data in tables) relating to reserves and resources and gold equivalent ounces (\"GEOs\") are forward looking statements, as they involve implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, and no assurance can be given that the estimates and assumptions are accurate and that such reserves and resources and GEOs will be realized. Such forward looking statements reflect management's current beliefs and are based on information currently available to management. Often, but not always, forward looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \"plans\", \"expects\", \"is expected\", \"budgets\", \"scheduled\", \"estimates\", \"forecasts\", \"predicts\", \"projects\", \"intends\", \"targets\", \"aims\", \"anticipates\" or \"believes\" or variations (including negative variations) of such words and phrases or may be identified by statements to the effect that certain actions \"may\", \"could\", \"should\", \"would\", \"might\" or \"will\" be taken, occur or be achieved. Forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Franco-Nevada to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements. A number of factors could cause actual events or results to differ materially from any forward looking statement, including, without limitation: fluctuations in the prices of the primary commodities that drive royalty and stream revenue (gold, platinum group metals, copper, nickel, uranium, silver, iron-ore and oil and gas); fluctuations in the value of the Canadian and Australian dollar, Mexican Peso and any other currency in which revenue is generated, relative to the U.S. dollar; changes in national and local government legislation, including permitting and licensing regimes and taxation policies and the enforcement thereof; regulatory, political or economic developments in any of the countries where properties in which Franco-Nevada holds a royalty, stream or other interest are located or through which they are held; risks related to the operators of the properties in which Franco-Nevada holds a royalty, stream or other interest, including changes in the ownership and control of such operators; influence of macroeconomic developments; business opportunities that become available to, or are pursued by Franco-Nevada; reduced access to debt and equity capital; litigation; title, permit or license disputes related to interests on any of the properties in which Franco-Nevada holds a royalty, stream or other interest; whether or not Franco-Nevada is determined to have \"passive foreign investment company\" (\"PFIC\") status as defined in Section 1297 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; potential changes in Canadian tax treatment of offshore streams; excessive cost escalation as well as development, permitting, infrastructure, operating or technical difficulties on any of the properties in which Franco-Nevada holds a royalty, stream or other interest; actual mineral content may differ from the reserves and resources contained in technical reports; rate and timing of production differences from resource estimates, other technical reports and mine plans; risks and hazards associated with the business of development and mining on any of the properties in which Franco-Nevada holds a royalty, stream or other interest, including, but not limited to unusual or unexpected geological and metallurgical conditions, slope failures or cave-ins, flooding and other natural disasters, terrorism, civil unrest or an outbreak of contagious disease; and the integration of acquired assets. The forward looking statements contained in this press release are based upon assumptions management believes to be reasonable, including, without limitation: the ongoing operation of the properties in which Franco-Nevada holds a royalty, stream or other interest by the owners or operators of such properties in a manner consistent with past practice; the accuracy of public statements and disclosures made by the owners or operators of such underlying properties; no material adverse change in the market price of the commodities that underlie the asset portfolio; Franco-Nevada's ongoing income and assets relating to determination of its PFIC status; no material changes to existing tax treatment; the expected application of tax laws and regulations by taxation authorities; the expected assessment and outcome of any audit by any taxation authority; no adverse development in respect of any significant property in which Franco-Nevada holds a royalty, stream or other interest; the accuracy of publicly disclosed expectations for the development of underlying properties that are not yet in production; integration of acquired assets; risks related to the completion of previously announced transactions; and the absence of any other factors that could cause actions, events or results to differ from those anticipated, estimated or intended. However, there can be no assurance that forward looking statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Investors are cautioned that forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. Franco- Nevada cannot assure investors that actual results will be consistent with these forward looking statements and investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements due to the inherent uncertainty therein. For additional information with respect to risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to the \"Risk Factors\" section of Franco-Nevada's most recent Annual Information Form filed with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities on www.sedar.com and Franco-Nevada's most recent Annual Report filed on Form 40-F filed with the SEC on www.sec.gov. The forward looking statements herein are made as of the date of this press release only and Franco-Nevada does not assume any obligation to update or revise them to reflect new information, estimates or opinions, future events or results or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.\nNON-IFRS MEASURES: Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. These measures are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. For a reconciliation of these measures to various IFRS measures, please see below or the Company's current MD&A disclosure found on the Company's website, on SEDAR and on EDGAR. Comparative information has been recalculated to conform to current presentation.\n- GEOs include our gold, silver, platinum, palladium and other mineral assets. GEOs are estimated on a gross basis for NSR royalties and, in the case of stream ounces, before the payment of the per ounce contractual price paid by the Company. For NPI royalties, GEOs are calculated taking into account the NPI economics. Platinum, palladium, silver and other minerals are converted to GEOs by dividing associated revenue, which includes settlement adjustments, by the relevant gold price. The gold price used in the computation of GEOs earned from a particular asset varies depending on the royalty or stream agreement, which may make reference to the market price realized by the operator, or the average for the month, quarter, or year in which the mineral was produced or sold. For Q1/2018, the average commodity prices per ounce were as follows: $1,329 gold (Q1/2017 - $1,219 ), $16.77 silver (Q1/2017 - $17.42 ), $978 platinum (Q1/2017 - $981 ) and $1,035 palladium (Q1/2017 - $767 ).\n- Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA per share are non-IFRS financial measures, which exclude the following from net income and earnings per share (\"EPS\"): income tax expense/recovery; finance expenses; finance income; depletion and depreciation; non-cash costs of sales; impairment charges related to royalty, stream and working interests and investments; gains/losses on sale of royalty interests; gains/losses on investments; foreign exchange gains/losses and other income/expenses and unusual non-recurring items.\n- Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share are non-IFRS financial measures, which exclude the following from net income and EPS: foreign exchange gains/losses and other income/expenses; impairment charges related to royalty, stream and working interests and investments; gains/losses on sale of royalty interests; gains/losses on investments; unusual non-recurring items; and the impact of income taxes on these items.\n| Reconciliations to

U.S. gold futures <GCcv1> rose 0.5 percent to $1,352.90.\n\"We've seen fears of a trade war and now more recently the Russian sanctions,\" said Capital Economics analyst Simona Gambarini. \"Uncertainty, volatility and geopolitical risk have been rising steadily since the start of the year.\"\nThat has sparked good demand for gold through products such as bullion-backed exchange-traded funds, she said. \"Gold is benefiting from the risk-off sentiment and because people are trying to hedge against worst-case scenarios.\"\nEuropean equities fell after two days of gains as tensions over Syria and U.S. sanctions drove Russia's rouble to a two-year low, while concerns about the prospect of a trade war boosted traditional safety plays at the dollar's expense.\nThe U.S. unit languished near a two-week low against a basket of currencies.\nGold is often perceived as a safe store of value during times of political and financial uncertainty.\nMarkets are also awaiting cues on the outlook for U.S. monetary policy from consumer inflation data and minutes from the Federal Reserve's March meeting, due later on Wednesday.\nTighter monetary policy raises the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.\nAmong other precious metals, silver <XAG=> was up 0.2 percent at $16.59 an ounce, while platinum <XPT=> gained 0.5 percent to $928.50.\nPalladium <XPD=> was up 0.4 percent at $955.72.\nThe metal, more than 40 percent of which is produced in Russia, has bounced strongly this week as sanctions against the country fed into a technically driven rebound after the first quarter's 10 percent slide.\nAlthough Russian output of the metal has not been affected directly, the sanctions have caused enough concern over supply in a market that has been in deficit for a decade to bring some speculative money back in, analysts said.\n\"With (sanctions target) UC Rusal owning 28 percent of Norilsk Nickel, a significant producer of platinum group metals, traders remain wary that supplies of the precious metal may also be impacted,\" ANZ said in a note.\n(Reporting by Jan Harvey in London; Additional reporting by Swati Verma in Bengaluru; Editing by Dale Hudson and David Goodman)",

The company has been able to outperform by taking a different approach, which could enable it to continue delivering golden returns in the coming years.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nBuilding a top-ten gold miner one project at a time\nAgnico Eagle Mines traces its roots all the way back to 1953 when five struggling mining companies joined forces to create Cobalt Consolidated Mining company. Four years later the company renamed itself Agnico Mines, using the chemical symbols for silver (Ag), nickel (Ni), and cobalt (Co). In 1963, the company acquired Eagle Mines and changed its name to Agnico Eagle Mines.\nAgnico Eagle Mines would go on to complete a steady stream of acquisitions over the next several decades. In 1993, it purchased the Goldex mine, which at the time gave it control of the largest unexploited gold deposit in Quebec, Canada. Another notable purchase came in 2007 when the company bought Cumberland Resources for its Meadowbank gold project in Canada. Three years later it purchased Comaplex Mineral for its Meliadine gold project, which was within a couple of hundred miles of Meadowbank.\nIts most recent deal of note came in 2014 when it teamed up with Yamana Gold to buy Osisko Mining for its Canadian Malartic mine, which is one of the largest gold mines in Canada. The companies paid 3.9 billion Canadian dollars ($3 billion at the current exchange rate) in cash and stock for Osisko, which not only handed them Canadian Malartic but several exploration properties. Agnico Eagle would go on to buy out Yamana's 50% stake in those developmental assets in 2017 for $162.5 million.\nDigging into Agnico Eagle Mines\nAgnico Eagle Mines is primarily a gold mining company and ranks as the world's ninth largest gold producer in 2017 after digging up 1.7 million ounces. The company makes most of its money on this precious metal, which contributed 95% of total revenue in 2017, followed by silver at 4% and another 1% from various base metals, including zinc and copper.\nThe gold miner operates eight mines located in Canada, Finland, and Mexico. The biggest contributor to production in 2017 was Meadowbank, which is an open-pit mine in northern Canada that produced 352,526 ounces of gold and another 275,000 ounces of silver. However, while Meadowbank provided the most gold, it ranked as just the third largest contributor to the company's profit in the fourth-quarter of 2017 -- generating 18% of the total -- because its total cash costs were $614 an ounce, which was above the companywide average of $558.\nThe company's biggest money-maker was the LaRonde mine, which is also in Canada. This underground mine -- one of the deepest in the Western Hemisphere -- produced 348,870 ounces of gold along with 1.3 million ounces of silver, 6,510 tonnes of zinc, and 4,501 tonnes of copper in 2017. The mine was also one of the lowest cost in Agnico's portfolio, which enabled it to contribute 27% of the company's profits in the final quarter of 2017.\nA third noteworthy mine is Canadian Malartic, which is also in Canada. The company owns this mine through a 50-50 joint venture (JV) with Yamana Gold(NYSE: AUY) that the companies formed to acquire the mine's previous owner Osisko Mining in 2014. Despite sharing the profits and production, this mine still supplied Agnico Eagle with its third largest amount of gold at 316,731 ounces last year. Meanwhile, with low costs of $576 an ounce, the mine contributed 20% of the company's profits in the final quarter of 2017, good for second overall.\nIn addition to those core producing mines, Agnico Eagle has several expansion projects under way and new mines in development. The most notable in the near-term is Meliadine, which is in northern Canada and should start producing next year.\nDigging up value when others haven't\nAgnico Eagle Mines has been a rare find in the gold mining sector over the past couple of decades. While top-five gold producers like Barrick Gold(NYSE: ABX) and Goldcorp(NYSE: GG), as well as smaller ones such as Yamana, have all underperformed the price of gold (significantly in some cases), Agnico is one of the few that managed to outperform:\nOne reason Agnico has thrived while rivals haven't is due to its focus on creating value for investors on a per share basis. Many competitors issued boatloads of new shares to buy companies with operating mines that would boost production immediately. Agnico Eagle, on the other hand, focused on purchasing promising gold projects, which are mines in earlier stages of development. Because of that, the company didn't pay a premium for the current production, which kept its overall acquisition costs low.\nThe company took this approach due to its focus on growing the value of the company, not necessarily its size. Instead of aiming to increase production to an absolute level, the company measures its success by the rate at which it grows production per 1,000 shares. Since 2005, the company has delivered an 8.4% compound annual growth rate in this metric, increasing it from 2.47 ounces per 1,000 shares up to 7.36 ounces in 2017. This focus on growing production per share instead of aiming for an absolute number has helped steadily increase the net asset value (NAV) of each share. In fact, since 2005, Agnico Eagle's NAV has grown at an 11% compound annual rate versus just a 2% average rate for its peer group.\nAgnico Eagle Mines plans to continue focusing on creating value for shareholders in the coming years. One way it will do that is by steadily increasing production per 1,000 shares, which it aims to boost up to 8.34 ounces by 2020. While the company expects output to drop in 2018 due to the expected depletion of the Lapa mine in Canada and the winddown of Meadowbank through 2019, this will only be a temporary blip since the company sees production reaccelerating by 2020.\nPartially replacing Lapa's output will be the recently finished Zone 5 development of the LaRonde Mine, which should add 20,000 ounces in 2018 and produce as much as 45,000 ounces in 2020. Then in 2019, the company expects to bring the Amaruq Deposit at Meadowbank online. Agnico Eagle is investing $330 million into this project, which will help replace the lost output from that legacy mine by adding up to 190,000 ounces in 2019 and as much as 270,000 ounces in 2020. The Meliadine mine should also come online in 2019. The company is investing $900 million into this project, which should start producing by the second quarter of 2019 before adding 385,000 ounces of low-cost gold by 2020.\nThese investments will likely cause Agnico Eagle Mines to outspend cash flow in 2018, with it on pace to invest more than $1 billion, which would be slightly higher than anticipated cash flows at a gold price of $1,320 an ounce. However, as Amaruq and Meliadine go from cash consumers to cash producers in 2019, they'll help significantly increase the company's free cash flow as long as the price of gold holds up. These new additions will also boost companywide output up to 2 million ounces by 2020 as well as reduce the company's all-in sustaining cost (which is the overall production cost) from $915 an ounce to $850 an ounce by 2020. Because of those factors, the company could generate as much as $1 billion in free cash flow in three years, which would give it ample capital to fund additional expansions, pay down debt, or increase the dividend.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nDoes this make Agnico Eagle Mines' stock a buy?\nAgnico Eagle Mines appears poised to produce a motherload of cash in the coming years as long as the price of gold cooperates. That value-creating growth has the potential to continue pushing the stock price higher over the next few years.\nHowever, the company's stock price reflects a good bit of that upside. Shares recently traded at more than 13 times trailing twelve-month (TTM) cash flow from operations (CFO) per share. For comparison's sake, most larger peers changed hands closer to eight times that level while Yamana Gold traded at less than six times that number. Because of that pricier valuation, Agnico Eagle's stock could underperform its fellow miners even if the price of gold holds up. That's why investors might want to dig into the dirt cheap Yamana, which also has significant upside ahead thanks to an upcoming mine, before paying up to buy Agnico Eagle's stock.\nMatthew DiLallo has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

This bolstered the gold prices in the quarter under review.\nAll these recent developments and resulting volatility will continue to fuel gold prices as investors will shun risk assets such as equities and instead turn to gold. There are also plenty of reasons to be optimistic about gold\u2019s performance this earnings season and the rest of 2018. A number of new mines entered production in fourth-quarter 2017, which might support mine production till 2018. On the demand side, major markets, India and its neighbor China will continue to be growth drivers.\nLast year, the Indian market had suffered a setback due to the impact of imposition of Good and Service Tax (\u201cGST\u201d) and anti-money laundering legislation (\u201cAML\u201d) around jewelry retail transactions. We expect it to bounce back as the market adapts to GST. Pent-up demand as well as festive buying is anticipated to boost demand for jewelry in the country. Moreover, government measures like mandatory hallmarking in 2018 is likely to be a positive for the industry. Further, the United States continues to be a strong market driven by economic growth, improving employment levels and growth in consumer confidence.\nOverall Earnings Picture Looks Good\nPer the Zacks Industry classification, the gold mining industry is grouped under the Basic Material sector \u2014 one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors. The sector is currently placed at the top 19% out of the 16 Zacks sectors, and one of the sectors which is expected to record double-digit earnings growth. According to our latest projections, the sector is anticipated to log an earnings growth of 41.0% in first-quarter 2018 on the back of 19.8% rise in revenues.\nThe overall earnings picture for all the S&P500 members is encouraging this quarter. Total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up 18.3% for this earnings season on the back of a 7.7% rise in revenues. If this materializes, it would surpass fourth-quarter 2017 results where the S&P 500 recorded 13.4% earnings growth on 8.6% revenue growth \u2014 the best quarterly performance in more than six years.\nLet\u2019s see what\u2019s in store for the gold miners that are set to report quarterly numbers on Apr 26.\nNewmont Mining Corporation NEM is one of the world's largest producers of gold with several active mines in Nevada, Peru, Australia/New Zealand and Ghana.

        "full_text": "JOHANNESBURG, March 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nGold Fields Limited (Gold Fields) (JSE, NYSE: GFI) is pleased to announce it has, through a wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a definitive agreement subject to certain customary conditions to form a 50:50 incorporated joint venture with Canada's Asanko Gold, Inc (TSX/NYSE AMERICAN: AKG) (Asanko). The Gold Fields subsidiary has agreed to acquire a 50% stake in Asanko Gold Ghana Limited's (AGG) 90% interest in the Asanko Gold Mine, associated properties and exploration rights in Ghana (AGM). The AGM is a multi-deposit complex, with two main deposits, Nkran and Esaase, and nine known satellite deposits. The purchase consideration comprises an upfront payment of US$165m on closing of the transaction and a deferred payment of US$20m.\nIn addition, Gold Fields' subsidiary agrees to subscribe to a 9.9% share placement in Asanko by way of a private placement of 22,354,657 Asanko shares at a price of approximately US$0.79, equal to the five-day VWAP on the day prior to date of this announcement, for a total consideration of US$17.6m. The subscription will close shortly after the date of this announcement, and is not conditional on completion of the joint venture transaction.\nThe acquisition will be funded from cash and/or by drawing down on Gold Fields existing debt facilities. Importantly, the AGM is an in-production asset that generates EBITDA and cash flow and does not require any additional investment by the JV partners.\nRationale for the Acquisition\n- Portfolio management is one of Gold Fields' strategic objectives, as we continually seek to improve the quality of our portfolio (by lowering our all-in costs (AIC) and extending mine lives) to enhance Gold Field's cash generation.\n- The Asanko joint venture will give immediate access to low-cost production ounces, increasing the quality of the Gold Fields portfolio - Asanko's guidance for 2019-2023 is average annual production of 253koz (100% basis) at all-in sustaining costs (AISC) of US$860/oz, with a life-of-mine of at least 15 years. Further, the sizeable resource base of the asset is immediately accretive to Gold Fields in terms of life, with the potential for further discoveries on the large, relatively unexplored, tenement package (c.540km[2]) held by Asanko.\n- The transaction is also in line with our current growth strategy of focusing on jurisdictions in which we already have an established footprint. As the AGM is located in Ghana, we are adding an asset in a country where Gold Fields has extensive experience, having operated in Ghana for over 20 years.\nThe transaction exceeds our requirement of a return of 15% at a gold price of US$1,300/oz, with a payback period of five years out of an anticipated life-of-mine of at least 15 years. The transaction is demonstrably accretive to Gold Fields. We are comfortable that despite our current investment programme (Damang and Gruyere) this acquisition is well within our balance sheet capacity, particularly as it is a producing asset.\nAbout Asanko\nAsanko is a Canadian-based gold producer (listed on the TSX and NYSE AMERICAN) with operations in Ghana. Asanko's principal assets are the Obotan operation (which includes the Nkran deposit) and the Esaase deposit (collectively the AGM), which are situated 100km north of Gold Fields' Tarkwa and Damang operations along the prospective and under explored Asankrangwa greenstone belt in Ghana.\nFollowing Asanko's acquisition of PMI Gold Inc. (PMI) in 2014, Asanko combined its Esaase gold project with PMI's Obotan gold project to form the AGM and pursued a phased development and expansion strategy. The construction of the first phase, essentially the Obotan gold project, including a 3 Mtpa carbon-in-leach processing facility and associated infrastructure, was completed in early 2016. Commercial production was declared on 1 April 2016, and the operation reached steady-state production levels by the end of the second quarter of 2016.\nAsanko provided guidance to the market with the release of its full year results on 15 March 2018. For 2018, AGM is targeting production of 200-220koz (100% basis) at AISC of US$1,050-1,150/oz, due to investment in the Nkran Cut 2 pushback and the associated increased waste stripping. Beyond 2018, over the five-year period from 2019 to 2023, average annual production is expected to be 253koz (100% basis) at AISC of US$860/oz.\nParticulars of the proposed transaction\nUpon completion, Gold Fields will hold a 45% interest in AGG - the Ghanaian company that holds the mining assets. The remaining AGG shareholders will be Asanko (45% through its existing offshore holding structure) and the Ghana Government (10% free carried). In addition, Gold Fields will hold a 9.9% listed stake in Asanko.\nThe aggregate consideration comprises:\nUpfront consideration: US$165m payable on closing of the transactions, which will be used to immediately retire the AGG's existing external debt, being a loan from the Red Kite group of US$164m, leaving Asanko debt free.\nDeferred consideration: US$20m payable on the earlier of an agreed Esaase development milestone or 31 December 2019.\nShare placement: Gold Fields will subscribe for 9.9% share placement in Asanko by way of a private placement of 22,354,657 Asanko shares at a price of approximately US$0.79, equal to the five-day VWAP on the day prior to date of this announcement, for a total consideration of US$17.6m.\n- Gold Fields and Asanko will establish a 50:50 incorporated joint venture. Asanko will continue to manage the operations and will remain the operator. A joint venture management committee, comprising representatives from Asanko and Gold Fields, will be formed for purposes of overseeing the operation of the mine, with material decisions (including budgets, capital expenditure) requiring unanimous approval. A technical sub-committee will also be formed to provide technical advisory services to the management committee.\n- The transaction is subject to customary conditions precedent including, among others, no Asanko material adverse event, and Ghanaian Ministerial approval for the indirect (by way of change of control) transfer of the various mining properties. Completion is anticipated to occur in Q3 2018.\nNotes to editors\nAbout Gold Fields\nGold Fields Limited is a globally diversified gold producer with seven operating mines in Australia, Ghana, Peru and South Africa, and a total attributable annual gold-equivalent production of approximately 2.2 million ounces.

Investors reacted as if this signaled the BoJ was moving towards lifting stimulus later this year.\nThe Euro rallied to its highest level against the U.S. Dollar in three years after the European Central Bank minutes showed policymakers discussed lifting monetary policy stimulus earlier than expected.\nIn other news, Boston Federal Reserve President Eric Rosengren warned that the recent drop in U.S. unemployment could spark a surge in inflation that, given the Federal Reserve\u2019s current policy framework, could trigger interest-rate hikes that bring on recession.\nHedge funds and money managers raised their net long positions in COMEX gold and silver contracts in the week to January 9, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) data showed on Friday.\nThe current price action and upside momentum strongly suggests that the gold rally will continue over the near-term until prices reach the September top at $1365.80. The hedge fund buying has been steady so I don\u2019t feel there is any danger of gold becoming overbought.\nGold traders seem to have learned how to deal with the stock market surging to new all-time highs nearly every day and rising Treasury yields, this is a strong indication that the buying is real and being primarily driven by the weaker U.S. Dollar. Look for the rally to continue as long as the dollar remains under pressure.\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire",

A trade through $1328.60 will signal a resumption of the uptrend. If this move gains enough traction, we could see an eventual test of the September 8 main top at $1365.80.\nThe market isn\u2019t close to changing the main trend to down, but it is in the window of time for a potentially bearish closing price reversal top.\nThe main range is $1365.80 to $1238.30. Its retracement zone is $1302.10 to $1317.10. Trader reaction to this zone will determine the near-term tone of the market. The important level to watch is the Fibonacci level at $1317.10. This level has been straddled for eight trading sessions.\nAn even longer-term retracement zone comes in at $1290.20 to $1272.30. This zone is a target and support zone.\nThe short-term range is $1238.30 to $1328.60. If there is a correction then its 50% level at $1283.50 will be the primary downside target. Since the main trend is up, buyers are likely to come in on a test of this level.\nDaily Technical Forecast\nBased on the current price at $1318.70 and the earlier price action, the direction of the gold market today is likely to be determined by trader reaction to the Fibonacci level at $1317.10.\nHolding above $1317.10 will indicate the presence of buyers. Overtaking the steep uptrending angle at $1318.30 will indicate the buying is getting stronger. Crossing over to the strong side of the downtrending angle at $1322.80 and sustaining the move could trigger a move into $1328.60. This price could be the trigger point for a possible acceleration into the next downtrending Gann angle at $1344.30. This is the last potential resistance angle before the $1365.80 main top.\nA sustained move under $1317.10 will signal the presence of sellers. The daily chart indicates there is plenty of room to the downside with $1302.10 the next likely target. This is followed by $1290.20 and $1283.50.\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire",

Besides technology, S&P consumer discretionary, healthcare, energy and materials indexes all were up more than 1 percent on the day.\nMajor stock indexes closed out 2017 with their best performances since 2013. Many investors say the rally could continue this year with help from the recently approved U.S. tax overhaul that is anticipated to boost profits as well as the economy.\n\"We're off to the races once again,\" said Stephen Massocca, senior vice president at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco.\n\"I don't expect the kind of moves we saw last year. But as long as monetary policy stays the way it is ... my view is stocks are going to have a decent year. And fiscal policy has become stimulative, as well, given the tax bill.\"\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 104.79 points, or 0.42 percent, to 24,824.01, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 22.18 points, or 0.83 percent, to 2,695.79 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 103.51 points, or 1.5 percent, to 7,006.90.\n\"Our best guess is the first quarter or half of the year can be OK as a continuation of last year,\" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.\nBut, he said, \"valuations are still stretched, interest rates are still rising, and those will provide headwinds to the market at some point.\"\nThe S&P consumer discretionary index (.SPLRCD) was up 1.5 percent, helped by a gain in Amazon of 1.7 percent.\nJ.C. Penney (JCP.N), Nordstrom (JWN.N) and Kohl's (KSS.N) climbed after a bullish Citigroup note on the retail sector detailed benefits from the corporate tax cuts.\nMore in Business\nEnergy shares were up even though oil prices dipped. Oil hovered near mid-2015 highs amid large anti-government rallies in major exporter Iran and ongoing supply cuts led by OPEC and Russia. The S&P energy index (.SPNY) rose 1.8 percent.\nShares of casino operators Wynn Resorts (WYNN.O) and Melco Resorts & Entertainment (MLCO.O) were down after a report showed a lower-than-expected rise in Macau gambling revenue in December.\nAbbott Labs (ABT.N) jumped 3 percent and hit an intraday record of $59.20 after two brokerages upgraded the company's stock to \"overweight.\"\nShares of insurer Allstate (ALL.N) were down 2.7 percent following a brokerage downgrade.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.64-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.01-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\nAbout 6.7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges.

if 25-metre levels are used, then net cash flows are estimated as $558-million (U.S.); this cash flow includes conceptual allowances for capital;\n- Production of an estimated average of 108,000 AuEq (1) ounces per annum over an eight-year period from year 2 through to year 9;\n- An estimated pretax net present value (NPV) of $415-million (U.S.) for 25-metre levels, or $397-million (U.S.) for 15-metre levels, using current metal prices, exchange rates and a 5-per-cent discount;\n- An estimated after-tax NPV of $329-million (U.S.) for 25-metre levels, or $316-million (U.S.) for 15-metre levels, using current metal prices, exchange rates and a 5-per-cent discount;\n- Initial capital cost is estimated to be $13.8-million (U.S.), including the $3.3-million (U.S.) for the plant upgrade identified in the Mincore scoping study, but excluding the proposed Kora exploration inclines and diamond drilling; sustaining capital cost is estimated to a further $64-million (U.S.) spent over the life of the Kora mining for 25-metre levels, or $83-million (U.S.) for 15-metre levels;\n- Operating cost per tonne is estimated to be $125 (U.S.) per tonne for 25-metre levels, or $126 (U.S.) per tonne for 15-metre mining levels;\n- Excluding initial capital expenditure of $14-million (U.S.), cash cost is estimated to be $547 (U.S.) per ounce AuEq (inclusive of a 2.5-per-cent net smelter return (NSR) royalty) and all-in sustaining cost (AISC) of $619 (U.S.) per ounce AuEq for 25-metre mining levels, or $549 (U.S.) per ounce (inclusive of a 2.5-per-cent NSR royalty) and AISC of $644 (U.S.) per ounce AuEq for 15-metre mining levels.\nMetal prices used were $1,300 per ounce for gold, $18 (U.S.) per ounce for silver and $4,800 per tonne for copper.\n(1) Gold equivalent calculated on above metal prices.\nKora remains open for expansion in every direction and strongly mineralized at the extent of all drilling.\nThe PEA is preliminary in nature and includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA will be realized. The technical report contains a full description of all underlying assumptions relating to the PEA. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability.\n| Table 3.0 IRUMAFIMPA AND KORA/EUTOMPI RESOURCES | ||||||||||\n| Resource by Deposit and Category | ||||||||||\n| Deposit | Resource Category | Tonnes | Gold | Silver | Copper | Gold Equivalent | ||||\n| Mt | g/t | MOz | g/t | MOz | % | Mlb | g/t | MOz | ||\n| Irumafimpa | Indicated | 0.56 | 12.8 | 0.23 | 9 | 0.16 | 0.28 | 37 | 13.4 | 0.24 |\n| Inferred | 0.53 | 10.9 | 0.19 | 9 | 0.16 | 0.27 | 74 | 11.5 | 0.20 | |\n| Kora/Eutompi | Inferred | 4.36 | 7.3 | 1.02 | 35 | 4.9 | 2.23 | 215 | 11.2 | 1.57 |\n| Total Indicated | 0.56 | 12.8 | 0.23 | 9 | 0.16 | 0.3 | 4 | 13.4 | 0.24 | |\n| Total Inferred | 4.89 | 7.7 | 1.21 | 32 | 5.06 | 2.0 | 218 | 11.2 | 1.76 | |\nM in Table is millions.

Bitcoin investors saw as the price of a Bitcoin plummet from nearly US$20,000 to fall under US$10,000 over the holiday season.\nThat has prompted many investors to question which is the better investment, and in many cases turn to another investment type that was increasingly overlooked in the latest crypto craze: precious metals.\nIs there still an allure to gold?\nPrecious metals were long viewed as a safe and secure store of wealth for investors; previous metals were rare, in demand, and, for the most part, increasing in value. The flip side of that argument often cited by crypto enthusiasts is that as physical as a bar of gold or bullion coin may be, it isn\u2019t divisible and can\u2019t readily be used as a form of payment.\nGold is still viewed in an increasing number of circles as a secure store of wealth. While gold prices have for the most part appreciated over time, there were times in the past decade when the price of gold dropped substantially. By way of example, in 2011 gold was trading at near US$1,900 per ounce, but fell to sub-US$ 1,100 levels within three years.\nThe price of gold has since recovered to over US$1,300 per ounce, and pundits now see the price pushing past US$1,400 per ounce over the course of the next two years. For investors contemplating a precious metals investment, this opens up a realm of investment possibilities.\nOne such investment opportunity is Barrick Gold Corp (TSX:ABX)(NYSE:ABX). Barrick is the world\u2019s largest gold miner, with operations in several countries across the Americas as well as in Australia and Papua New Guinea.\nOne of the things that really impresses me about Barrick is the company\u2019s focus on reducing its debt. In the years following the 2011 drop in gold prices, Barrick was left with over US$10 billion in debt. As of the most recent quarterly update, that debt is now down to US$6.4 billion, and the company is attempting to get that down to US$5 billion by the end of the current year. In fact, over the course of the past year, Barrick wiped out nearly one-fifth of its debt.\nThe other area in which Barrick has excelled is that of efficiency. After the 2011 price drop, miners adopted a method of reflecting their costs in terms of producing an ounce of gold, commonly referred to as all-in sustaining costs. The lower those costs are, the more profit the miner earns. Even better, with gold appreciating in price, margins on mining gold are set to further increase.",

Low inflation could diminish hopes of at least three rate hikes by the Fed in 2018.\nTraders are also saying that gold prices are getting support from weaker equity and bond prices. Investors aggressively sold off positions in both asset classes after the U.S. Senate and House passed the largest sweeping U.S. tax reform bill in nearly 30 years. This strongly suggests the news may have already been priced into the market.\nFurthermore, there are some concerns that tax reform may have little benefit for the economy and that it may contribute more to government debt levels.\nThe chart pattern suggests that strong upside momentum could drive gold prices to at least $1290.20 over the near-term. Key support today comes in at $1278.50.\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire",

While the chart pattern doesn\u2019t mean the trend is changing to up, it does indicate that the buying may be greater than the selling at current price levels especially after the prolonged sell-off in terms of price and time.\nAugust Comex Gold settled at $1255.80, up $1.30 or 0.10%.\nThe catalyst behind the short-covering rally and reversal chart pattern was lower U.S. Treasury yields. Falling yields helped make the U.S. Dollar a less-desirable asset, increasing demand for dollar-denominated gold.\nYields fell partly in response to the mixed U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls report which showed a better-than-expected headline number, but an unexpected rise in the unemployment rate and weaker-than-expected average hourly earnings.\nAs a result of the jobs report, expectations of a fourth U.S. Federal Reserve rate hike later this year declined. According to the Fed Funds Indicator, investors priced in a 77 percent chance of a September rate hike, down from 80 percent before the jobs data.\nSo while a September rate hike is still a likely event, traders feel that without an acceleration of wage growth, a fourth hike at the end of the year is a more difficult call and the futures market shows that traders are putting the odds of a December rate hike at about 50 percent.\nWeekly Technical Analysis\nThe main trend is down according to the weekly swing chart. However, the closing price reversal bottom suggests momentum may be shifting to the upside.\nA trade through $1262.40 will confirm the closing price reversal bottom. This could trigger the start of a 2 to 3 week counter-trend rally sometimes equal to 50% to 61.8% of the last down swing.\nA trade through $1238.80 will negate the reversal bottom chart pattern and signal the resumption of the downtrend with initial targets a pair of main bottoms at $1230.70 and $1228.20.\nThe long-term retracement zone is $1268.80 to $1242.80. The market is currently trading inside this zone. This area is controlling the longer-term direction of the market.\nThe main range is $1375.10 to $1238.80. If confirming the closing price reversal bottom generates enough upside momentum, we could see an eventual rally into its retracement zone at $1307.00 to $1323.00.\nWeekly Technical Forecast\nBased on last week\u2019s price action and the close at $1255.80, the direction of the August Comex Gold market this week is likely to be determined by trader reaction to $1262.40.\nTaking out $1262.40 will confirm the closing price reversal bottom. This could trigger a quick move into the major 50% level at $1268.80, followed by the steep downtrending Gann angle at $1271.10.",

This volume of 4E PGM ounces is as of Dec. 31, 2017.

The White House said on Wednesday it will seek to trim the U.S.\u2019s trade deficit with China by $100 billion, using tariffs. The European Union, meanwhile, was working to get the bloc exempt from the tariffs.\nEarly Friday, April gold (XCEC:GCJ8) rose $3.00, or 0.2%, to $1,320.80 an ounce. Its finish at $1,317.80 an ounce Thursday was the lowest since March 1 and sets up the contract to finish the week down 0.2%, according to FactSet data.\nThe ICE U.S. Dollar Index (IFUS:DX-Y.NYB) was down 0.2% at 89.957 and down about 0.2% for the week. The index had churned in and out of positive territory. Gold and the dollar typically move inversely. A weaker U.S. currency makes dollar-denominated gold more attractive to investors using another currency; the reverse is true as well, with a steeper dollar typically weighing on gold.\n\u201cIt is noticeable that the worst-performing currencies were the commodity currencies. These are getting hit in anticipation that the U.S. will target China more directly with a variety of specific trade restrictions, which could dampen Chinese demand for metals and other commodities,\u201d said Marshall Gittler, chief strategist at ACLS Global.\n\u201cIn that respect, a trade war could boost [the U.S. dollar], although I don\u2019t think the Chinese would stand by idly and let this happen without any retribution \u2013 I think it would be likely to rebound on U.S. trade quickly, well before it helped to boost U.S. production and thereby narrow the trade deficit,\u201d Gittler said.\nThe market has been confined in a relatively tight range and so, gold market-timers looking for a buy signal need a clearer bearish sign, writes Mark Hulbert in his latest column.\n\u201cThat\u2019s because there still isn\u2019t the widespread despair and pessimism that typically precede tradable gold rallies,\u201d he wrote.\nBut once that signal emerges? \u201cConsider the average recommended gold-market exposure level, as measured by the Hulbert Gold Newsletter Sentiment Index (HGNSI). March 2017 was the last time this average got close to the minus 30% level that have accompanied significant past bottoms. Gold bullion rose 8% over the subsequent three months,\u201d he said.\nRead:Here\u2019s the ideal amount of gold to keep in your investment portfolio\nMeanwhile, May silver (XCEC:SIK8) tipped 0.3% higher, tacking on 5 cents, to $16.47 an ounce.

April platinum (XNYM:PLJ8) lost 0.1% to $955.70 an ounce, while June palladium (XNYM:PAM8) was flat near $981 an ounce.\nAmong exchange-traded funds, the silver-focused exchange-traded iShares Silver Trust (SLV) rose 0.6% and the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) was down 0.3%.

Late in the session, a comment by President Trump spiked the market lower into the close.\nThe U.S. Dollar recovered a little on Wednesday and Thursday after the minutes of its July 31 \u2013 August 1 FOMC meeting, revealed that the central bank plans to continue its gradual pace of rate increases. It further added that Fed officials are wary of tariffs hurting the current economic recovery but are waiting to see evidence of widespread damage in economic data.\nWeekly gains were erased on Friday after a key speech by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. In his widely expected speech before a group of major central bankers at the Jackson Hole, Wyoming symposium, Powell said he anticipates a slow and steady pace of rate hikes as the central bank looks to balance economic growth and curbing lofty asset prices.\nSuggested Articles\n-\nLT Yields Fall, Gold Spikes Higher as Powell Hints at Move Toward Neutral Rates\n-\nThe Week Ahead \u2013 Geo-Political Risk and the Economic Calendar in Focus\n-\nOil Price Fundamental Weekly Forecast \u2013 Wildcards This Week Will Be North Sea Strike, U.S. Dollar\nOther News\nThere were no government reports on hedge fund and money manager positions, but we have to suspect a drop in the record number of net short positions announced in the week to August 14. Last week\u2019s strong upside bias was likely fueled by massive short-covering.\nA significant drop in the number of net short positions will be very important to the chart structure because this could be interpreted to mean that short-sellers are aggressively covering, and new buyers are returning.",

So essentially, it has erased the negative impact of Turkey\u2019s \u201cmini\u201d currency crisis.\nWith concerns over Turkey taken out of the equation, investors are likely to go back to focusing on the overall trend of the U.S. Dollar, Treasury yields and Fed rate hike expectations.\nForecast\nThe new trade agreement between the U.S. and Mexico is weighing on the dollar, helping to support dollar-denominated gold because many professionals had maintained safe-haven positions in the dollar throughout the ordeal. With concerns over Mexico lifted, dollar bulls no longer have to hold on to these hedges.\nHowever, dollar bulls are still holding on to long positions because of the on-going trade dispute between the U.S. and China. Therefore, gold is likely to be limited to the upside. Any trade escalation between the two countries will play favorably into the U.S. Dollar as a risk aversion trade. This likely means that the professionals will continue to hold on to their net short gold positions.\nIn order to turn gold bullish, the net shorts in gold are going to have to completely flip to the long side. This is not likely to occur unless the US-China dispute is settled early, or if the Fed takes a December rate hike off the table.\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\nMore From FXEMPIRE:\n-\nGlobal Stock Markets Get a Boost after US-Mexico Trade Deal, Trade War Still a Threat\n-\nDAX Index Price Forecast \u2013 Dax Opens Positive on News of Trump & Merket Supporting EU-US Trade Talks\n-\nE-mini NASDAQ-100 Index (NQ) Futures Technical Analysis \u2013 August 28, 2018 Forecast\n-\nE-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM) Futures Analysis \u2013 August 28, 2018 Forecast",

At one point it rose to 2.727 percent.\nThe dollar rose against a basket of currencies as bond yields climbed. The dollar index (.DXY) rose 0.33 percent, with the euro (EUR=) down 0.31 percent to $1.2380. The Japanese yen (JPY=) eased 0.23 percent versus the greenback at 108.95.\nOil prices slipped, pressured by a strengthening dollar and rising U.S. crude output. But prices remained on track for the biggest January increase in five years.\nBrent crude futures (LCOc1) fell $1.06 to settle down at $69.46 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (CLc1) settled down 58 cents at $65.56 a barrel.\nGold prices fell as a rebounding U.S. dollar and rising government bond yields prompted investors to cash in bullion after its sixth weekly price rise in seven weeks.\nU.S. gold futures for February delivery (GCv1) settled down $11.80 an ounce at $1,340.30.\n(Reporting by Herbert Lash; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Nick Zieminski)",

        "full_text": "Gold prices are trading higher early Friday in reaction to a weaker U.S. Dollar. Traders are afraid that President Trump\u2019s decision to impose trade tariffs on steel and aluminum imports may lead to retaliation that should have a negative effect on the U.S. Dollar which could conceivably provide gold with some support.\nAt 0854 GMT, April Comex Gold futures are trading $1318.50, up $13.30 or +1.02%.\nOn Thursday, the Trump administration said the tariffs would protect U.S. industry, but the dollar and stocks fell sharply as the plan sparked fears of a trade war and worries about its potentially negative impact on the world\u2019s largest economy.

In his second day of testimony this week, Powell said there was no evidence the U.S. economy is overheating, and labor markets may still have room to improve as the central bank sticks with a gradual pace of rate hikes.\nForecast\nThe main trend is down in gold on the daily chart, but on Thursday, the market found support inside a major retracement zone at $1306.60 to $1291.50.\nIt would be easy to say that aggressive counter-trend buyers stopped the selling on Thursday at $1303.60, however, this isn\u2019t how the events unfolded. The surprise tariff actually triggered a short-covering rally.\nThe battle lines have been drawn. Both bullish and bearish gold traders are going to watch and react to the direction of the U.S. Dollar.\nThe dollar is likely to weaken if Canada, Asia and Europe decide to retaliate against the new U.S. tariffs. Losses could be softened by higher U.S. Treasury yields, which tend to make the dollar a more attractive investment. A weaker U.S. Dollar should be supportive for gold prices.\nAt this time, all we have is the trend, the support zone and uncertainty over the timing of the expected retaliation. Because of this, I suspect gold is going to become rangebound until investors decide how to play the market.\nThe trend is clearly to the downside, but if there is enough uncertainty, we could see a counter-trend short-covering rally in gold over the near-term.\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire",

His breadth of knowledge and capacity ranges from multi-million to multi-billion-dollar projects.\nBetween 2004-2008, Lello was the project manager of the Tenke Fungurume Project, a Phelps Dodge greenfield copper and cobalt mine development in the Democratic Republic of Congo. This US$2 billion project was developed from concept studies to first copper cathode production in January 2009.\nIn 2009, Mr. Galassi worked for Rio Tinto Iron Ore Expansion Projects, a group of Rio Tinto focused on developing new greenfield mines and plants in NW Australia. He led the project studies teams and engineering contractors in developing a new mine, new bulk material port loading facility and new heavy haul rail systems for the Turee Syncline Project and for expansions at the Dampier Port facilities.\nIn late 2010, Lello was asked by Rio Tinto to lead the very-large African Guinea Simandou Iron Ore Project as a Project Director \u2013 General Manager. This US$18 billion greenfield project scope included a new mine, new processing plant, over 750 km of new heavy haul rail and machinery, a new deep water port facility, and all supporting systems including camps, warehouses, power generation, airfields and construction support port facilities.\nIn 2013, Mr. Galassi took a position as COO and Project Director of the Aurora Gold Mine Project for Guyana Goldfields. This greenfield project had a capital value of approximately US$300 million and was a joint effort of Guyana Goldfields, financial institutions, and the International Finance Corporation. The project commenced in Q2 2013 with successful completion and first-gold pour in Sep 2015.\nFollowing the Aurora Project, from 2015-2018, he assumed a position as project director for the Phoenix Projects, a combination of brownfield and greenfield mining projects in Barcelona, Spain. The projects included a new 5 km long underground access ramp to the mine, new processing plants for potash and salt derivatives, new rail systems and a new greenfield bulk material handling/ storage port facility in the Barcelona Port. These projects had a combined value of US$500 million.\nSabina Gold & Silver Corp.\nSabina Gold & Silver Corp. is well-financed with approximately C$94.5million in cash and equivalents, and is an emerging precious metals company with district scale, advanced, high grade gold assets in one of the world\u2019s newest, politically stable mining jurisdictions: Nunavut, Canada.\nSabina released a Feasibility Study on its 100% owned Back River Gold Project which presents a project that has been designed on a fit-for purpose basis, with the potential to produce ~200,000 ounces a year for ~11 years with a rapid payback of 2.9 years (see \u201cTechnical Report for the Initial Project Feasibility Study on the Back River Gold Property, Nunavut, Canada\u201d dated October 28, 2015) (the \u201cStudy\u201d). At a US$1,150 gold price and a 0.80 (US$:C$) exchange rate, the Study delivers a potential after tax internal rate of return of approximately 24.2% with an initial CAPEX of $415 million.\nThe Project received its final Project Certificate on December 19, 2017. The Project is now in the final regulatory and licensing phase.\nIn addition to Back River, Sabina also owns a significant silver royalty on Glencore\u2019s Hackett River Project. The silver royalty on Hackett River\u2019s silver production is comprised of 22.5% of the first 190 million ounces produced and 12.5% of all silver produced thereafter.\nFor further information please contact:\nNicole Hoeller, Vice-President, Communications: 1 888 648-4218\nnhoeller@sabinagoldsilver.com\nForward Looking Information\nThis news release contains \u201cforward-looking information\u201d within the meaning of applicable securities laws (the \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d), including our belief as to the extent, results and timing of and various studies relating to engineering studies, infrastructure improvement activities, exploration results and permitting and licensing outcomes.

It has previously shied away from acquisitions.\nThe company produced about 1.3 million ounces of gold last year. Its business model is based on a $1,000 an ounce gold price.\nRandgold proposed a doubling of its dividend to $2 per share, when it reported its latest results earlier this month.\n\"If we don't find anything that fits our criteria we should continue to give money back to shareholders,\" Bristow said.\nRandgold's shares rose 15 percent in 2017 but are down by similar margin so far this year on market concerns over its DRC business.

Subsequent drilling has outlined a sulphide resource estimate, using multiple cut-offs1 of 284,000 Indicated ounces of gold grading 6.04 grams per tonne (\"g/t\") and 39,000 Inferred ounces grading 2.41 g/t gold (see Nevada Sunrise news release dated November 5, 2015 ). 1Cut-off grades assume an open-pit mining scenario, using a pit floor elevation generated using Whittle software, reasonable assumptions for mining and milling costs, and a US$1,300 /ounce gold price.\nA total of seven reverse circulation holes were started in the 2018 program, with five holes completed and two lost at shallow depths due to voids and fault zones encountered. Total meterage for the 2018 program was approximately 1,830 metres (6,005 feet). Highlights of the drilling were as follows:\n- PK228 intersected 5.42 g/t gold over 9.1 metres from 275.8 metres to 285.0 metres, including 7.77 g/t gold over 6.1 metres from 277.4 metres to 283.5 metres, at the Secret Canyon-Geddes contact, 50 metres east of 2017 hole PK221, which intersected 5.30 g/t over 29 metres. This new intercept in PK228 represents a significant step out in the Western Flank Zone (\"WFZ\") east extension exploration. Liberty Gold has recommended follow up in subsequent drill programs.\n- PK229 and PK229A were drilled to intersect the Secret Canyon shale beneath the Ridge Pit area. Both of these holes were cut short due to drilling problems related to voids and fault zones in the shallow units. However, these holes did provide valuable data in specific fault zone locations and mineralized breccia zones near the faults. Of note, PK229A returned 1.15 g/t gold over 15.2 metres from 91.4 metres to 106.7 metres, in brecciated Notch Peak and Hamburg Dolomite adjacent to the KNW fault zone. This is very encouraging for follow-up testing of the lower units in this vicinity, as it indicates strong hydrothermal fluid flow during the local mineralization event.\n- PK226 was the first hole of the program in the WFZ east extension area, targeted to test a modelled east-west trending zone between the WFZ and the historical PK200/PK215 intercepts about 170 metres east of the WFZ high-grade zone. This hole returned multiple mineralized intercepts, including 1.54 g/t gold over 6.1 metres from 135.6 metres to 141.7 metres in the Dunderberg Shale, and 0.77 g/t gold over 7.6 metres from 249.9 metres to 257.6 metres in the Secret Canyon Shale.\nThe first hole of the program, PK225 was drilled into the Anticline Target, an area with no previous drilling, to test the Secret Canyon Shale southeast of the Western Flank Zone and returned a lower-grade interval of 0.45 g/t gold over 1.5 metres in the shallow Notch Peak limestone. Hole PK227 was drilled to test the Secret Canyon-Geddes contact and returned a lower-grade interval in the Dunderberg Shale of 0.55 g/t gold over 6.1 metres from 141.7 metres to 147.8 metres. The last hole of the program, PK230, encountered voids and fault zones, but showed no significant results.\nFor maps showing the 2018 target areas and drill hole locations, please access Nevada Sunrise's website at: http://www.nevadasunrise.ca/projects/kinsley-mountain/\nDrill composites were calculated using a minimum cut-off of 0.20 g/t gold. Drill intersections are reported as drilled thicknesses. True widths of the mineralized intervals vary between 30 and 100 percent of the reported lengths due to varying drill hole orientations, but are typically in the range of 60 to 80 percent of true width. Drill samples were assayed by ALS Limited in Reno, Nevada for gold by Fire Assay of a 30 gram (1 assay ton) charge with an AA finish, or if over 5.0 g/t were re-assayed and completed with a gravimetric finish. For these samples, the gravimetric data were utilized in calculating gold intersections. For any samples assaying over 0.200 ppm an additional cyanide leach analysis is done where the sample is treated with a 0.25% NaCN solution and rolled for an hour. An aliquot of the final leach solution is then centrifuged and analyzed by AAS. Metallic screen techniques may be employed where the presence of coarse free gold is suspected. Approximately 1000 grams of coarse reject material are pulverized and screened. Two splits of the fine fraction are assayed, as well as all material that does not pass through the screen (the coarse fraction). The final gold assay reported is a weighted average of the coarse and fine fractions.

If this generates enough upside momentum then look for the rally to extend into the 50% level at $1268.80, followed by the steep downtrending Gann angle at $1279.10. The latter is the trigger point for an acceleration to the upside.\nA sustained move under $1254.50 will signal that the short-sellers are still in control. This could trigger a retest of the Fibonacci level at $1242.80, followed closely by the long-term uptrending Gann angle at $1239.40. This angle essentially stopped the selling earlier this week at $1238.80.

The crisis intensified after U.S. sanctions over a detained American pastor and now Trump\u2019s doubling down import tariffs on steel and aluminum metals has made the situation worse (read: Low-Risk ETFs Taking Off on Rising Tariff Threats).\nThe breakdown of Turkish lira has made it harder for Turkish companies to pay back loans they have taken in the U.S. currency. If the troubles continue, many economists have warned that Turkey could slip into a recession and the debt crisis would require a bailout from the International Monetary Fund.\nMarket Impact\nThe contagion has been spreading across the global market with other emerging currencies bearing the brunt of the lira\u2019s downward spiral. The South African rand hit a low level not seen since mid-2016, the Russian roble slumped again and the Indian rupee slid to an all-time trough. Investors are also fearing that the country\u2019s financial crisis could hit the European markets as well.\nThe events have led to risk-off trading with lower risk securities, including precious metals and bonds, being in vogue. A few ETFs were severely impacted by the plunging lira while a few look to offer stability or even profits. Below are six ETFs that are especially volatile in the wake of the Turkey crisis:\niShares MSCI Turkey ETF TUR\nThe Turkey ETF was the worst performer on Friday, losing 14.5% and saw its worst week since 2008 shedding 20.6%. The fund tracks the MSCI Turkey Investable Market Index and holds 62 stocks with none accounting for more than 7.7% of assets. The product has AUM of $299.4 million and charges 62 bps in fees per year from investors.\nSPDR Gold Trust ETF GLD\nGold is often viewed as a store of value and a hedge against market turmoil. The product tracking this bullion like GLD could be an interesting pick amid market turbulence. The fund tracks the price of gold bullion measured in U.S. dollars. It is the ultra-popular gold ETF with AUM of $30.7 billion and expense ratio of 0.40%. However, it has lost 0.04% in the last trading session (read: Gold in Longest 4-Year Losing Streak: Go Short with ETFs).\niShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF TLT\nThe U.S. government bonds tracking the long end of the yield curve often carry a safe haven status. The flight-to-safety on Turkey predicament pushed these bonds higher over the past week. As such, the ultra-popular long-term Treasury ETF \u2013 TLT \u2013 was up 0.7% in the last session. It tracks the ICE U.S. Treasury 20+ Year Bond Index and has AUM of over $7.5 billion. Expense ratio comes in at 0.15%. Holding 32 securities in its basket, the fund focuses on the top credit rating bonds, with average maturity of 25.62 years and effective duration of 17.44 years (see: all the Government Bond ETFs here).\niPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN VXX\nThe VIX is often known as the fear index as it surges when investors are skittish about the market\u2019s current direction. Obviously, this is the case right now and the ETN tracking this benchmark has gained in the last trading session. VXX is up 4.9% and is a very liquid choice for traders seeking to make a bet on fear levels in the market. The note focuses on the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index and has amassed $869.1 million in AUM. It charges 89 bps in fees per year. However, investors should note that volatility products have been terrible performers over the medium and long terms due to a contangoed market and a steep roll cost.\nInvesco CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust FXY\nYen is considered a safe-haven currency in times of uncertainty. Concerns about the crisis-hit Turkey spreading to European banks sent investors scurrying to safe havens including the U.S. dollar, Swiss franc and Japanese yen. Investors could tap this via FXY, which appears a great way to play a future rise in the yen relative to the U.S. dollar. It tracks the movement of the yen relative to the U.S. dollar. The fund charges 40 bps a year in fees and has accumulated $125.1 million in its asset base. It has added 0.2% on Friday (read: BoJ Mulling Over Policy Change: ETFs in Focus).\nProShares UltraShort FTSE Europe EPV\nFor investors seeking to make an outright bet against the European stocks, an inverse ETF could be the way to go. EPV offers two times (200%) the inverse (opposite) of the daily performance of the FTSE Developed Europe All Cap Index. The ETF has gained nearly 4% on Friday and has AUM of $19.8 million. It charges 95 bps in annual fees. While the strategy is highly beneficial for short-term traders, it could lead to huge losses compared with traditional funds in fluctuating or seesaw markets. Further, their performances could vary significantly from the actual performance of their underlying index over a longer period when compared to the shorter period (such as, weeks or months) due to their compounding effect.\nWant key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?\nZacks\u2019 free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

        "full_text": "Forget the Stock Market. Investors Are Trading in Gold for Bitcoin\nLucinda Shen\nUpdated\nBitcoin, the heavyweight of the cryptocurrency world, has billed itself as digital gold\u2014a safe haven for investors to park their assets.\nApparently that image is having an impact. While Bitcoin\u2019s status as a potential substitute investment to the shiny precious metal with thousands of years of human history is debatable, some investors are foregoing physical gold for its significantly younger brethren.\nAs Bitcoin prices inched toward an all-time high price above $19,500 in December, Byron Salamida, 48, of San Diego took some of his gold coins and decided to sell them at a local precious metals dealer. He planned to take the cash and purchase cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin\u2014as he had been doing for the past two years. After all, while his gold coins were simply sitting there, with roughly the same value minute after minute, the price of the cryptocurrencies he owned was shooting up\u2014seemingly into the stratosphere.\n\u201cWhy keep something in gold? It\u2019s stable. But why keep it in gold when it stays in a $100 range, when I could buy Bitcoin when it is increasing everyday?\u201d Salamida said.\nHe was surprised to find when he got to the precious metals seller where he planned to offload his wares that he wasn\u2019t the only gold owner who had the same idea.\nThe shop owner bought the gold from Salamida for about $5 to $10 below spot price, citing low demand. The owner mentioned he had noticed a recent surge in customers who were selling gold in a bid to buy Bitcoin.\n\u201cThere was definitely a trend where it seemed like for a month people were selling precious metals for cryptocurrencies,\u201d says Michael McConnell, the owner of precious metal seller San Diego Coin and Bullion, where Salamida has been selling his gold coins for the past two years. \u201cIt seemed like it was every day\u2014some days two or three times\u2014[customers] would talk about Bitcoin.\u201d\nWhile McConnell says that the price at which he bought and sold Salamida\u2019s coins had little to do with Bitcoin demand (those prices are actually determined by yet another, larger precious metal dealer), recent research reports have pointed to a larger trend at play.\n\u201cThe rapidly accelerating popularity and price in cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin\u2026diverted substantial amounts of capital away from precious metals last year,\u201d Thomson Reuters analysts wrote of gold demand in the U.S. in their 2017 Gold Survey released in January. \u201cRetail investors tend to have a shorter investment horizon these days and with cryptocurrencies recording parabolic increases over the year, many consumers were not able to withstand the temptation to get on board.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a relatively recent development, says RBC Capital Markets Commodity Strategist Christopher Louney, who said he has noticed a potential correlation between cryptocurrency prices and the value of gold. While the relationship appeared nonexistent before, Louney said the trend emerged late in 2017 and continued into early 2018\u2014suggesting that as the price of Bitcoin soared into the quadruple digits, some investors may have been offloading gold to pay for cryptocurrencies.\nThere\u2019s some logic behind the correlation. Gold and Bitcoin certainly have their differences, but in several ways, they also appeal to the same set of investor sensibilities.\n\u201cThey\u2019re stateless, with some people perceiving both as stores of value,\u201d says Louney. \u201cThere\u2019s a similar psychology happening among the investors.\u201d\nFor Salamida, the two assets did tug at similar heartstrings. One of the reasons why he was attracted to gold was because he didn\u2019t trust the existing financial powers that be.\n\u201cI got foreclosed on in 2011. The banks weren\u2019t really working with me to come to a resolution. I was just laid off in 2010. It just snowballed,\u201d he said. \u201cI kind of had a distrust of banks and the monetary system.\u201d\nHe then made a living off of selling goods on eBay and buying into gold. In 2014, Salamida met Bitcoin, and \u201ceverything just clicked into place.\u201d\nBut Bitcoin\u2019s proponents should stay their hands before crowning the cryptocurrency the new gold.\nLouney stresses that the correlation is minor\u2014not quite enough to move gold prices, and not quite enough to say that investors are currently seriously considering Bitcoin as gold\u2019s replacement. Another caveat: the data is sparse. The same macroeconomic factors that have traditionally affected gold prices still dominate the playing field, with stock market performance being one of those factors. Mostly due to rising equity returns, Louney says he expects gold prices to end the year lower than they started, and at around $1,303 on average for the year.\nBitcoin is, after all, far more volatile than gold, and still relatively unknown compared to other investment assets. Gold, on the other hand, is well established with institutional investors and has quite a bit of liquidity. While Bitcoin trading volumes tallied up to just over $3 billion daily in recent trading, gold trading volumes reach $250 billion a day, according to the World Gold Council.\nThough that\u2019s not to say a Bitcoin-gold correlation won\u2019t deepen with time, says Looney, who admits he will continue tracking the relationship. Though the emerging relationship also means that the converse may one day also be true\u2014spooked Bitcoin investors could cash in their cryptocurrency in hard times for a less volatile asset.\nSo it wouldn\u2019t be strange if Salamida, to some extent, wished he had held his assets in something steadier than Bitcoin. After all, the cryptocurrency\u2019s ups and downs have occasionally left him queasy, with the asset soaring to $20,000 on some exchanges in December, before falling below $6,000 earlier this month. Now, it rests just above $8,000.\nBut Salamida said he is holding tight and waiting for the bottom. He is saving cash from his day job in cybersecurity and from gold sales. He maintains, however, that he would never go into debt to buy cryptocurrency, or use his credit card account to purchase the digital assets.\n\u201cI am loading up on cash on the sidelines to accumulate crypto on the dips. Like the old saying from Rothschild, \u2018the time to buy is when there\u2019s blood in the streets,\u2019 \u201d he said.\nAnd to those who have left the fold of the gold bugs for the den of the \u201ccrypto crazies\u201c? You\u2019re always welcome back.\n\u201cWe wish you luck. More power to you,\u201d precious metal retailer McConnell said, professing that he himself knows little about Bitcoin and its peers. \u201cBut if you want gold, we\u2019re here.\u201d",

This application is currently awaiting final approval by the Minister of the Environment. Approval is expected in the third quarter of 2018.

Petrographic work on samples collected in 2016 concluded that the massive sulphide mineralization intersected by our 2016 drilling has an epigenetic origin. Recent analysis by our Senior Geophysical Consultant of the IP survey completed in 2011, combined with physical properties testing on drill core, suggest that additional ground IP surveys could assist in identifying the continuation of the massive sulphide mineralization and assist in drill targeting. The oxide mineralization at the Candelones Main and Connector deposits is a compelling exploration target given that metallurgical work in 2007 indicated robust gold recoveries. Review of the historical drilling suggests that the oxide mineralization extends from surface to a depth of 10-15 metres. We believe the oxide resource represents an opportunity for a small, efficient and profitable starter pit that would establish early initial cash flow allowing for the development of the higher grade, sub-surface sulphide resource at the Candelones Extension.\u201d\nThe current mineral resource estimates for the Candelones Project, comprised of the Candelones Main, Candelones Connector and Candelones Extension deposits (Ref.

Lewis, P.Geo. and Mr. A. San Martin, MAusIMM(CP) of Micon International Ltd. (\u201cMicon\u201d), a Toronto based consulting company, independent of Unigold. Both Mr. Lewis and Mr. San Martin meet the requirements of a \u201cqualified person\u201d as established by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (May 2014) (\u201cthe CIM Standards\u201d). The 2014 estimate is based on a long term gold price of US$ 1,500 per ounce and economic cut-off grades 0.32 g/t Au (OXIDE), 0.56 g/t (SULPHIDE) and 1.25 g/t (UNDERGROUND SULPHIDE). Open pit resources are reported within an optimized pit shell; underground resources are reported beneath the defined optimized pit shell.\n- Mineral resources were estimated by Mr. W. Lewis, P.Geo. and Mr. A. San Martin, MAusIMM(CP) of Micon International Ltd. (\u201cMicon\u201d), a Toronto based consulting company, independent of Unigold. Both Mr. Lewis and Mr. San Martin meet the requirements of a \u201cqualified person\u201d as established by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (May 2014) (\u201cthe CIM Standards\u201d). The 2014 estimate is based on a long term gold price of US$ 1,200 per ounce, a long term copper price of US$ 3.00 per pound and an economic cut-off grade of 3.50 g/t Au and assumed exploitation of the Candelones Extension deposit by means of underground mining.\n- The mineral resource estimates are classified as INFERRED. CIM Standards define a Mineral Resource as \u201ca concentration of material in or on the Earth's crust in such form and quantity and of such grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction.\" The CIM Standards further define an INFERRED Mineral Resource as \"that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonable assumed but not verified, geological and grade continuity.\" The CIM Standards state: \"Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource as a result of continued exploration.\n- Micon has not identified any legal, political, environmental or other risks that could materially affect the potential development of the mineral resource presented.\n- The procedures, methodology and key assumptions supporting this mineral resource estimate are included in the Technical Report titled: \"NI-43-101 Technical Report Mineral Resource Estimate for the Candelones Project, Neita Concession, Dominican Republic\" with an Effective Date of November 4, 2013. The Technical Report is available on SEDAR as well as the Company's website.\n- The procedures, methodology and key assumptions supporting this mineral resource estimate are included in the Technical Report titled: \"NI-43-101 Technical Report Mineral Resource Estimate for the Candelones Extension Deposit, Candelones Project, Neita Concession, Dominican Republic\" with an Effective Date of February 24, 2015. The Technical Report is available on SEDAR as well as the Company's website.\n- Contains 41,175,000 lbs copper grading 0.35%.\nOxide Resource Opportunity\nHistorical drilling and trenching at the Candelones Main deposit intersected oxide mineralization where the Candelones Main deposit outcrops on the Candelones Main hill. Extensive surface trench sampling, largely at the Candelones Main deposit (~4000 samples), averages 3.5 g/t Au.\nThe exploration data defines a WNW trending corridor for over 500 metres in length and measures approximately 100 metres in width. The interpreted oxide trend is coincident with the topographic high defining the Candelones Main hill (Reference Figure 2.0).\nAt the Candelones Connector deposit, 200 metres to the southeast, a second oxide trend, measuring 250 metres in length and 100 metres in width, trends NE. The Connector oxide trend is defined largely by diamond drilling and is open along strike in both directions.\nFigure 2.0 \u2013 Candelones Main and Connector Oxide Resource Area\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/930bc2ad-2e21-47f4-8c2b-e2e6283e5620\nThe 2013 mineral resource estimate (Reference Table 1.0), estimated a total inferred oxide resource of 72,000 ozs of gold at the Candelones Main deposit with an additional 40,000 ozs of gold at the Candelones Connector. The average grade of the inferred oxide resource was estimated to be 1.0 g/t Au. Of particular interest is the fact that the average grade of the trench sample data from the defined oxide resource area is 3.5 g/t Au. As core recovery in the oxide mineralization was typically less than 50%, the Company believes that the grade of the oxide resource, based solely on the diamond drill results, may be understated.\nThe Company is planning to excavate targeted, vertical test pits centered on historical drill holes that intersected high grade oxide mineralization (Reference Figures 3.0 and 4.0). All four walls of the pits will be continuously channel sampled vertically on 1.0 metre intervals. The samples would be assayed for gold using the Company\u2019s established assaying protocol. In addition, bottle roll and cyanide leach analyses will be completed to provide an initial estimate of metallurgical recovery.\nFigure 3.0 \u2013 Candelones Main Oxide Resource Section A-A\u2019 Looking North\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/be084dda-f368-475b-a91e-050f32aaab57\nThe assay results will be compared directly to the results returned by the drill hole on which the test pit is centered. The Company believes this will provide an indication as to whether or not the observed core loss in diamond drilling has understated the grade of the oxide resource.\nThe Company is currently identifying suitable excavators in the Dominican Republic that would be able to complete the planned test pit program.\nAssuming that the results of the test pit program confirm there is an opportunity to increase the grade of the oxide resource, then the Company would initiate efforts to mobilize a reverse circulation drill to site and complete a close spaced drill program along the two oxide trends. The objective of that drill program would be to establish the limits of the oxide resource and complete a measured and indicated mineral resource estimate that would support a Pre-feasibility level study.\nFigure 4.0 \u2013 Candelones Connector Oxide Resource Section B-B\u2019 Looking East\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/46954a15-4ab2-4c8f-b16f-a43e8db17016\nHigh Grade Sulphide Opportunity\nExploration drilling during 2016 focused on high grade areas within the defined mineral resource footprint with the dual objectives of defining a mineral resource amenable to underground mining and to increase the confidence level of the inferred resource to measured and indicated classification. This targeted approach identified three areas of higher grade mineralization within the existing mineral resource footprint, all of which remain open and represent an opportunity to increase both the size and quality of the mineral resource estimate.\nTable 2.0 presents the significant intercepts of the most recent exploration at the Candelones Extension deposit.\nTable 2.0 \u2013 Significant Drill Intercepts - 2016\n| Target | Hole ID | From | To | Interval (1) | Au | Cu |\n| (#) | (m) | (m) | (m) | (g/t) | (%) | |\n| \"Target A\" - Au-Cu rich massive to semi-massive sulphides-flat lying, plunging 30 degrees NE, historical drilling overshot this massive sulphide system which remains open down plunge to the east. | LP15-93 | 298.6 | 314.3 | 15.7 | 7.45 | 1.1 |\n| LP15-94 | No massive or semi massive sulphides | |||||\n| LP15-95 | 252.6 | 287.5 | 34.9 | 6.19 | 0.6 | |\n| 309.9 | 314.0 | 4.1 | 7.31 | 1.1 | ||\n| LP15-96 | 279.0 | 313.0 | 34.0 | 4.15 | 0.4 | |\n| 324.0 | 333.0 | 9.0 | 4.81 | 0.7 | ||\n| LP16-101 | 409.6 | 419.4 | 9.8 | 3.10 | 0.6 | |\n| LP16-102 | No massive or semi massive sulphides | |||||\n| LP16-114 | 256.8 | 278.0 | 21.2 | 6.00 | 0.9 | |\n| LP16-115 | 288.3 | 294.0 | 5.7 | 3.80 | 1.2 | |\n| LP16-116 | 214.0 | 239.0 | 25.0 | 1.50 | 0.0 | |\n| LP16-117 | 290.0 | 295.0 | 5.0 | 1.80 | 0.6 | |\n| LP16-118 | 180.0 | 185.0 | 5.0 | 7.80 | 0.3 | |\n| and | 252.0 | 257.0 | 5.0 | 3.06 | 0.9 | |\n| LP16-124 | 333.3 | 339.2 | 5.9 | 11.80 | 0.2 | |\n| LP16-126 | No massive or semi massive sulphides | |||||\n| LP16-127 | No massive or semi massive sulphides | |||||\n| \"Target B\" -Stacked vertical feeder, upper Zn-Ag-Au-Cu mineralization; lower Au-Cu massive to semi-massive sulphides similar to \u201cTarget A\u201d. | LP16-97 | 249.0 | 264.0 | 15.0 | 1.15 | 0.0 |\n| LP16-98 | 245.8 | 250.6 | 4.8 | 7.32 | 0.2 | |\n| LP16-99 | 276.6 | 283.0 | 6.4 | 4.23 | 0.2 | |\n| LP16-100 | 291.1 | 300.6 | 9.5 | 2.43 | 0.2 | |\n| and | 307.5 | 319.5 | 12.0 | 7.46 | 1.4 | |\n| LP16-119 | 224.7 | 264.5 | 39.8 | 1.40 | 0.1 | |\n| LP16-120 | 255.2 | 274.0 | 18.8 | 2.00 | 0.1 | |\n| and | 363.0 | 369.7 | 6.7 | 3.30 | 1.9 | |\n| LP16-121 | 269.5 | 302.0 | 32.5 | 0.90 | 0.1 | |\n| LP16-122 | No significant values | |||||\n| LP16-123 | 265.4 | 280.1 | 14.7 | 6.50 | 0.9 | |\n| and | 371.5 | 379.5 | 8.0 | 9.40 | 0.9 | |\n| LP16-128 | 249.6 | 274.0 | 24.4 | 3.20 | 0.2 | |\n| and | 333.8 | 336.5 | 2.7 | 5.20 | 0.7 | |\n| and | 461.0 | 462.1 | 1.1 | 0.60 | 0.4 | |\n| \"Target C\" - Au-Ag-Zn rich semi-massive sulphides - open to the west - historical drilling interpreted to have overshot this higher grade mineralization. | LP16-103 | 117.0 | 123.0 | 6.0 | 8.86 | 0.2 |\n| LP16-104 | 134.9 | 138.2 | 3.3 | 5.06 | 0.2 | |\n| LP16-105 | 176.0 | 184.0 | 8.0 | 6.30 | 0.1 | |\n| LP16-106 | 141.0 | 154.3 | 13.3 | 1.08 | 0.1 | |\n| LP16-107 | 168.0 | 311.0 | 143.0 | 1.44 | 0.1 | |\n| LP16-108 | 190.0 | 197.0 | 7.0 | 1.30 | 0.3 | |\n| LP16-109 | 165.0 | 169.0 | 4.0 | 10.10 | 0.2 | |\n| LP16-110 | 155.4 | 160.0 | 4.6 | 3.40 | 0.1 | |\n| 233.0 | 245.0 | 12.0 | 9.70 | 0.1 | ||\n| LP16-111 | 250.0 | 252.0 | 2.0 | 5.00 | 0.2 | |\n| LP16-112 | No significant values | |||||\n| LP16-113 | 223.1 | 228.6 | 5.5 | 4.10 | 0.1 |\n(1) - Interval is measured down hole and should not be interpreted as true width.\nJeremy S. Brett, M.Sc., P.Geo. of MPH Consulting Limited (\u201cMPH\u201d), the Company\u2019s Senior Geophysical Consultant, has reviewed the IP data acquired by Insight Geophysics Inc. in 2011. They have advised the Company of the following:\n- Inversion of the data by MPH indicates that IP accurately depicts the mineral resource envelop at Candelones (Reference Figures 5.0 and 6.0);\n- The 2011 IP data is not optimally oriented to isolate the massive sulphide mineralization intersected in 2016. The NE orientation of the massive sulphide mineralization places it in the null of the N-S oriented IP gradient lines (Reference Figure 1.0);\n- The 2011 IP survey included N-S Insight Sections on roughly 400 metre spacings. This line spacing was not adequate to resolve the high grade, sub vertical feeders identified by recent drilling; and\n- The 2011 survey was designed to evaluate the IP responses to a depth of 300 metres from surface. Deeper looking Insight Section data is required to resolve the Massive Sulfide body.\nFigure 5.0 - Candelones Extension IP Survey Inversions with Resource Shell looking NNW\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/6cce8aef-dfeb-4381-a758-b95b09270e63\nMPH has recommended a follow up IP survey with the following design considerations:\n- Close spaced IP gradient lines on 100 metre centres;\n- Lines would be oriented parallel and perpendicular to the massive sulphide mineralization; and\n- The survey would be designed to evaluate to a maximum depth of 500 metres from surface.\nFigure 6.0 \u2013 Candelones Extension IP Survey Inversions with Resource Shell looking NW\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/f664643a-dbd7-4b59-bc22-cdc1c896d453\nThe Company believes that the new IP survey will highlight the massive sulphide mineralization and provide a signature response that can be used to evaluate targets elsewhere within the Concession boundary in the future. It will also assist in drill targeting to expand the massive sulphide mineralization and, by extension, increase the mineral resources of the Candelones Extension deposit.\nMPH has provided a grid layout. On approval of the Environmental License, the Company plans to mobilize local labour to establish the grid in the field. The Company currently estimates that the grid can be established within a month of approval of the Environmental License. The IP survey can commence once the grid has been established.\nThe Company believes that the IP survey can be completed and drill targets generated within six months of approval of the Environmental License.\nQA/QC\nDiamond drilling utilizes both HQ and NQ diameter tooling. Holes are established using HQ diameter tooling before reducing to NQ tooling to complete the hole. The core is received at the on-site logging facility where it is photographed, logged for geotechnical and geological data and subjected to other physical tests including magnetic susceptibility and specific gravity analysis. Samples are identified, recorded, split by wet diamond saw, and half the core is sent for assay with the remaining half stored on site. A minimum sample length of 0.3 metres and a maximum sample length of 1.5 metres are employed with most samples averaging 1.0 metres in length except where geological contacts dictate. Certified standards and blanks are randomly inserted into the sample stream and constitute approximately 5-10% of the sample stream. Samples are shipped to a sample preparation facility in the Dominican Republic operated by Bureau Veritas. Assaying is performed at Bureau Veritas Commodities Canada Ltd.\u2019s laboratory in Vancouver, B.C. Canada. All samples are analyzed for gold using a 50 gram lead collection fire assay fusion with an atomic adsorption finish. In addition, most samples are also assayed using a 36 element multi-acid ICP-ES analysis method.\nWes Hanson P.Geo., Chief Operating Officer and Technical Director of Unigold, who is a qualified person under the definitions established by National Instrument 43-101, has reviewed and approved the contents of this press release.\nAbout Unigold Inc. \u2013 Discovering Gold in the Caribbean\nUnigold is a Canadian based mineral exploration company traded on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol UGD, focused primarily on exploring and developing its gold assets in the Dominican Republic.\nFor further information please visit www.unigoldinc.com or contact:\n| Mr. Joseph Del Campo, | |\n| Interim President & CEO | |\n| jdelcampo@unigoldinc.com 416.866.8157 |\nForward-looking Statements\nCertain statements contained in this document, including statements regarding events and financial trends that may affect our future operating results, financial position and cash flows, may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

The index rose 0.88% on Wednesday.\nThe stronger dollar pressured gold, which is denominated in the U.S. currency and becomes less affordable for holders of other currencies when the dollar rises.\nInvestors were looking ahead to U.S. consumption and price data later in the day, which will be closely watched for indications on the possible direction of monetary policy.\nIn other precious metal trade, silver futures were down 0.17% at $16.225 a troy ounce, while platinum futures were little changed at $940.70.\nAmong base metals, copper futures were up 0.53% to $3.018 a pound, up from Monday\u2019s three-month lows of $2.938.\nWorries over recent weak economic data out of China, the world\u2019s largest copper consumer, and concerns over trade tensions had pressured prices to their weakest levels since December after they hit a nearly four-year high late last year.\nRelated Articles\nOil prices rise as OPEC seen continuing supply cuts through 2018\nGold Prices Edge Up as Dollar Heads Lower Despite Bullish GDP Data",

The benchmark S&P 500 Index settled at 2,779.03, up 1.6%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial Average finished at 25,316.53, up 2.8% and the tech-based NASDAQ Composite closed at 7,644.91, up 1.2%.\nSteady interest rates also limited the market\u2019s gains with the 10-year Treasury note yield closing at 2.95%, up 0.04%.\nForecast\nEconomic data will be robust this week, highlighted with May\u2019s inflation report Tuesday, a rate decision from the U.S. Federal Reserve Wednesday, and retail sales Thursday.\nThe Consumer Price Index is expected to show a monthly increase of 0.2%. Core CPI is expected to rise 0.1%. Producer inflation is expected to jump 0.3%, up from April\u2019s 0.1% rise. These reports are not expected to change the outcome of the Fed\u2019s rate decision on Wednesday. The central bank is widely expected to raise its benchmark rate 25 basis points.\nRetail Sales are expected to come in at 0.4%, up from 0.3%. Core Retail Sales are expected to rise 0.3%, matching the previous gain.\nGold traders have fully-priced in the June rate hike. However, there is still some uncertainty over future rate hikes. Traders aren\u2019t sure if there will be one or two more rate hikes after that. Gold traders will be looking for clues about the Fed\u2019s next interest rate moves in the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s Monetary Policy Statement, Economic Projections and Press Conference.\nAs far as Trump\u2019s meeting with Kim Jong-un, it\u2019s too hard to tell how the outcome will influence gold prices. Obviously, if there is a so-called \u201cpeace agreement\u201d then this will diminish gold\u2019s appeal as a safe haven asset. However, I think gold traders will be paying closer attention to the Fed than to the meeting. Once again, the direction of Treasury yields will exert the most influence on the direction of gold prices.",

Here's where things went wrong for Freeport-McMoRan in 2017.\nCorrecting the big mistake\nBack in 2013, when oil and natural gas prices were nearing a peak, Freeport bought two energy companies. The copper and gold miner's goal was to diversify its business by expanding into oil and gas. It sounded like a great plan, since energy prices were holding up better than copper and gold prices at that point. However, within a year of the investment, oil prices started a deep downturn that turned the new business into an albatross.\nImage source: Getty Images\nThe real problem, however, was leverage. Freeport's long-term debt went from roughly $3.5 billion at the start of 2013 to just over $20 billion by the end of it. With oil prices starting a deep descent in mid 2014, the newly acquired energy business started to eat cash that was already tight due to the downturn in the copper and gold sectors. With Freeport having to cover the increased interest expense of that huge leverage expansion, investors started to wonder about the company's future. Interest expenses had tripled between 2012 (before the oil acquisitions) and 2016, a span that saw the company's bottom line go from black ink to red.\nBy the time 2017 began, however, Freeport had started to regain its footing. It was reducing leverage and selling oil and gas assets, an effort helped along by the 2016 recovery in copper and gold prices. Long-term debt fell around 25% in 2016 to roughly $15 billion. The progress on this front continued in 2017, with long-term debt down to $12.5 billion by the end of the third quarter. Couple that with the sale of oil assets over the past couple of years and it would have been reasonable to expect 2017 to be a very good year. In fact, the miner has been posting positive earnings since the third quarter of 2016. The underlying business has, indeed, improved in an important way.\nThe story at a big mine goes awry\nUnfortunately, however, the uncertainties at Freeport weren't over, with a dispute at the giant Grasberg Mine in Indonesia taking center stage in early February. This single mine accounts for roughly 30% of Freeport's copper reserves and virtually all of its gold reserves, clearly an important asset for the miner. Shares sold off sharply on the news.",

Both events helped drive down demand for higher risk assets including U.S. stocks and the U.S. Dollar, while driving up demand for safe-haven gold.\nIn other news, hedge funds and money managers cut their net long position in COMEX gold in the week to April 3 and boosted their net short position in silver to another record, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed on Friday.\nForecast\nWith the dollar trading higher and stocks expected to open stronger, we\u2019re expecting gold to remain under pressure throughout the session. Furthermore, gold changed its trend to down last week on the daily chart which suggests investors may already be giving up on the upside potential of the market.\nFurther supporting the possibility of weakness in the gold market are upbeat comments from President Trump, who predicted on Sunday that China would take down its trade barriers, expressing optimism despite escalating tensions between the nations.\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire",

The United States will look at what North Korea has said independently, and continue to coordinate closely with our allies.\"\nThe Associated Press, citing Yonhap, reported that North Korea is also threatening to cancel the talks with the U.S. because of the joint military exercises.\nThe U.S. State Department said it had not received any information from North Korea about the threat to cancel the June summit between Trump and Kim, Reuters reported.\n\"Kim Jong Un had said previously that he understands the need and the utility of the United States and the Republic of Korea continuing in its joint exercises,\" said Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, in a briefing shortly after the North Korean announcement.\nThe department will continue to plan for the summit, which is currently scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12.\nThe Pentagon defended the military exercises in a statement from Defense Department spokesman U.S. Army Col Rob Manning on Tuesday.\n\"Republic of Korea (ROK) and U.S. military forces are currently engaged in the recurring, annual ROK-U.S. spring exercises, to include exercises Foal Eagle 2018 and Max Thunder 2018. These defensive exercises are part of the ROK-U.S. Alliance's routine, annual training program to maintain a foundation of military readiness. The purpose of the training is to enhance the ROK-U.S. Alliance's ability to defend the ROK and enhance interoperability and readiness. While we will not discuss specifics, the defensive nature of these combined exercises has been clear for many decades and has not changed.\"\nEquity markets, which were already declining, ticked further down briefly following the news, while spot gold prices received a slight boost.\nJust hours earlier, South Korea's Unification Ministry had announced that North Korea had proposed the inter-Korea talks that would have been held Wednesday. The meeting would have included discussions about ending the seven-decade-long Korean war and upholding the pledge to completely denuclearize the peninsula, according to the Unification Ministry.\nNorth Korea said it would destroy its only known nuclear test site between May 23 and 25, weather permitting. The regime has not, however, promised to get rid of its nuclear arsenal .\nThe Pentagon said in March that the U.S. and South Korea's April 1 joint military drills would be conducted on a similar scale to previous years, despite the warming relations with the north. The exercises usually provoke an angry response from North Korea .\nNorth Korea's current threats come in response to the so-called Max Thunder military exercises. The two-week air forces drills, which began on Friday, comprise roughly 100 warplanes, including eight F-22 radar-evading fighters and a number of B-52 bombers and F-15K jets, Yonhap reported.\nThis is a developing story.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who is scheduled to speak in Davos on Thursday, slapped steep tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels on Monday. Mnuchin's comments provided a fresh trigger for dollar selling and raised questions about whether a weaker U.S. currency could provide a long-term impetus for the economy. The dollar index <.DXY>, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, was down 1 percent at 89.198, slipping below 90 for the first time since December 2014. The dollar was down about 1 percent against the yen . \"It's quite significant given that this is the first time in a very long time that a Treasury secretary has spoken against a strong dollar,\" said Sireen Harajli, FX strategist at Mizuho. Gold prices rose, hitting their highest level since August 2016, as investors sought insurance against fears of rising inflation. Spot gold was up 1.4 percent $1,360.23 an ounce. In U.S. stocks, the S&P 500 ended down slightly as Ross' comments fueled worries of a trade war. Stocks were higher early in the session following another round of upbeat earnings and the dollar's fall, which tends to be a positive for U.S. multinationals. Also weighing on the S&P 500, General Electric Co. shares were down 2.7 percent. In the latest blow to the largest U.S. industrial conglomerate, U.S. securities regulators are probing a massive insurance charge that GE announced last week. GE on Wednesday forecast more weakness this year at its power business, which produced 60 percent of company profits as recently as 2016. The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> rose 41.31 points, or 0.16 percent, to 26,252.12, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 1.59 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,837.54, and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 45.23 points, or 0.61 percent, to 7,415.06. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> lost 0.51 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe <.MIWD00000PUS> gained 0.15 percent. U.S. Treasury debt prices slumped, also after Mnuchin's comments. U.S. 30-year bond yields, which move inversely to prices, rose to their highest level in more than three months. In late trading, U.S. 10-year Treasury yields rose to 2.652 percent, from 2.622 percent late on Tuesday. U.S. 30-year bond yields hit a 3-1/2-month peak of 2.956 percent and were last at 2.933 percent, up from 2.902 percent on Tuesday. Oil rallied, lifted by a record 10th straight weekly decline in U.S. crude inventories. U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures settled up $1.14, or 1.8 percent, to $65.80. Brent futures gained 57 cents to $70.53 a barrel. Both benchmarks were at their highest levels since December 2014.

Eldorado does not expect to make any material amendments to the existing EIA as the mill site falls within the EIA approved project boundaries and meets other existing EIA requirements. The installation and construction of the Kisladag mill remains subject to further routine permitting, which will be submitted to the relevant Ministries for approval following detailed design work.\nAs referenced in Eldorado's press release dated March 21, 2018 , the feasibility study for the Kisladag mill is expected to be completed later this year, with a final investment decision by the Eldorado Board of Directors expected shortly thereafter.\nLamaque, Canada\nAs disclosed in the Company's First Quarter results release dated April 26, 2018 , the mining lease for the Triangle deposit was received in early 2018. This key permit enables production from the Triangle deposit, currently expected in early 2019.\nUnderground development continues ahead of schedule while refurbishment of the Sigma mill is ongoing. The Company continues to progress infill drilling and extension drilling with the goal of converting resource to increase the Proven and Probable reserves as well as growing resources at Triangle and other known mineralized zones and new targets.\nKassandra Mines (Skouries, Olympias and Stratoni), Greece\nEldorado continues to discuss the need to approve outstanding permits for the development of its Kassandra assets with the government of Greece. The Company remains committed to developing its Kassandra assets, including Skouries, in accordance with its contractual and other legal obligations, which Greek court rulings have consistently supported. Eldorado's compliance with its legal obligations was confirmed by the recent positive arbitration decision (disclosed on April 4, 2018 ), which found the Company not in breach of the provisions of its Transfer Contract with the Greek State.\nThe transition of the Skouries site to care and maintenance is expected to be complete by the end of Q2 2018. Ongoing care and maintenance costs are estimated to be $3-5 million per year for 2019 and beyond.\nAbout Eldorado Gold\nEldorado is a gold and base metals producer with mining, development and exploration operations in Turkey , Greece , Romania , Serbia, Canada and Brazil. The Company has a highly skilled and dedicated workforce, safe and responsible operations, a portfolio of high-quality assets, and long-term partnerships with local communities.

The Vancouver-based miner is first focused on building Fruta del Norte, which will be Ecuador's biggest gold mine, after raising $1 million in financing over the past year. The start of production is targeted by the end of 2019. The underground mine is expected to operate for 15 years and produce over 325,000 ounces of gold annually, and encompasses six of the company's 29 mining concessions, which cover 70,000 hectares of land. \"We see this as a company-builder,\" Hochstein said, flagging exploration potential and the mine's low production costs. Lying along Latin America's mineral-rich Andean mountain range, Ecuador is drawing interest from dozens of global miners such as BHP and Rio Tinto, Hochstein said. Fruta del Norte was sold for $240 million in 2014 by Kinross Gold, which halted development in 2013 amid falling gold prices and government plans to increase taxes. Last week, Australia's Newcrest Mining said it would pay $250 million to buy a 27.1 percent stake in Lundin Gold. Newcrest spent $40 million last year on a 14.5 stake in Ecuadorean miner SolGold. Newcrest was part of a $400 million equity raise including investments by the Lundin Family Trusts, which holds 22.3 percent, and streaming partner Orion Mine Finance Group, which holds 11.4 percent. To avoid additional debt or shareholder dilution to finance its mine, management discussed partnership options with eight gold companies over the past year, Hochstein said. \"This wasn't a case of bringing in a strategic investor as a take-over. This is a partnership to grow Lundin Gold,\" he said. In an exploration joint venture, Newcrest could operate and earn 50 percent in eight of Lundin Gold's concessions by spending $20 million over five years. For now, Lundin Gold's priority is to show shareholders it can build its mine on time and budget. \"We can't stumble now,\" Hochstein said. (Reporting by Susan Taylor; Editing by Paul Simao)",

Although the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate three times this year, the U.S. Dollar still weakened against a basket of major currencies.

Additionally, throughout the year, the Fed signaled a series of gradual rate hikes and that its cycle of rate hikes might end sooner than planned.\nGold reached a cyclical bottom in early December that could carry over into the new year.

As gold prices started falling, however, it became clear that Barrick couldn't support all its expansion plans and the weight of its hefty debt load. Since then, it has easily done more than its peers to fix its debt overhang. But investors need to be aware of more than just debt reduction when looking at Barrick.\nHistory repeats itself\nCommodity prices tend to be highly cyclical. The pattern is so similar each time that you'd think miners would be able to resist the temptation to overextend themselves. But the so-called animal spirits of the market are a siren call that few can avoid succumbing to. Which is why so many miners, Barrick included, were caught off balance in 2011 when commodity prices started a steep decline.\nImage source: Getty Images\nAt the time, Barrick had big, expensive growth plans in place that it was funding with debt. To put a number on that, the miner's long-term debt roughly tripled between 2009 and 2011. The absolute value topped out at nearly $13.2 billion, representing around 36% of the company's capital structure at the time.\nBut the downturn took a big toll, with losses and asset write-offs over the following years reducing shareholder equity. By the end of 2014, long-term debt had fallen a miserly 3%, but shareholder equity had declined 56%, leaving the company's long-term debt at a troubling 55% of the capital structure.\nPutting a new trend in place\nThat is where this story really begins. Barrick was well aware of its leverage issue and set out to repair its balance sheet. In 2015 alone, it cut its debt load by 23%. It followed that up by trimming long-term debt by another 20% in 2016. And in 2017, long-term debt fell another 18%. Asset sales, cost cutting, and streaming deals, among other things, all played a role in this effort. As of the first quarter of 2018, Barrick had trimmed its long-term debt by a massive 51% since the start of 2015.\nBarrick isn't the only major miner that's been focused on debt reduction. But it has been beating peers like Newmont Mining(NYSE: NEM), Kinross Gold(NYSE: KGC), and Goldcorp(NYSE: GG) on this front, in some cases by a very wide margin. Barrick estimates that the massive balance-sheet effort has saved it around $300 million a year in interest expenses. Long-term debt is now back down to around 30% of the miner's capital structure.\nThings are better, but...\nDuring the heat of the downturn, investors were rightly concerned that heavily indebted miners like Barrick needed to adjust, or they would end up in deep trouble. Barrick's debt reduction efforts and the 2016 upturn in commodity prices have calmed those fears. However, you shouldn't stop thinking about Barrick's balance sheet just yet.\nThe miner professes that it wants to be more prudent in the future than it had been in the past. Which is exactly what you want to hear as an investor. However, past actions speak louder than words. If you own Barrick, you'll want to keep watching to make sure management continues to live up to its fiscally prudent words.\nThat's particularly important when you step back and compare the miner's leverage to peers. Yes, Barrick has been more aggressive in its efforts to trim debt. But even after the massive reduction, it still has a more-leveraged balance sheet than many of its closest competitors. For example, as the chart below shows, financial debt to equity is at the high end compared to some of the world's largest gold miners.\nAnd while Barrick is on sounder footing than Goldcorp with regard to financial debt to EBITDA and the current ratio, it isn't exactly leading the pack when it comes to having a conservative financial structure.\nThat's not to suggest that the miner is at any risk of financial distress today. Far from it, after its successful effort to trim long-term debt (and the rebound in commodity prices). But Barrick's more-aggressive debt reduction was needed. And it shouldn't lead investors to overlook the fact that it is still more highly levered than its peers, which is something of a statement about management's more aggressive business approach.\nThere will be another cycle\nBarrick Gold has done a great job of executing its plans to improve its balance sheet strength. But as I said, it remains more financially leveraged than some of its closest peers. Since the cyclical nature of the mining business that led to Barrick's current debt trimming is going to repeat itself at some point in the future, investors should keep a close eye on the company's financial foundation. Animal spirits are hard to resist, no matter what promises management makes about remaining fiscally prudent the next time around.\nReuben Gregg Brewer has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

No matter the reason, the core thought driving this buying is that gold is valuable and will become even more so in the future due to the many factors that influence the price of gold.\nWe'll explore the many motivations behind investing in gold by looking at some of the worlds biggest gold investors.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nHow much gold is in the world?\nAccording to an estimate by the Word Gold Congress, humans have pulled 187,200 tons of gold from the earth. To put that into perspective, if we melted the gold down and formed it into a cube, it would fit comfortably in the middle of a baseball diamond, which is 90 feet from base to base on each side. While relatively small in size, that cube would be worth a whopping $8 trillion at gold's recent price of around $1,340 an ounce.\nTo further illustrate how rare and valuable gold is, the U.S. Geological Survey estimates that there are about 57,000 tons still in the ground to mine. Dig it up and melt it together, and the cube of additionally available gold would only stand as tall as an adult giraffe.\nEach year the mining industry digs out a little less than 3,500 tons of gold, or roughly 112 million ounces, with the largest supply coming from Barrick Gold at 5.53 million ounces. Meanwhile, another 1,300 tons get recycled each year. That puts the gold market at roughly $170 billion per year, which, for perspective, pales in comparison to the more than $1.7 trillion oil market.\nWhile there is some minor industrial demand for this gold, the bulk of it goes toward jewelry and investment in the form of coins and bars, with the latter often held by gold ETFs as well as the official sector like governments.\nThe biggest gold investor in the world\nThe largest single owner of gold on the planet is the U.S. government. At last count, Uncle Sam had 8,133.5 tons of gold (260 million ounces) stashed in vaults around the country like Fort Knox, which holds 147.3 million ounces. With gold currently around $1,340 an ounce, the country's holdings are worth $350 billion. While that sounds like a lot of money, it would barely put a dent in the $21 trillion national debt, let alone help with the $3.8 trillion annual budget. In fact, liquidating the country's gold stash would barely pay more than a year's worth of interest on the national debt, which was about $230 billion in 2015.\nOverall, the U.S. holds about 5% of the world's gold. That stockpile is more than those of the next three largest gold-holding countries (Germany, Italy, and France) combined.\nA top gold investor worth noting\nWhile the U.S. has the biggest government-controlled gold stash, the largest nongovernment holder of gold is the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which is a group of 189 countries that work together to foster monetary cooperation. The IMF currently holds 2,184 ounces of gold, which puts it between Germany and Italy on the world scale. The IMF has acquired its gold stockpile in several ways. Upon its founding in 1944, the IMF received 25% of its initial quota substitutions in the form of gold and required members to pay a quarter of all subsequent quota increases in gold. In addition to that, member countries can pay interest charges and credit owed to the IMF in gold as well as sell their gold to the organization to acquire the currency of another member.\nThe golden culture\nWhile central banks and other government-related agencies are the largest investors in gold, the majority of the of the precious metal gets transformed into jewelry each year. That industry uses an average of more than 2,000 tons of gold each year, or about $85 billion worth. While Americans have an affinity for gold, their demand pales in comparison to the gold-buying habits of the nation of India. According to several estimates, Indian people collectively hold the greatest amount of gold in the world, calculated at 26,500 tons, or about 850 million ounces, worth roughly $1.1 trillion.\nTwo factors may drive all that gold buying: Diwali and weddings. Diwali is the most important of the Hindu holidays. (According to the most recent census, almost 80% of the Indian population are Hindus.) The five-day Diwali festival often features buying gold, which many Indians see as a status symbol for wealth. Because Indians highly value gold, it is also often a key feature in weddings. Because of these two factors, Indians typically invest more than 8% of their annual income to buy gold each year.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nGoing for the gold\nWhile Indians collectively own the most gold in the world, Germans investors have emerged as the biggest buyers of gold in recent years. Gold demand in the country surged from an average of around 17 tons per year from 1995 to 2007 to more than 100 tons in 2016. Germans started ramping up their gold buying in the aftermath of the financial crisis but have stepped up their gold-buying habits since then due to concerns over the devaluation of the Euro. Because of that, more German retail investors own gold (22%) than bonds (13% corporate and 5% government).\nThe gold standard in gold investments\nWhile Indians tend to buy gold in the form of jewelry and Germans in the way of coins and bars, a growing number of other investors have chosen to invest the precious metal via an ETF, the largest of which is the SPDR Gold Trust(NYSEMKT: GLD).\nThis ETF provides a cost-effective, liquid, transparent, secure, and flexible way for investors to hold gold as opposed to buying, storing, and insuring the physical metal. That's why big-name investors like George Soros and John Paulson have used this vehicle in the past to make bullish gold bets. Paulson's hedge fund once owned more than $1.5 billion of gold via this ETF and mining stocks.\nOne thing investors should know about the SPDR Gold Trust is that it does own physical gold bullion, stored primarily in the London vault of HSBC Bank. As of April 18, 2018, it held 69,300 total gold bars weighing roughly 27.8 million ounces (953 tons), worth about $37 billion.\nThe SPDR Gold Trust is one of several ETFs that hold physical gold in vaults for investors to provide them with an easy, low-cost way to invest in the precious metal. The next largest is iShares Gold Trust(NYSEMKT: IAU) which held roughly $11.6 billion in gold, spread in vaults around the world. What's different about this ETF other than size and the location of its gold are the fees it charges investors, which are 0.25% per year versus 0.40% for the SPDR Gold Trust. Because of those lower fees, the iShares Gold Trust ETF's price has more closely mirrored that of gold over the years:\nSo, while it might not be the biggest investor in the gold market, it appears to be the better option for longer-term investors to consider.\nWhat do most of the world's biggest gold investors have in common?\nWe can broadly group gold investors into two camps: Those holding it to store value and those speculating on its price movement. Gold buyers in India and counties with immense gold reserves fall into the first group. They hold gold because it holds value. Indians invest a significant portion of their income into buying it each year to boost their wealth. Most counties, as well as German investors, hold gold as a security blanket to help protect against currency and stock market fluctuations.\nThe other group of gold buyers wants to profit off the movement in its price. This type includes hedge funds like Paulson's that typically buy ETFs like the SPDR Gold Trust since they can quickly get in and out of that vehicle. That ease of use is why at one point it was the most valuable ETF in the world because speculators poured into the fund as the price of gold rose in hopes of profiting from that momentum. Now, it's not even in the top 10 because gold's shine has diminished as its price has come off the peak.\nShould you invest in gold?\nThe decision to buy gold is often a deeply personal one. Many do so because of the belief that it will hold its value better than a government-backed currency in the coming years due to inflationary fears or other concerns. Others will invest in gold because they believe that it's a sign of wealth. Then there are those who want to speculate that the price of the precious metal will move higher due to any number of catalysts.\nBecause people invest in gold for different reasons, it's important first to know why you want to buy it. If buying gold will help you sleep more soundly at night or fulfill a deep cultural or personal desire, then, by all means, feel free to buy it. Meanwhile, if you see catalysts on the horizon that should send its price higher, then a gold ETF is worth considering. However, if you're looking for an investment that will grow your wealth over the long term, gold probably isn't the best option.\nMatthew DiLallo has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

This myth can be dispelled by looking at one chart: Long term interest rates.\nAs you can see from the chart above, 10-year rates skyrocketed from 1962 to just before 1982 to record highs so high that they would be unimaginable today. From 1971 to 1980 though, just before rates peaked, the price of gold \"pulled a bitcoin\" so to speak, rushing from $35 to $873 an ounce in January 1980. The gold bull market of 1971-1980 was more intense than the gold bull market from 2000-2011 by percentage. And it happened during the most sustained and intense environment of rising interest rates.\nSo no, rising rates are not necessarily bad for gold. They are only bad for gold when rates are rising due to increased demand for cash or a decreased supply of cash or both. If, however, they are rising because the Federal Reserve is trying to combat rising consumer prices and inflation, then rising rates are great for gold, because it means that the Fed has lost control of the dollar, at least temporarily. This is when gold really shines. Nominal rates don't matter. What matters is inflation.\nMyth #2: Rising Rates are Good for the Dollar\nThis second myth can be true sometimes, even most of the time, but not always. Rising rates can cure a falling dollar only if said rates can actually be paid. If they cannot, more dollars must be printed and the dollar will fall in the face of rising rates. Imagine what would happen if the Fed announced a new round of quantitative easing because the government was having trouble finding buyers for Treasuries. Treasuries would collapse and so would the dollar.\nThe Federal government being unable to pay its obligations without the Fed has not happened yet, but it can, especially considering that annual federal deficits are now projected to be over $1 trillion through the end of this decade with no significant shrinkage on the horizon.",

Later this year, Kibali will move from underground mining by contractors to owner-mining, as has already happened at Randgold's Loulo mines in Mali.\nKibali ranks as one of the most automated underground gold mines in Africa and the third-largest open-stoping gold mine in the world. Bristow noted that it represented an investment of more than $2.7 billion over an eight-year period, demonstrating the importance of providing investors in a long-term industry such as mining with reliable tax and fiscal stability guarantees.\n\"The investment in Kibali was motivated by the stability provision in the 2002 mining code, which in our view has been triggered by the recent promulgation of the 2018 code. We trust we shall be able to reach consensus on this issue with the government, which we believe is critical to future investment in the country,\" he said.\nDespite challenges, Kibali remains committed to advancing the development of its remote region and continues to invest in the employment and upskilling of local people. More than 90% of its employees are Congolese nationals, and so far this year it has spent almost $50 million with local contractors. Over the total project period, this totaled $1.6 billion.\nInquiries:\n| Mark Bristow Graham Shuttleworth | Willem Jacobs Cyrille Mutombo | Kathy du Plessis Website: |\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nExcept for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this news release are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the US Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and applicable Canadian securities legislation.

The drop in the U.S. also filtered through to Asia and Europe.\nTraders were looking ahead to a final revision of U.S. fourth quarter growth and data on pending home sales later in the day.\nIndications last week that the Federal Reserve is likely to stick to its plan for gradual interest rates increases and is still projecting three rate hikes this year have supported gold, which struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets when interest rates rise.\nIn other precious metal trade, silver futures were down 0.49% at $16.460 a troy ounce, while platinum futures shed 0.65% to trade at $946.10.\nAmong base metals, copper futures were down 0.65% to $2.981 a pound.\nPrices have fallen almost 9% so far this year after hitting a nearly four-year high in December, pressured lower by weak economic data out of China, the world\u2019s largest copper consumer, and worries about trade tensions.\nRelated Articles",

A celebration of good triumphing over evil, the festival typically coincides with the Hindu new year. Regular readers of Frank Talk should know that Diwali is also an auspicious time to buy gold coins and jewelry as gifts for loved ones, and in the past the increased demand has been enough to move gold prices to the upside.\nThis year, however, demand for coins and jewelry was muted leading up to the fall festival on account of a weaker rupee relative to the U.S. dollar. This made the precious metal less affordable for some buyers. By the end of October, gold prices were at their highest level since September 2013, according to Reuters. Gold ordinarily goes for a premium in anticipation of Diwali, but this year many retailers reported trying to attract customers by offering discounts.\nAnd there could be more rupee pain ahead. In a recent note to investors, UBS forecast that the Indian currency will likely remain under pressure as global oil prices stay elevated. India is a net importer of crude oil, which has risen more than 20 percent in the 12-month period, thanks to supply disruptions in Venezuela, Libya and elsewhere.\nU.S. sanctions on major oil state Iran\u2014India\u2019s third largest supplier of crude following Iraq and Saudi Arabia\u2014have also lifted prices. Those sanctions went into effect this week.\nIndia\u2019s Economy to Grow Faster Than China\u2019s\nNevertheless, India\u2019s economy is advancing at the world\u2019s fastest pace right now. I believe this should have a positive effect on gold demand in the long term as the size of the country\u2019s middle class expands. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently predicted the Indian economy this year to grow 7.3 percent, or 0.7 percentage points over China\u2019s anticipated growth rate and an incredible 2.6 percentage points over emerging and developing economies on average. Next year India is expected to grow even faster, at 7.4 percent.\nWhat\u2019s more, India\u2019s billionaire wealth increased 36 percent in 2017, according to a recent report by UBS. The number of billionaires in India rose by 19 to 119 in total. Again, I expect this to have a noticeable impact on gold demand, the greater this wealth builds.\nCurious to learn more about Diwali?

        "full_text": "Gold hits 1-month high as weaker dollar lifts commodities\nBy Jan Harvey\nLONDON (Reuters) - Gold hit a one-month high on Thursday, rallying for a ninth straight session as a retreat in the dollar on the back of lower U.S. bond yields drove gains in commodities priced in the currency.\nThe metal is also benefiting from technically driven momentum after closing above its 100-day moving average on Wednesday for the first time since late November, analysts said.\nSpot gold was up 0.5 percent at $1,293.73 an ounce at 1450 GMT, having earlier touched its highest since Nov. 29 at $1,294.95 an ounce. U.S. gold futures for February delivery were up $4.80 an ounce at $1,296.20.\n\"The weakness in the dollar is playing its part,\" Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets, said. \"We do think that this trend will continue into 2018. We expect the gold price to finish the year above $1,300 mark, and that would send a strong buy signal for traders.\"\nThe dollar held near a one-month low versus a currency basket on Thursday as the latest jobless claims data suggesting a firm labour market was offset by advance trade balance figures that pointed to a widening trade gap in November.\nThat helped drive gains across commodities, with benchmark Brent crude oil futures near their highest since mid 2015, and copper at a four-year peak.\nThe dollar index is down more than 9 percent so far this year, and is on course for its biggest annual loss since 2003.\nA weakening dollar has helped lift gold nearly 5 percent from the near five-month low of $1,235.92 it hit in mid-December. Its rise has picked up further momentum in the last week from positive technical factors, analysts said.\n\"(The rally) has seen gold march up and close at the 100-day moving average in yet another positive technical development,\" currency broker OANDA said in a note.\n\"With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) still at neutral levels, the technical picture suggests there is still potential topside in this rally.\"\nElsewhere, net gold imports to major consumer China via main conduit Hong Kong fell 23.6 percent in November from the previous month, data showed on Thursday.\nMore in News\nAmong other precious metals, silver was 0.7 percent higher at $16.80 an ounce after earlier hitting its highest since late November at $16.82. Holdings of silver exchange-traded funds tracked by Reuters ticked up to their highest since early September, with Thursday's data showing a 62-tonne inflow.\nPlatinum was up 0.9 percent at $925 an ounce. Palladium was down 0.1 percent at $1,059.74 an ounce, having touched its highest since February 2001 at $1,069.50 on Wednesday.\n(Additional reporting by Apeksha Nair and Nallur Sethuraman in Bengaluru; Editing by David Evans and Mark Potter)",

And the decision by OPEC and Russia to take an extra 1m barrels of oil per day out of the ground adds to the likelihood of this material overflow coming back sooner rather than later.\nRight now City analysts are expecting Shell to deliver a 77% earnings increase in 2018, and to keep the full-year dividend locked at 188 US cents per share.\nA low forward P/E ratio of 12.7 times and a chunky dividend yield of 5.2% may be enough to tempt new investment in the fossil fuel leviathan. But my worries concerning booming production in the years ahead, allied to Shell\u2019s modest exposure to renewable energy sources, still discourage me from buying the stock today.\nHigh risk\nThe same concerns are deterring me from splashing the cash on UK Oil & Gas Investments (LSE: UKOG), you probably won\u2019t be surprised to hear.\nThe company is an even riskier selection than Shell though, of course \u2014 it currently has no income to offset the colossal cost of dragging its considerable oil reserves out of the ground. UKOG has raised funds via share placings in recent weeks to continue testing work at its core assets like Horse Hill in Surrey, but given the rate of cash burn, further cash-raising efforts could be just around the corner.\nOn top of this, flow testing figures from the project have so far been underwhelming. And further disappointing results from upcoming tests would prompt a fresh exodus of investors, such is the volatility associated with investment in small-cap oil explorers.\nUKOG clearly has plenty of promise but that is all it has right now. In my opinion the risks continue to overshadow the potential rewards at this stage.\nMore reading\n- Top shares for June\n- Can the Lloyds share price reach 100p in 2018?\n- 5 shares to retire on\n- Retirement saving: five habits of millionaire investors\n- Want to retire at 55?

Young and Peter Hobson\nNEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Gold prices on Thursday approached a four-month high set on the previous day after minutes of a European Central Bank meeting showed a more aggressive tone and boosted the euro against the U.S. dollar.\nThe December meeting minutes said the central bank should revisit its policy message in early 2018 and gradually adjust its language to reflect improved growth prospects.\n\"The euro gained against the dollar after the minutes from the ECB's December meeting showed a hawkish tone,\" said John Lawrence, a senior trader at Heraeus Precious Metals in New York.\nInvestors would probably take a policy message change as a sign that rate-setters may begin to wind down their 2.55-trillion-euro bond-buying programme.\nA stronger euro potentially boosts demand for gold by making dollar-priced bullion cheaper for European investors.\nThe dollar (.DXY) weakened more broadly after U.S. data showed a rise in jobless claims and a decrease in producer prices, making gold cheaper for other non-U.S. buyers.\nDaniel Ghali, commodities strategist at TD Securities in Toronto, said he had been expecting a lower dollar.\n\"The U.S. is set to tighten their quantitative easing, but other central banks around the world are going to play catch up,\" he said. \"That should sap some strength out of the dollar during the year.\"\nSpot gold (XAU=) was up 0.5 percent at $1,322.74 an ounce by 1:37 p.m. EST (1837 GMT) after touching $1,326.56 on Wednesday, the highest since Sept. 15.\nMore in News\nU.S. gold futures (GCcv1) for February delivery settled up $3.20, or 0.2 percent, at $1,322.50 per ounce.\nThe weaker dollar has helped gold rally by more than $80 from its mid-December low, but it will struggle to rise much further in the short term, said Saxo Bank analyst Ole Hansen.\nSeveral other factors were supporting gold prices, including a dip in global equities following a spectacular rally, and a rise in industrial metals that will increase the cost of goods and services.\n\"People are starting to pick up on gold as a hedge,\" Ghali said. \"There might be a growing community of people that are worried about an equity correction.\"Among other precious metals, spot silver (XAG=) was up 0.1 percent at $16.96 an ounce from a two-week low of $16.86 on Wednesday.\nPlatinum (XPT=) was up 1.31 percent at $983.70 an ounce after hitting $985.10, its highest since Sept. 15.\nPalladium (XPD=) rose 0.2 percent to $1,084.60 an ounce after touching a nine-day low of $1,075.50.\n(Additional reporting by Nallur Sethuraman in Bengaluru; Editing by Mark Potter and Lisa Von Ahn)",

Gold traded higher, despite the fact that yields across the curve moved higher. Lower demand for higher-risk assets also helped support gold prices.

Unfortunately, the resistance was too great and the bears were in control of the market at this point, on the back of the astounding rise in Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies. Gold then tumbled back down to $1,245, at 2).\nCryptos, Bitcoin, in particular, were taking their first blows at this point, with several governments, China and South Korea, being the most prominent, saying they would be clamping down on the mining and exchange operations in both countries.

The 21-day EMA (blue line) at 5) is tracking sharply upwards again \u2013 and there is a healthy gap between it and the gold price. This will be the first point of support in any retrace. The 55-day and 100-day EMAs are also beginning to turn upwards \u2013 again, consolidating any support which results from a retrace, at 6).\nIn terms of indicators, the 14-day ADX, at 7) remains strong and above the positive 14-day DI, at 8). This, in turn, is showing steady, strong, performance, and remains several points above the negative 14-day DI, at 9. This is the perfect combination for a continued rally.\nThe momentum indicator, at 10) turned into positive territory on 2nd January, and has steadily climbed to its current level, at 11) showing a high, positive bar.\nSo \u2013 what does all this tell us? Gold has seen a sudden resurgence in its price. As yet there is nothing to show a sudden, or immediate downturn. There is strong support at the moment, and the bulls seem to be in charge. After every such rally, there is always a retrace \u2013 and although there are no signs of this at the moment, it is important to keep an eye on the news and the charts for any signals which would start such a retracement.",

If there is a near-term correction then its retracement zone at $1336.70 to $1330.20 will become the primary downside target.\nThe main range is $1242.70 to $1370.50. Its retracement zone at $1306.60 to $1291.50 remains the major support.\nDaily Swing Chart Forecast\nTrader reaction to the outside move on Friday is likely to determine the direction of the market on Monday.\nA trade through $1364.40 will indicate the presence of buyers. Overtaking $1370.50 will mean the buying is getting stronger. This move could create the upside momentum needed to challenge $1373.30, $1382.20 and $1396.20.\nTaking out Friday\u2019s low at $1347.30 will indicate the presence of sellers. This could lead to a full-short-term retracement into $1336.70 to $1330.20.\nThe direction of the gold market will continue to be influenced by the movement in the U.S. Dollar. Additional pressure could come from a reaction to rising U.S. Treasury yields and increased demand for higher risk assets.\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire",

We've been seeing this pattern (of gold following the dollar) because there's no other strong factor leading to buying gold now,\" said Bill O\u2019Neill, co-founder of Logic Advisors.\nThe U.S. dollar index (.DXY) relinquished its gains and fell against a basket of currencies, making commodities priced in the greenback cheaper for buyers using other currencies.\nAlso weighing on the dollar was news that U.S. consumer prices cooled in February, the latest indication that an expected pick-up in inflation is likely to be only gradual.\nSome investors had been worried stronger-than-expected CPI data could stoke expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise interest rates four times rather than three this year.\nHigher interest rates typically make gold less attractive since it does not bear interest.\n\"Overall the outlook is not looking that great in the short term. I still expect prices to go towards $1,300, said Georgette Boele, ABN AMRO commodity strategist.\nMore in News\nMarkets are looking to the next Fed meeting for direction on the pace of U.S. interest rate hikes this year.\n\"As we approach next week's FOMC day, we should see gold come under pressure as it struggles to compete against interest-bearing assets,\" said Daniel Ghali, commodities strategist at TD Securities.\nSilver (XAG=) rose 0.6 percent at $16.59 an ounce.\nPlatinum (XPT=) was up 0.4 percent at $966.60 an ounce, near a one-week high of $970.90. Palladium (XPD=) climbed 1.7 percent to $995.30 per ounce, after touching a one-week high of $997.40.\nThe platinum price will struggle to move back above palladium, ING analyst Oliver Nugent said in a note.\n\"Based on our own forecasts, we don't think such a move will happen for the next few years due to platinum's weaker fundamentals with the palladium backwardation actually making it more expensive for investors to short the ratio.\"\nThe platinum/palladium ratio increased from late February. Palladium flipped to a premium over platinum last September for the first time since 2001.\n(Additional reporting by Nithin Prasad and Eileen Soreng in Bengaluru, and Marcy Nicholson in New York; Editing by David Goodman and Richard Chang)",

With both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 rattling off record-setting points, investor sentiment is obviously strong. In this scenario, one can almost get away with picking random names from hot-running S&P sectors.\nHowever, with so many extraordinary events, a typical stand-out performance seems rather mundane.

A brash, former reality TV star, and a full-time soundbite, Trump broke every single rule in politics. Yet when the odds were most stacked against him, the mogul found a way to stun everyone.\nPresident Trump\u2019s policies and agendas will reverberate for years to come. Even if he loses the 2020 election, his administration has given a voice to the \u201cdisenfranchised majority.\u201d Perhaps Trump\u2019s greatest gift was to boost the political currency of the white working class. Suddenly, jobs that the mainstream didn\u2019t care about (hello, coal!) took front and center stage.\nHowever, Trump didn\u2019t have a Midas touch for every challenge he encountered. His administration might go down as the most contested in U.S. history. Still, those that have doubted him have been proven wrong at every turn. The record-breaking Dow Jones is a testament to the unmistakable power of the \u201cTrump card.\u201d\nCertainly, it has been a tough year to digest. Here are the top stock market trends of 2017!\nStock Market Trends: The Hated Bull Market Still Gets No Love\nSource: Shutterstock\nThe election victory of President Trump was a complete shocker for Democrats. In their view, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had extensive government experience; based on pure probabilities, Clinton was the safe choice. When the futures market slumped after Trump\u2019s victory was apparent, the left surely felt justified in their candidate of choice.\nIndeed, declining investor sentiment was one of the stock market trends of 2017 that was predicted by many analysts should Trump prove victorious. Naturally, a vast number of Americans were jittery about what a Trump administration entailed. Nevertheless, the Dow Jones shrugged off those fears. The benchmark index gained nearly 8% between election day and December close.\nJanuary suffered a flat performance, giving one last bit of hope for bitter bears. But come February, the Dow Jones was seemingly hitting record points after record points. Year-to-date, the index is up 19%. Rather than a meltdown, we\u2019re experiencing a \u201cmelt-up.\u201d\nHowever, this secular bull market wasn\u2019t all glitter and roses. Primarily, fund managers experienced difficulties justifying their existence. If buying an exchange-traded fund tracking the broader markets could net double-digit returns, individual stock picking had to be phenomenal.\nBusiness-media pundits are correct: this is the most hated bull market. And those that tried to bet against it have so far been burned, badly.\nStock Market Trends: Virtually Every S&P Sector Is a Winner\nSource: Shutterstock\nIf we look back from the future, 2017 may well be regarded as the year when a record number of stock-market \u201cgurus\u201d were born. As previously mentioned, the Dow Jones is melting-up, creating conflation between a superior strategy and plain luck. So long as you were bullish, the odds were extremely stacked in your favor.\nEight out of the nine S&P sectors are well into the black over a trailing one-year period. Only the Energy Select Sector SPDR (ETF) (NYSEARCA:XLE) is the sole loser. Quite literally, you could take a dart-throwing monkey or take wild shots in the dark: with sector ETFs and other broad-focused funds, you were much more likely to win than to lose.\nMany of the S&P sectors had justifiable explanations and arguments. For instance, the top-flyer in 2017 is the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLK). Over the trailing year, the XLK is up 36%, while on a YTD basis, it has gained nearly 33%. Powerhouse companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) make up the XLK\u2019s top holdings.\nOther S&P sectors jumped due to politics. The Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLI) responded very positively to Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d message. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLF) also found confidence in the White House\u2019s pro-business approach.\nHowever, I caution against being cavalier come 2018. That all S&P sectors are winning, and winning \u201cbigly,\u201d is rare. At some point, we\u2019re going to experience a correction.\nStock Market Trends: Gold Did Not Glitter\nSource: Shutterstock\nIf you have ever watched conspiracy related programming (think Alex Jones\u2019 Infowars), you\u2019ll notice that gold bullion plays a significant role. Long story short, most conspiracy theorists assert that the U.S. Federal Reserve is out to deliberately destroy the dollar. Once the greenback is out of the way, a new globalist reserve currency will be ushered in; hence, buy gold.\nMany doomsday-bunker types bought gold in droves during President Obama\u2019s administration. Although everyday folks may find such actions laughable, to the \u201cdoomers,\u201d it makes perfect sense. I\u2019m not here to start a debate, but what I was intrigued about prior to the 2016 election was what would happen to gold prices if we had a Commander-in-Chief that believed in this stuff?\nAfter all, Trump agreed to an interview with Alex Jones, which was absolutely stunning on so many levels. This is the same Alex Jones that publicly cries that \u201c9/11 was an inside job.\u201d Ordinary politicians would be crucified for such a move. Trump became President of the United States.\nHowever, for gold prices, it was largely for naught. Although the yellow metal did have a solid year (up 12.2% year-to-date), it simply failed the doom-and-gloomers\u2019 expectations. The explanation is that gold swings on the fear trade, not the greed trade. Obviously, the Dow Jones rising to all-time records didn\u2019t help matters.\nAlso, conspiracy theorists are caught in between a rock and a hard place. They want gold prices to rise, but they also want this President to succeed. Based on historical market dynamics, these are mutually exclusive phenomenon.\nWatch this space in 2018: it will be very intriguing how this develops!\nStock Market Trends: Bitcoin Destroyed All\nWe can debate all we want about the Dow Jones, individual S&P sectors, or the gold market. Undoubtedly, the biggest winner of 2017 by a country mile is Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency markets. Late last year, Bitcoin was trading near the $1,000 level. At the same time, the Dow Jones was flirting with the 20,000 point level.\nAs I mentioned in January, Bitcoin hit its milestone before the Dow. And while the venerable index added more than 3,000 points since its achievement, Bitcoin added more than $8,600. It\u2019s quite literally the biggest investment of this generation, and may become the biggest of all time. At this rate, the psychological momentum is so strong that $10,000 seems like a foregone conclusion.\nOf course, at such an elevated price point, many are calling Bitcoin a bubble. Some day, the critics will be right. For now, I anticipate a war: will Bitcoin become a trillion-dollar currency before Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) becomes a trillion-dollar company?\nIt may seem like a ridiculous proposition. However, unlike most other bubbles, Bitcoin is built on an emerging technology. The future of financial transactions will use a blockchain architecture similar to what we see in the original cryptocurrency. The same cannot be said about tulip bulbs or Beanie Babies.\nMake no doubt about it: Bitcoin is the most important among the stock market trends of 2017. While it\u2019s not legally a security, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies have the potential to upend the comparatively antiquated Dow Jones.",

(TSX-V: PX; OTC PINK: PGXPF) (''Pelangio'' or the ''Company'') announces a non-brokered private placement of up to 24,000,000 units of the Company at a price of $0.05 per unit for gross proceeds of up to $1,200,000 (the ''Private Placement''). Each unit consists of one common share of the Company (a ''Common Share'') and one Common Share purchase warrant (''Warrant''). Each Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Common Share at a price of $0.07 for a period of three years from the initial closing date of the Private Placement (each closing date, a ''Closing Date'').\nThe closing of the Private Placement may occur in one or more tranches, with the initial Closing Date of the Private Placement expected to occur on or before December 15, 2017, and is not subject to receipt of a minimum amount of gross proceeds. The Company may pay finder's fees of 8% cash and 8% warrants to certain introducing parties in respect of the Private Placement, subject to compliance with applicable securities legislation and TSX Venture Exchange policies. Closing is subject to receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. The securities issued pursuant to the Private Placement, will be subject to a four-month hold period in accordance with applicable Canadian securities laws.\nAppointment of David K. Paxton\nPelangio is also pleased to announce the appointment of David K. Paxton to the Board of Directors. The appointment is effective December 4, 2017.\nMr. Paxton brings over 30 years of combined experience in the mining industry and capital markets. Mr. Paxton currently serves on the boards of two companies in the natural resource sector and has had extensive exposure to financial markets. David has recently held positions as Chief Executive Officer of Vatukoula Gold Mines, a publically listed gold mining company with operations in Fiji, and Chief Executive Officer of Sumin Resources, a private gold exploration company operating in Suriname, South America. Mr. Paxton is a mining engineer and holds a South African Mine Managers Certificate. David has gained vast experience in overseeing mining operations during his involvement in the South African and international mining industry. David's cumulative experience as a Senior Mining Analyst for a Hichens Harrison & Co. PLC, and other significant roles at Union Capital Markets, Sectram Limited PLC, C.M. Oliver (UK) Ltd, Yorkton Securities Inc., and Ed Hern, Rudolf Inc., has proven successful to numerous financings for junior mining companies, both Canadian and United Kingdom based. David is currently a non-executive director of Kalahari Copper Ltd.\n''David brings to Pelangio demonstrated mining operations experience and vast knowledge of the natural resource capital markets. We believe his combined experience will support our planned $2 million drill program at our Manfo Property, the first phase of which is currently underway'' commented Pelangio Exploration's President and Chief Executive Officer, Ingrid Hibbard.\nAlso, Pelangio reports that Mr. Philip Olson has stepped down as a director of the Company, effective immediately and will continue to provide valuable advice and guidance as a member of the Company's Advisory Committee. Mr Olson has been an independent director and a member of the Company's Audit and Compensation Committees since February 2008. Kevin Thomson a director of the Company, will replace Mr. Olson as a member of the Audit Committee and Compensation Committees.\nIngrid Hibbard also remarked, ''On behalf of the Board and management of the Company, I would like express our gratitude to Philip for his valuable contributions and dedication to Pelangio. We look forward to an ongoing relationship with him and appreciate his continued support through the Advisory Committee.''\nManfo Drilling Program\nPelangio also reports that the reconnaissance portion of the initial phase of the exploration program announced on October 11, 2017, is underway.\nThe full exploration program is a $2,000,000 multi-phase exploration program targeting the existing mineralized structures and the newly identified belt bounding structures. The objectives of this program are to locate new mineralized zones, follow up on discovery areas, as well as some limited resource development. This program is expected to test approximately 40 target areas utilizing air core (''AC''), rotary air blast (''RAB''), reverse circulation drilling (''RC''), and diamond drilling as funds become available.\nSeven AC drill fences have been completed to date. The first 5 of 15 AC drill fences were designed to test the belt bounding structure called the Eastern Trend, located some 2 km to the east of the main gold bearing zones. Targets on the untested Eastern Trend were to test strong magnetic lows with coincident pole-dipole IP response, well outside the known mineralized zones. Assays from five fences returned no significant results, with assays for the other two fences forthcoming. The next AC fences will be near the southern property boundary where recent unregulated artisanal disturbed rock and soil spoils are currently being sampled. The next phase of AC drilling and RC drilling will concentrate on the Nkansu area and the Pokukrom East area (host of the maiden mineral resource estimate).\nRosCan Agreement\nAn extension of the terms of the earn-in agreement to jointly advance Pelangio's Dormaa property has been granted by Pelangio to RosCan Minerals Corporation. The 3,000 metre RC/AC drill program has been delayed by the continuing engagement program with the traditional authorities and all appropriate government officials. RosCan's remaining payments pursuant to the agreement have been extended and are now as follows:\n(a) fund $1,700,000 in exploration expenditures, as follows:\nAmount\nDue Date\n$700,000\nBy June 5, 2018; and,\n$1,000,000\nBy June 5, 2019.\n(b) pay to Pelangio an aggregate of $150,000, as follows:\nAmount\nDue Date\n$50,000\nOn June 5, 2018; and,\n$100,000\nOn June 5, 2019\nAbout Pelangio\nPelangio successfully acquires and explores camp-sized land packages in world-class gold belts.

The hearing for the Sanction Order was scheduled for March 16, 2018, but will be postponed to a date to be scheduled. Should the Sanction Order be granted, the intention is to proceed to implement the Recapitalization Plan by March 31, 2018, subject to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent to implementation contained in the Recapitalization Plan.\nA copy of the Recapitalization Plan and materials related thereto are available on the Monitor's website at http://cfcanada.fticonsulting.com/banro/ and on SEDAR.\nBanro Corporation is a Canadian gold mining company focused on production from the Twangiza and Namoya mines, which began commercial production in September 2012 and January 2016 respectively.

These forward-looking statements reflect the current expectations or beliefs of the Company based on information currently available to the Company. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause the actual results of the Company to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements, and even if such actual results are realized or substantially realized, there can be no assurance that they will have the expected consequences to, or effects on the Company. Factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from current expectations include, among other things, the possibility that the Company will be unable to implement the restructuring. In addition, actual results or events could differ materially from current expectations due to instability in the eastern DRC where the Company's mines are located; political developments in the DRC; uncertainties relating to the availability and costs of financing or other appropriate strategic transactions; uncertainty of estimates of capital and operating costs, production estimates and estimated economic return of the Company's projects; the possibility that actual circumstances will differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the economic studies of the Company's projects; failure to establish estimated mineral resources and mineral reserves (the Company's mineral resource and mineral reserve figures are estimates and no assurance can be given that the intended levels of gold will be produced); fluctuations in gold prices and currency exchange rates; inflation; gold recoveries being less than expected; changes in capital markets; lack of infrastructure; failure to procure or maintain, or delays in procuring or maintaining, permits and approvals; lack of availability at a reasonable cost or at all, of plants, equipment or labour; inability to attract and retain key management and personnel; changes to regulations affecting the Company's activities; the uncertainties involved in interpreting drilling results and other geological data; and the other risks disclosed under the heading \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in the Company's annual report on Form 20-F dated April 2, 2017 filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and EDGAR at www.sec.gov.

The FS demonstrates a significant economic and operational improvement compared to the Pre-feasibility Study (\"PFS\") results announced in February of this year. The FS will be used to support an application for a mining concession in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nPROJECT HIGHLIGHTS (100% BASIS)\n- Proven and Probable Reserves (\"P&P\") increased by 0.51 million ounces to 1.93 million ounces grading 1.71 g/t Au versus the P&P Reserves from the PFS\n- Indicated Resources (including Reserves) of 2.49 million ounces grading 1.61 g/t Au\n- Mine Life of 12.8 years with mill throughput of 2.75 million tonnes per annum\n- Life of Mine (\"LOM\") average annual production of 140,000 ounces, averaging 160,000 ounces annually during the first six years\n- LOM cash costs of $714 /oz and all-in sustaining costs of $753 /oz\n- After-tax Internal Rate of Return of 23%, with a payback period of 3.4 years\n- Net Present Value of $261 million (6% discount rate) at a gold price of $1,250 /oz\n- Initial capital expenditures of $254 million\nSteve Letwin , President and CEO of IAMGOLD, said \" Boto Gold has evolved from a grass roots exploration discovery to a robust development project with nearly 2 million ounces in reserves. I congratulate the team for their success in improving the project economics by as much as they have. The 23% after-tax IRR and the 151% increase in the NPV at a lower gold price assumption are marked improvements from those reported in the pre-feasibility study. This is a solid, low-cost project which is expected to deliver 140,000 ounces annually, on average, for nearly 13 years. While a final investment decision is yet to be made, and there is still permitting work to be done, we're looking at a high-value project that adds to IAMGOLD's already impressive growth profile.\"\nThe FS was completed jointly by IAMGOLD and Lycopodium Minerals Canada Ltd (\"Lycopodium\"), with inputs from technical studies completed by Specialist Consultants. The FS represents a comprehensive study of the technical and economic viability of a mineral project that has advanced to a stage where a preferred mining method is established and an effective method of mineral processing is determined.\nA technical report summarizing the FS will be filed on SEDAR tomorrow.\nFS HIGHLIGHTS (100% BASIS)\nProject Economics and Key Parameters | ||\nMining Capacity | 18.2 Mtpa | |\nMilling Capacity | 2.75 Mtpa | |\nLOM Average Annual Gold Production | 140,000 oz | |\nLOM Average Recovery Rate | 89.5% | |\nMine Life | 12.8 years | |\nLOM Average Total Cash Costs | $714/oz | |\nLOM Average AISC | $753/oz | |\nAverage Grade | 1.71 g/t Au | |\nAverage LOM Strip Ratio | 5.8:1 | |\nEstimated Capital Expenditure | ||\nInitial Capital | $254 million | |\nSustaining Capital | $66 million | |\nGold Price Assumption used in financial analysis | $1,250/oz | |\nAfter-tax NPV (6%) | $261 million | |\nAfter-tax IRR | 23.0% | |\nPayback Period | 3.4 years |\n\u20ac/US$ exchange rate of 1:1.20; Oil price of $75 per barrel\nMINERAL RESOURCES\nThe Mineral Resource estimate used as the basis for the study is summarized below.\nMineral Resource Statement \u2013 May 8, 2018 | ||||\nClassification | Tonnes (000) | Grade (g/t Au) | Contained | Attributable Contained Ounces (000) |\nIndicated | 48,045 | 1.61 | 2,487 | 2,238 |\nInferred | 2,483 | 1.80 | 144 | 130 |\nNotes: | |\n1. | CIM Definition Standards were followed for classification of Mineral Resources. |\n2. | Mineral Resources are inclusive of Mineral Reserves. |\n3. | Cut-off grades used to report mineral resources vary from 0.37 g/t Au and 0.51 g/t Au depending on alteration profile. |\n4. | Mineralized Resources are reported within optimized constraining shells. |\n5. | Mineral Resources are estimated using a long-term gold price of $1,500 per ounce. |\n6. | Attributable is a representation of dividends calculated as 90% for IAMGOLD, with 10% to the government of Senegal. |\nMINERAL RESERVES\nThe tonnes, grades, and classification of the Mineral Reserves captured within the FS mine plan are summarized below.\nMineral Reserve Statement - Aug 30, 2018 | ||||\nClassification | Tonnes (000) | Grade (g/t Au) | Contained (000) | Attributable (000) |\nProbable | 35,060 | 1.71 | 1,926 | 1,733 |\nProven & Probable | 35,060 | 1.71 | 1,926 | 1,733 |\nWaste within Designed Pit | 204,335 | |||\nTotal Tonnage within Designed Pit | 239,397 |\nNotes: | |\n1. | CIM Definition Standards were followed for classification of Mineral Reserves. |\n2. | Reserves estimated assuming open pit mining methods. |\n3. | Reserves are based on a gold price of $1,200/oz. |\n4. | Cut-off grades varied between 0.46 g/t Au and 0.63 g/t Au depending on alteration profile and pit area. |\n5. | Average process recovery of 89.5%. |\n6. | Mining costs ($/t processed): $13.01/t.

Maximum mining rate is 33 Mt per annum. The average ore grade is 1.71 g/t Au and the LOM stripping ratio is 5.8:1.\nFuture Work\nThe FS will be used to support an application for a mining concession to be submitted in the fourth quarter of 2018, with approval expected in the first half of 2019. In the interim, the project team will continue to optimize aspects of the project design and complete an infrastructure condemnation drilling program. The exploration team has worked to consolidate additional exploration concessions near the Boto Gold Project, and will conduct ongoing exploration to expand resources in proximity to the resource pits, and identify and evaluate high priority exploration targets for additional mineral resources.\nQualified Persons\nThe FS was prepared by IAMGOLD and Lycopodium and incorporates the work of IAMGOLD, Lycopodium and Specialist Consultants Qualified Persons (QPs) (as defined under National Instrument 43-101).

These standards differ significantly from the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Mineral Resources which are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.\nThis document contains \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of Canadian securities legislation and \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This information and these statements, referred to herein as \"forward-looking statements\" are made as of the date of this document. Forward-looking statements relate to future events or future performance and reflect current estimates, predictions, expectations or beliefs regarding future events and include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to:\n(i) the estimated amount and grade of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves;\n(ii) the FS representing a viable development option for the Project;\n(iii) estimates of the capital costs of constructing mine facilities and bringing a mine into production, of sustaining capital and the duration of financing payback periods;\n(iv) the estimated amount of future production, both produced and metal recovered; and,\n(v) estimates of operating costs and total costs, net cash flow, net present value and economic returns from an operating mine.\nAny statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions, expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives or future events or performance (often, but not always, using words or phrases such as \"expects\", \"anticipates\", \"plans\", \"projects\", \"estimates\", \"envisages\", \"assumes\", \"intends\", \"strategy\", \"goals\", \"objectives\" or variations thereof or stating that certain actions, events or results \"may\", \"could\", \"would\", \"might\" or \"will\" be taken, occur or be achieved, or the negative of any of these terms and similar expressions) are not statements of historical fact and may be forward-looking statements.\nAll forward-looking statements are based on IAMGOLD's or its consultants' current beliefs as well as various assumptions made by them and information currently available to them. The most significant assumptions are set forth above, but generally these assumptions include:\n(i) the presence of and continuity of metals at the Boto Project at estimated grades;\n(ii) the geotechnical and metallurgical characteristics of rock conforming to sampled results; including the quantities of water and the quality of the water that must be diverted or treated during mining operations;\n(iii) the capacities and durability of various machinery and equipment;\n(iv) the availability of personnel, machinery and equipment at estimated prices and within the estimated delivery times;\n(v) currency exchange rates;\n(vi) metals sales prices and exchange rate assumed;\n(vii) appropriate discount rates applied to the cash flows in the economic analysis;\n(viii) tax rates and royalty rates applicable to the proposed mining operation;\n(ix) the availability of acceptable financing under assumed structure and costs;\n* anticipated mining losses and dilution;\n(xi) metallurgical performance;\n(xii) reasonable contingency requirements;\n(xiii) success in realizing proposed operations;\n(xiv) receipt of permits and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms; and\n(xv) the fulfillment of environmental assessment commitments and arrangements with local communities.\nAlthough management considers these assumptions to be reasonable based on information currently available to it, they may prove to be incorrect. Many forward-looking statements are made assuming the correctness of other forward looking statements, such as statements of net present value and internal rates of return, which are based on most of the other forward-looking statements and assumptions herein. The cost information is also prepared using current values, but the time for incurring the costs will be in the future and it is assumed costs will remain stable over the relevant period.\nBy their very nature, forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and specific, and risks exist that estimates, forecasts, projections and other forward-looking statements will not be achieved or that assumptions do not reflect future experience. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements as a number of important factors could cause the actual outcomes to differ materially from the beliefs, plans, objectives, expectations, anticipations, estimates assumptions and intentions expressed in such forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be generally stated as the risk that the assumptions and estimates expressed above do not occur as forecast, but specifically include, without limitation: risks relating to variations in the mineral content within the material identified as Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves from that predicted; variations in rates of recovery and extraction; the geotechnical characteristics of the rock mined or through which infrastructure is built differing from that predicted, the quantity of water that will need to be diverted or treated during mining operations being different from what is expected to be encountered during mining operations or post closure, or the rate of flow of the water being different; developments in world metals markets; risks relating to fluctuations in the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar; increases in the estimated capital and operating costs or unanticipated costs; difficulties attracting the necessary work force; increases in financing costs or adverse changes to the terms of available financing, if any; tax rates or royalties being greater than assumed; changes in development or mining plans due to changes in logistical, technical or other factors; changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined; risks relating to receipt of regulatory approvals; delays in stakeholder negotiations; changes in regulations applying to the development, operation, and closure of mining operations from what currently exists; the effects of competition in the markets in which IAMGOLD operates; operational and infrastructure risks and the additional risks described in IAMGOLD's Annual Information Form filed with SEDAR in Canada (available at www.sedar.com ) for the year ended December 31, 2017 and in the Corporation's Annual Report Form 40-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on EDGAR (available at https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html. IAMGOLD cautions that the foregoing list of factors that may affect future results is not exhaustive.\nWhen relying on our forward-looking statements to make decisions with respect to IAMGOLD, investors and others should carefully consider the foregoing factors and other uncertainties and potential events. IAMGOLD does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time by IAMGOLD or on our behalf, except as required by law.\nAbout IAMGOLD\nIAMGOLD (www.iamgold.com) is a mid-tier mining company with four operating gold mines on three continents.

Jewellery demand saw its first annual rise since 2013 despite a 13 percent increase in gold prices.\nIndian jewellery demand, which saw particular weakness in 2016, rose 12 percent, posting its strongest fourth quarter since the WGC started compiling data in 2000. In China, jewellery demand rose 3 percent last year, its first annual increase since 2013.\nTotal Chinese buying stood at 953.3 tonnes last year, while Indian demand reached 726.9 tonnes, the WGC said. It expects to see buying at similar levels this year, with Indian demand seen at 700-800 tonnes, and Chinese offtake at 900-1,000 tonnes.\nCentral banks also trimmed their overall purchases for a fourth straight year. A drop in demand in the fourth quarter was due entirely to Venezuela's $1.7 billion swap deal with Deutsche Bank elapsing in October, the WGC said.\nThis represents 45 tonnes of gold, it said, and was accounted for in the fourth-quarter figures as a sale.\nDemand from Russia and Kazakhstan stayed buoyant, while the market also saw a rise in demand from Turkey. China, a strong official sector buyer in recent years, was absent from the market in 2017.",

That helped to lift the composite to 54.9, versus 54.8 in the preliminary number and 53.8 in the final May reading. So while growth in the manufacturing sector seems to have reached its limit and is slowing down, the services sector remains strong, which means the overall economy regained some traction at the end of a largely disappointing second quarter. Still, trade worries and political uncertainty coupled with capacity constraints continue to weigh on confidence and Markit reported that the trend in business optimism dipped to a 19 month low in June. So far though job creation continues at a solid pace, with employment rising across all of the countries covered.\nPrice pressures increased and rising input costs also fed through to higher selling prices, which suggests demand remains sufficiently strong for companies to pass on higher costs. Markit suggests survey data point to GDP rising by just over 0.5%, so despite the negative headline rates, GDP growth recovered again in Q2. At the same time cost pressures are likely to feed through to consumer prices in coming months and while the report backs the ECB\u2019s decision to end QE, the pledge to keep rates on hold well into the second half of next year may have been premature.\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire",

For example, as much as I'm rooting for Tesla to succeed in reimagining the transportation landscape, the stock has remained on my radar for years -- never the subject of a buy order -- and I realize it may linger on said watchlist indefinitely.\nBeyond that, there are numerous stocks, like IAMGOLD (NYSE: IAG) and FuelCell Energy (NASDAQ: FCEL), which I'm certain will not only remain absent from my portfolio but from my watchlist as well. Here's why:\nImage source: Getty Images.\nNothing more than fool's gold\nI don't intend to add gold exposure to my portfolio anytime soon. But if the urge to rush into a gold stock surfaced, I'm sure that IAMGOLD would not receive the nod. With, arguably, one of the strongest balance sheets among its gold-mining peers, IAMGOLD certainly deserves respect. But that's hardly a reason for it to earn a place among my holdings. Actually, I'm not too enthusiastic about gold miners in general, since they often underperform the overall market.\nIn IAMGOLD's case, it hasn't only underperformed the S&P 500 over the past 10 years, it has also failed to keep pace with the price of gold.\nOne of the most troubling aspects of IAMGOLD is the high cost which the company requires to dig the yellow stuff out of the ground. In fiscal 2016 and 2017, the company reported all-in sustaining costs (AISC) per gold ounce of $1,057 and $1,003, respectively. In regards to its portfolio, the company operates four mines on three continents, representing a fair degree of risk since complications at one of mines could wreak havoc with the company's financials. This, moreover, impedes the company's ability to achieve economies of scale thus improving its gold margin. It would take many years for the company to develop a large and well-diversified portfolio -- time which I'm not willing to wait.\nAlso of concern is the fact that the company is a pure-play in gold. Since the company primarily generates revenue from the production of one metal- and doesn't seem motivated to diversify its revenue stream in the future -- a sharp downturn in the gold market could be disastrous.\nAvoiding this power play\nOne of only a few fuel cell technology options for investors, FuelCell Energy focuses on the development of stationary power fuel cell projects for customers ranging from utilities to universities. The company, however, has faced a persistent uphill battle in convincing customers that its solutions represent a viable option to conventional power sources despite support from the government, which came in the form of the investment tax credit. Since 2013, when it reported revenue of $188 million, sales have steadily declined in each year, resulting in a top line of $96 million in 2017. The company's competitors, on the other hand, have achieved great success in growing sales over the same period of time. Over the past five years, Plug Power (NASDAQ: PLUG) and Ballard Power Systems (NASDAQ: BLDP) have grown revenue at compound annual growth rates of 32% and 22%, respectively.",

Fed fund futures put the odds of the next rate hike coming in June at around 97%, according to Investing.com\u2019s Fed Rate Monitor Tool. The probability of another increase in December was seen at about 88%.\nHigher interest rates tend to weigh on demand for gold, which doesn\u2019t bear interest, in favor of yield-bearing investments.\nChicago Fed president Charles Evans was scheduled to speak on the economic outlook and monetary policy at 9:40AM ET (13:40GMT) Friday, while San Francisco Fed chief John Williams will make an appearance at 11:15AM ET (15:15GMT).\nIn other metals trading, silver futures lost 12.4 cents, or 0.7%, at $17.115 a troy ounce by 4:08AM ET (8:08GMT).\nPalladium futures traded down 1.6% to $1,009.60 an ounce. Sister metal platinum slid 0.6% at $934.800.\nIn base metals, copper traded up 0.2% to $3.138 a pound.\nRelated Articles\nOil dips but remains close to late-2014 highs on supply cuts, strong demand\nOil stocks face crucial earnings test as investors venture back in",

The market is in no position to change the trend to up, but it is in the window of time for a potentially bullish closing price reversal bottom, commonly known as a lower-low, higher-close.\nA trade though $1242.40 will signal a resumption of the downtrend. This could lead to a test of the July 14 bottom at $1225.10, followed by the July 10 bottom at $1214.50.\nDaily Technical Forecast\nBased on the current price at $1245.50 and yesterday\u2019s price action, the direction of the gold market today will be determined by trader reaction to the long-term uptrending Gann angle at $1242.00.\nHolding above $1242.00 will indicate the presence of buyers. If this generates enough upside momentum, we could see a rally into the nearest resistance angle at $1259.40.\nTaking out $1242.00 with conviction could trigger an acceleration to the downside with targets at $1225.10 and $1214.50.\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire",

Global stocks enter last day of trade near record highs\nThough trading remains thin at the end of the holiday season, global equities were on track to end a very profitable year near record highs.\nEven as the Dow ended Thursday at record highs, all three major U.S. indices were set for monthly gains and U.S. futures pointed to another move higher with no economic data on the calendar to threaten the bullish trend at the end of the year.\nIn the last day of trading for U.S. stocks, the Dow was on track for annual gains of more than 25%, the S&P 500 was up 20%, while the Nasdaq Composite led the pack with a rally of around 29%.\nAt 6:05AM ET (11:05GMT) Friday, the blue-chip Dow futures rose 61 points, or 0.25%, S&P 500 futures advanced 9 points, or 0.32%, while the Nasdaq 100 futures gained 12 points, or 0.19%.\nElsewhere, European shares were set to record their strongest year of gains since 2013 thanks to a surge among tech stocks and a robust resources sector. The broad-based pan-European Stoxx 600 has rallied about 8%. Over in the UK, although the FTSE 100 hit a fresh all-time high on Friday, the London benchmark was the laggard among European bourses with gains of about 6.9%.\nEarlier, Asian shares ended Friday with mixed signs, but the MSCI AC Asia Pacific was just below a decade-long high after rallying 29% in 2017. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 pocketed gains of 20% this year.\n2. Bitcoin set to end volatile December with stellar annual gains\nBitcoin was trading higher on Friday after yet another heavy selloff a day earlier on the back of an announcement from the South Korean government announced that it would take several steps to combat speculation in digital currency trading.\nSouth Korea is a key country for trading in the largest cryptocurrency by market cap as it is calculated that 20% of all Bitcoin transactions take place there and that its citizens own around 1 million bitcoins.\nDespite constant warnings that Bitcoin was a \u201cbubble\u201d, \u201cfraud\u201d, \u201cPonzi scheme\u201d or the like, the popular alternative currency was on track for a stunning rally more than 1,300% in 2017, leaving investors to face the question of whether the \"value-less\" asset could repeat the performance in 2018.\nHowever, the cryptocurrency is well known for its volatility with huge intraday moves on almost a daily basis. Point in case has been the last two weeks after hitting its all-time high on December 17 only to proceed into a bear market with a plunge of around 46%, followed by a recovery of about half those losses. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is down 28.9% from its all-time highs reached less than two weeks ago.\nOn the Bitfinex exchange, Bitcoin was last trading up $660.00 or 4.95%, to $14,004.00 by 6:06AM ET (11:06GMT).\n3. Oil tracks yearly gains above 10% as focus shifts to OPEC-shale battle\nThe U.S. benchmark was last on track for annual gains of nearly 12% while the London barrel was up nearly 17% for the year.\nU.S. oil production surprisingly dropped to 9.754 million barrels per day (bpd), down from 9.789 million bpd the previous week, according to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) released late on Thursday.\nU.S. crude output has risen by around 16% since mid-2016, but analysts had forecast it to surpass 10 million bpd by the end of 2017.\nEarlier on Thursday, oil stockpiles stateside fell by a more-than-expected 4.6 million barrels, helping to support bullish sentiment in black gold.\nU.S. shale production will be a focus looking ahead to 2018 as market participants evaluate whether increased production in the U.S. will derail OPEC attempts to curb output and rebalance global markets.\nInvestors will get their latest glimpse of U.S. output when Baker releases its most recent weekly rig count data.\n4. Dollar hovers near 3-month low\nOn a day without any major U.S. economic reports, the dollar hovered near a 3-month low which some observers suggested was primarily due to market participants taking money off the table after U.S. President Donald Trump officially signed the tax overhaul into law.\nAt 6:06AM ET (11:06GMT), the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback\u2019s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, lost 0.32% at 92.04. That was its lowest level since the end of September in its fourth consecutive session of losses.\nIn 2017, the dollar index has only dropped 0.9%, but the larger losses referred to in many financial media outlets refer to the current one-year plunge of close to 11%.\n5. Gold prices head for best annual rally since 2010\nThe aforementioned dollar weakness propelled gold to its best annual performance since 2010. A weaker greenback makes the precious metal more affordable for holders of foreign currency.\nWhile looking ahead to 2018, the precious metal has also benefitted this year from investors piling into the safe-haven asset in the face of continuous geopolitical tension. North Korea has been at the forefront of those worries as the U.S., China, North Korea and Japan all work to curb Pyonyang\u2019s nuclear program.\nOn Friday, Comex gold futures rose 0.19% to an intraday high of $1,299.60 a troy ounce by 6:07AM ET (11:07GMT).\nThat was a fourth straight session of gains, while on track for a weekly rise of around 1.6%.",

The United Sates is also mulling to impose tariff or import duties on Chinese solar panels and washing machines manufactured in China and its neighbors.

In fact, as of 1Q18, 57% of the annual rental revenues in effect were derived from investment-grade or large cap tenants.\nAlso, the acquisition of 219 East 42nd Street is anticipated to generate immediate significant net operating income (NOI) and strong yield from an investment grade tenant. Notably, the company\u2019s New York City portfolio is fully leased, with 70% of annual rental revenues from the region coming from investment grade tenant.\nAlexandria has a decent balance sheet and ample liquidity. Importantly, the company has improved its credit profile over the last two years by opting to forward sale equity agreements and senior notes issuance. This has also helped the company fund its capital needs for the current year. Hence, it enjoys a solid financial position.\nThis June, Alexandria raised its second-quarter 2018 cash dividend to 93 cents per share, marking a sequential increase of 3%. Prior to this, the company had announced a 5% sequential hike in its fourth-quarter 2017 dividends. Given the company\u2019s financial position and lower payout ratio compared to that of the industry, this dividend rate is likely to be sustainable.\nIn addition, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 3%, as against the industry\u2018s decline of 0.8% over the past year. Moreover, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 funds from operations (FFO) per share being revised marginally upward in a month\u2019s time.\nNonetheless, exposure to Canada and Asia through its subsidiaries exposes Alexandria to risks from currency fluctuations. Further, the company follows the strategy of recycling capital from real estate sales, including non-core operating assets, to finance pre-leased value-creation development and redevelopment projects. However, the near-term dilution effect of such moves on earnings is unavoidable.",

Assay results are pending.\nHole 36 has intersected an intensely mineralized diorite intrusion and is expected to extend the Mineral Resource down dip and to the northeast.\nHole 41, drilled from the northeast side of the deposit and collared near the Parambas anomaly, has intersected very shallow epithermal (low temperature) mineralized vein sets between 60m and 100m depth. Additional porphyry style mineralization is interpreted at depth, on the northeast flank of the Alpala Deposit.\nNine other holes (29-D4, 32-D3, 34-D1, 37, 38-D1, 39, 40, 41, 42 and 43) have yet to reach target depth.\nSignificant Mineral Resource extensions at Alpala are being targeted along the open margins of the deposit and at depth (Figure 1).\nAgui\u00f1aga\nThe Agui\u00f1aga target is anticipated to be drilled using a man portable rig during the second quarter of 2018. A series of three holes will test key elements of geochemical and geophysical anomalies:\n- North-easterly- and north-westerly-oriented zones of strong molybdenum anomalism\n- Coincident high Cu/Zn, Mo, Cu, and Au in soil geochemical highs.\n- A deep root in the magnetic model.\n- Coincident high chargeability and magnetic features, interpreted to be a magnetic, chalcopyrite-rich potassic core to a porphyry system.\n- Vertically extensive cylindrical features in the chargeability and resistivity surveys.\nCost Control at Cascabel\nCost control at Cascabel is proceeding according to plan. The 20,000m drilled since the November capital raising has been completed at a cost of US$530/m. This is the result of scale efficiencies, use of directional drilling technology (Devico) and increased rig supervision. To date, the use of \u2018daughter holes\u2019 off a single \u2018parent\u2019 hole has saved over 12,000m of drilling.\nRig to Resource Data Protocol\nSolGold is implementing a Rig to Resource data transfer protocol which provides for immediate electronic recording of all drilling, surveying, logging and geochemical data as well as geophysical and geological models and interpretations into files accessible by SolGold explorationists and SolGold\u2019s independent consultants. This is being designed to enable resource statement upgrades rapidly and the provision of interpretable data in real time.\nAbout Cascabel:\nExploraciones Novomining S.A. (\u201cENSA\u201d), an Ecuadorean company owned by SolGold Plc and Cornerstone, holds 100% of the Cascabel concession. Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including SolGold\u2019s fully funding the project through to feasibility, SolGold Plc will own 85% of the equity of ENSA and Cornerstone will own the remaining 15% of ENSA. SolGold Plc is funding 100% of the exploration at Cascabel and is the operator of the project.\nCascabel is in northwestern Ecuador in an under-explored northern section of the Andean Copper Belt, 60 km northeast of the undeveloped inferred resource of 982 million tons at 0.89% Cu Llurimaga (formerly Junin) copper project (0.4% Cu cut-off grade; Micon International Co. Ltd. Technical Report for Ascendant Exploration SA, August 20, 2004, pages 28 & 29). Mineralization identified at the Llurimaga copper project is not necessarily indicative of the mineralization on the Cascabel Property.\nQualified Person:\nYvan Crepeau, MBA, P.Geo., Cornerstone\u2019s Vice President, Exploration and a qualified person in accordance with National Instrument 43-101, is responsible for supervising the exploration program at the Cascabel project for Cornerstone and has reviewed and approved the information contained in this news release.\nLogging, sampling, assaying and reporting\nHoles referred to in this release were or are being drilled using HTW, NTW, NQ and BQ core sizes (respectively 7.1, 5.6, 4.8 and 3.7 cm diameter). Geotechnical measurements such as core recovery, fracturing, rock quality designations (RQD\u2019s), specific gravity and photographic logging are performed systematically prior to assaying. The core is logged, magnetic susceptibility measured and key alteration minerals identified by experienced loggers and sometimes using an on-site portable spectrometer. Core is then sawed in half at the ENSA core logging facility, and half of the core is delivered by ENSA employees for preparation at ALS Minerals Laboratories (ALS) sample preparation facility in Quito. Core samples are prepared crushing to 70% passing 2 mm (10 mesh), splitting 250 g and pulverizing to 85% passing 75 microns (200 mesh) (ALS code CRU-31, SPL21 and PUL-32). Prepared samples are then shipped to ALS in Lima, Peru where samples are assayed for a multi-element suite (ALS code ME-MSP61, 1g split, 4-acid digestion, ICP-MS finish). Over limit results for Ag (> 100 g/t) and Cu, (> 1%) are systematically re-assayed (ALS code Ag-AA62, 4-acid digestion, AAS finish). Gold is assayed using a 30 g split, Fire Assay (FA) and AA finish (ALS code Au-AA23).\nQuality assurance / Quality control (QA/QC)\nThe ALS Laboratory is a qualified assayer that performs and makes available internal assaying controls. Duplicates, certified blanks and standards are systematically used (1 control sample every 15-20 samples). Rejects, a 100 g pulp for each core sample and the remaining half-core are stored for future use and controls.\nAbout Cornerstone:\nCornerstone Capital Resources Inc. is a mineral exploration company with a diversified portfolio of projects in Ecuador and Chile, and a proven ability to identify, acquire and advance properties of merit.\nFurther information is available on Cornerstone\u2019s website: www.cornerstoneresources.com and on Twitter.

The dollar was down about 1 percent against the yen <JPY=>.\n\"It's quite significant given that this is the first time in a very long time that a Treasury secretary has spoken against a strong dollar,\" said Sireen Harajli, FX strategist at Mizuho.\nGold prices rose, hitting their highest level since August 2016, as investors sought insurance against fears of rising inflation. Spot gold <XAU=> was up 1.4 percent $1,360.23 an ounce.\nIn U.S. stocks, the S&P 500 ended down slightly as Ross' comments fueled worries of a trade war.

This led to a weakening in the dollar and caused a spurt higher in the gold prices.\nGold Traders In Wait and Watch Mode\nThe gold prices pushed through the 1320 region and went ahead into the 1325 region but this move has been quickly reversed over the next few hours and we now see the prices back below the 1320 region as of this writing. The situation still remains fluid with the traders not being able to decide on whether they need to be short or long. The price action over the last couple of weeks would suggest that the traders should be going long on every correction with the expectation that the bull run would continue. But the fact that there has not been much fundamentals that support such a move should keep the bulls wary. The dollar has also been holding steady since the beginning of the week which has also helped to keep the gold prices in a leash.\nThe oil prices continue to move higher with the prices above the $63 region as the inventory data from the US has shown a larger draw than what was expected. This confirms the direction and the fact that the uptrend is still intact which should now spur the prices towards $65 and beyond.\nSilver prices continue to chop around the $17 region and as we have been saying over the last few forecasts, they seem to be following the gold price action and hence the traders should be looking in that direction for trading silver.\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire",

And the interest-rate outlook firmed as the economy rebounded from an emerging market drag.\n\"And somewhat similar to today, the secular boom in dot-com stocks, which in turn drove the cross-border capital flows supporting the dollar in the late 1990s, was not White House-dependent,\" he said.",

Goldcorp expects gold production and operating costs to improve substantially in the fourth quarter of 2018 to approximately 620,000 ounces of gold at AISC of approximately $750 per ounce as substantially all of Pe\u00f1asquito's production will come from higher grade ore from the main Pe\u00f1asco pit, and \u00c9l\u00e9onore and Cerro Negro continue their ramp ups to optimum production rates.\n- Significant project milestones reached in support of the Company's 20/20/20 growth plan and Beyond 20/20 program. Commissioning of the Pe\u00f1asquito Pyrite Leach Project commenced, with first gold and commercial production expected in the fourth quarter of 2018. The Century Gold Project submitted its Associated Project Description to regulatory authorities in July 2018 and the Yukon Environmental and Socio-Economic Board deemed the Coffee Project adequate in August 2018 .\n- An additional $30 million of sustainable annual efficiencies identified, bringing the Company closer to reaching its goal of achieving $350 million of sustainable annual efficiencies by the end of 2019. Building on the momentum from achieving $250 million of the efficiencies by mid-2018 and identifying the additional $30 million of efficiencies during the third quarter of 2018, work is underway across Goldcorp's operations to identify the remaining opportunities that are expected to drive the Company towards realizing its 20/20/20 plan.\n- Proven and Probable Gold Mineral Reserves are 52.8 Million Ounces. Goldcorp mineral reserves increased at Musselwhite with the higher-grade extension of PQ Deeps and the addition of the WEL zone and at Cerro Negro, with an inaugural mineral reserve estimate at the Silica Cap. Overall mineral reserves additions at Goldcorp-operated sites essentially replaced depletion over the 12-month period.\n\"Steady project execution in the third quarter during a transition period at our flagship Pe\u00f1asquito mine continued a process of de-risking our 20/20/20 production growth and cost reduction plans. The commissioning of the PLP at Pe\u00f1asquito, ongoing development of the Materials Handling system at Musselwhite and the near completion of the ramp up at both Cerro Negro and \u00c9l\u00e9onore are expected to lead to significantly improved gold production and costs in the fourth quarter of 2018\", said David Garofalo , President and Chief Executive Officer of Goldcorp. \"At the same time, with our renewed focus on exploration, we essentially replaced gold reserve depletion across our operating assets, establishing a strong foundation to achieve our gold reserve target of 60 million ounces by 2021.\"\nGoldcorp is also announcing the appointment of Cristina Bitar to the Company's Board of Directors, effective as of October 24, 2018.\n\"We are excited about adding Cristina to our Board of Directors,\" said Ian Telfer , Chairman of the Board of Goldcorp. \"Her experience and knowledge will benefit the company and shareholders by enhancing the effectiveness of our board with communication, stakeholder management, strategy, innovation and diversity of thinking.\"\nMrs. Bitar is a senior partner at Azerta, one of the leading strategic communication and public affair agency in Chile and Peru where she executes on complex business crisis, regulatory matters and highly visible media and social issues for corporate clients.

Attributable performance measures include the Company's mining operations and projects and the Company's share from Pueblo Viejo, Alumbrera and NuevaUni\u00f3n\n- Adjusted operating cash flows are comprised of Goldcorp's share of operating cash flows before working capital changes, calculated on an attributable basis to include the Company's share of Pueblo Viejo, Alumbrera and NuevaUni\u00f3n's operating cash flows before working capital changes. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company and certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance and ability to operate without reliance on additional external funding or use of available cash.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated financial statements to Goldcorp's share of adjusted operating cash flows:\nThree months ended September 30 | ||||\n($ millions) | 2018 | 2017 | ||\nNet cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations | $193 | $315 | ||\nChange in working capital | (63) | (57) | ||\nAdjusted operating cash flows provided by Pueblo Viejo and Alumbrera | 41 | 50 | ||\nGoldcorp's share of adjusted operating cash flows | $171 | $308 |\n3. | \"Cash costs: by product\" per ounce and \"AISC\" per ounce are non-GAAP financial performance measures. |\nCash costs: by-product:\nTotal cash costs: by-product incorporate Goldcorp's share of all production costs, including adjustments to inventory carrying values, adjusted for changes in estimates in reclamation and closure costs at the Company's closed mines which are non-cash in nature, and include Goldcorp's share of by-product silver, lead, zinc and copper credits, and treatment and refining charges included within revenue. Additionally, cash costs are adjusted for realized gains and losses arising on the Company's commodity and foreign currency contracts which the Company enters into to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in by-product metal prices, heating oil prices and foreign exchange rates, which may impact the Company's operating costs.\nIn addition to conventional measures, the Company assesses this per ounce measure in a manner that isolates the impacts of gold production volumes, the by-product credits, and operating costs fluctuations such that the non-controllable and controllable variability is independently addressed. The Company uses total cash costs: by product per gold ounce to monitor its operating performance internally, including operating cash costs, as well as in its assessment of potential development projects and acquisition targets. The Company believes this measure provides investors and analysts with useful information about the Company's underlying cash costs of operations and the impact of by-product credits on the Company's cost structure and is a relevant metric used to understand the Company's operating profitability and ability to generate cash flow. When deriving the production costs associated with an ounce of gold, the Company includes by-product credits as the Company considers that the cost to produce the gold is reduced as a result of the by-product sales incidental to the gold production process, thereby allowing the Company's management and other stakeholders to assess the net costs of gold production.\nThe Company reports total cash costs: by-product on a gold ounces sold basis. In the gold mining industry, this is a common performance measure but does not have any standardized meaning. The Company follows the recommendations of the Gold Institute Production Cost Standard. The Gold Institute, which ceased operations in 2002, was a non-regulatory body and represented a global group of producers of gold and gold products. The production cost standard developed by the Gold Institute remains the generally accepted standard of reporting cash costs of production by gold mining companies.\nAISC:\nAISC include total production cash costs incurred at the Company's mining operations, which forms the basis of the Company's by-product cash costs. Additionally, the Company includes sustaining capital expenditures, corporate administrative expense, mine-site exploration and evaluation costs, and reclamation cost accretion and amortization. The measure seeks to reflect the full cost of gold production from current operations, therefore expansionary capital and non-sustaining expenditures are excluded. Certain other cash expenditures, including tax payments, dividends and financing costs are also excluded.\nThe Company believes that this measure represents the total costs of producing gold from current operations, and provides the Company and other stakeholders of the Company with additional information of the Company's operational performance and ability to generate cash flows. AISC, as a key performance measure, allows the Company to assess its ability to support capital expenditures and to sustain future production from the generation of operating cash flows. This information provides management with the ability to more actively manage capital programs and to make more prudent capital investment decisions.\nThe Company reports AISC on a gold ounces sold basis. This performance measure was adopted as a result of an initiative undertaken within the gold mining industry; however, this performance measure has no standardized meaning and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company follows the guidance note released by the World Gold Council, which became effective January 1, 2014 . The World Gold Council is a non-regulatory market development organization for the gold industry whose members comprise global senior gold mining companies.\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of total cash costs: by product to reported production costs:\nThree months ended September 30, 2018\n($ millions unless stated otherwise)\nProduction | By-Product | Treatment and | Other | Total Cash | Ounces (000's) | Total Cash Costs: | ||||||||\nTotal before associates and joint | $ | 424 | $ | (161) | $ | 17 | $ | 2 | $ | 282 | 395 | $ | 713 | |\nAssociates and joint venture | $ | 70 | $ | (21) | $ | 1 | $ | 16 | $ | 66 | 113 | $ | 576 | |\nTotal - Attributable | $ | 494 | $ | (182) | $ | 18 | $ | 18 | $ | 348 | 508 | $ | 683 |\n|Three months ended September 30, 2017\n($ millions unless stated otherwise)\nProduction | By-Product | Treatment and | Other | Total Cash | Ounces (000's) | Total Cash Costs: | ||||||||\nTotal before associates and joint | $ | 459 | $ | (268) | $ | 32 | $ | (3) | $ | 220 | 490 | $ | 451 | |\nAssociates and joint venture | $ | 106 | $ | (22) | $ | 2 | $ | (15) | $ | 71 | 116 | $ | 617 | |\nTotal - Attributable | $ | 565 | $ | (290) | $ | 34 | $ | (18) | $ | 291 | 606 | $ | 483 |\n(a) | Production costs includes $12 million in royalties for the three months ended September 30, 2018 (three months ended September 30, 2017\u2013 $19 million). |\n(b) | Total cash costs: by-product per ounce may not calculate based on amounts presented in these tables due to rounding. |\n(c) | If silver, copper, lead and zinc were treated as co-products, total cash costs for the three months ended September 30, 2018 would have been $701 per ounce of gold (three months ended September 30, 2017 \u2013 $663 per ounce). |\nAs described above, AISC include total production cash costs incurred at the Company's mining operations, which forms the basis of the Company's cash costs: by-product and which are reconciled to reported production costs in the tables above.

The trend was reaffirmed early Wednesday when buyers took out the previous top at $1349.20. If the upside momentum continues then we could see a test of the September 8 top at $1370.00.\nThe main trend will change to down on a move through $1329.10. Today\u2019s session also begins with gold in the window of time for a possible closing price reversal top.\nThe main range is $1370.00 to $1242.70. Its retracement zone at $1321.40 to $1306.40 is new support.\nDaily Swing Chart Forecast\nYesterday\u2019s high was $1366.80. Gold reached this high because it was underpinned by an extremely weak dollar due to negative comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Some traders believe Mnuchin may have been misquoted.\nMnuchin will get a chance to clarify his comments early Thursday. If he softens his tone toward the dollar then it may strengthen. This should put pressure on gold prices. If he reiterates his call for a weaker dollar then gold should challenge or perhaps breakout out above $1370.00.\nGold traders will also react to the European Central Bank\u2019s monetary policy statement and comments from ECB President Mario Draghi. This news should also influence the direction of the dollar.\nUltimately, the direction of the gold market will be determined by the direction of the dollar. We\u2019re still in a weak dollar/strong gold, strong dollar/weak gold mode.\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire",

The dollar plunged last week to as low as 89.41 but rose again after signs of a global trade war initiated by U.S. president Trump\u2019s tariff plan on imported steel and aluminum receded.\nGold is sensitive to moves higher in the U.S. dollar \u2013 a stronger dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of foreign currency, hence reduces investor demand for the precious metal.\nRelated Articles\nOil edges up on reduced U.S. drilling activity, booming job market\nOil Prices Rise on Less U.S. Drilling\nIran: OPEC could agree in June to start easing oil output cuts in 2019 - WSJ",

(NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). So why not just buy the popular PowerShares QQQ (NASDAQ:QQQ)?\nThis tech-heavy fund is one of the oldest and largest ways to place the sector. The QQQ ETF was founded in 1999 and boasts over $60 billion in assets. This ETF is benchmarked to the Nasdaq 100, instead of a broad play on the entire stock market.\nYes, it is market cap weighted so it\u2019s biased towards the big guys in the sector. AAPL stock is actually almost 12% of the portfolio alone. But if you\u2019ve been watching the rally for the FAANG stocks lately, you\u2019ll agree that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing.\nSource: Shutterstock\nBest ETFs to Buy for 2018: iShares Gold Trust (IAU)\nOn the flip side of a play on the growth in tech is a safe-haven investment in gold. Thanks to the prospect of inflation, thanks to a roaring economy and thanks to some technical improvements in the commodity markets, gold is looking great right now.\nIf you don\u2019t want to go through the hassle of buying and storing physical gold in your home, consider buying bullion via an ETF like the iShares Gold Trust (NYSEARCA:IAU).\nThe movement of this fund correlates to gold prices. While investors may be familiar with the popular SPDR Gold Trust (NYSEARCA:GLD), it\u2019s worth noting that the iShares fund charges just 0.25% a year in expenses vs. 0.40% for GLD. That\u2019s a savings of $15 annually on every $10,000 invested, which can add up over time.\nRemember, a rally in gold is not mutually exclusive to a rally in stocks. After all, the precious metal ran up about 13% last year even as the S&P 500 soared.\nBest ETFs to Buy for 2018: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index (EEM)\nIn 2017, many emerging market funds outpaced even the brisk profits of U.S. stocks. That is likely to continue in the new year. Goldman Sachs recently forecasted double-digit growth for the popular MSCI emerging markets index, driven by a \u201cyounger and friendlier\u201d credit cycle.\nThe massive iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index (ETF) (NYSEARCA:EEM) is the simplest and easiest way to play this trend \u2014 since, after all, it\u2019s benchmarked to the very index Goldman mentioned in its 2018 outlook.\nAs with other funds in this list, investors should note that the fund is very focused on a small group of countries. EEM has a roughly 30% allocation in China. But these regions were the ones with the best performance last year and the most potential going forward, that may not necessarily be a bad thing.\nBest ETFs to Buy for 2018: Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM)\nEvery investor should consider dividend stocks, whether they seek income in retirement or simply an extra bit of performance. And the low cost leaders at Vanguard give you a great way to chase the highest yielding stocks in one fund via the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEARCA:VYM)\nThanks to a ridiculously low 0.08% expense ratio \u2014 just $8 annually on every $10,000 invested \u2013investors get to keep more of the corporate paydays from component stocks that include mega-caps Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) among others.\nThe result is a great 2.9% yield without taking on exposure to overly risky stocks.\nSource: Shutterstock\nBest ETFs to Buy for 2018: Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Energy ETF (RYE)\nFor energy stocks, 2018 could be the year of a long-awaited comeback. After falling big time across 2014 and 2015 along with the collapse of crude oil prices, we\u2019ve at last seen some stability return to the oil and gas space. That includes a rally of almost 30% in the last six months for big oil icon Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), for instance.\nThere are many sector funds to play energy, but I prefer the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Energy ETF (NYSEARCA:RYE) because it balances out the holdings regardless of size.\nMany investors may not know that the Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron alone account for nearly 40% of the Energy Select Sector SPDR (ETF) (NYSESARCA:XLE) thanks to a weighting of the fund by market value. Why not just buy the individual stocks with that much riding on two names?\nInstead, the equal-weight approach of the Guggenheim ETF means you get about 3% allocation towards 32 different holdings and a diversified way to play the sector.\nBest ETFs to Buy for 2018: Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY)\nIf you want a sign that the economy is doing well, look no further than record consumer confidence. And if you want to tap into this trend, look no further than the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (ETF) (NYSEARCA:XLY).\nThings were already looking great from a spending perspective as 2017 wound down, including a 17-year high for consumer confidence. But when you throw more money at American consumers thanks to tax cuts, that means even more spending in 2018. And what better way to benefit than the Consumer Discretionary ETF?\nThis fund holds names that are popular with American shoppers, including Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE). If you think the favorable spending trends will continue, then you\u2019ll want a footprint in these stocks via the XLY fund in 2018.\nSource: Shutterstock\nBest ETFs To Buy For 2018: iShares 0-5 Year High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (SHYG)\nThere is still a lot of skepticism over junk bonds. This is especially true since the asset class is trading for very little risk premium despite a history of volatility and big potential losses for investors.\nDespite the worries of the last few years and a recent rough spot for junk bonds to end 2017, however, there remains a good case to be made for high yield bonds \u2014 particularly shorter duration debt that is less sensitive to changes in interest rates.\nTake the iShares 0-5 Year High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:SHYG) that yields about 5.2% right now. The fund has been choppy, but finished 2017 with capital appreciation of about 5%. This is on top of a generous dividend from the high-yield bonds in its portfolio.\nWith a diversified junk bond fund, you can smooth out some of the bumps in the road. And while I certainly expect there to be individual companies that see some fireworks, a thriving American economy and strong appetite for high-yield debt means that the environment is generally favorable again for junk in 2018.",

The maximum capacity of the production system is designed at ~6,000 tpd. AMC believes that if a steady-state production rate of 4,500 tpd is achieved, not an unreasonable target in their assessment, then C1 costs would be expected to be lowered to around USD$0.63/lb Cu (net of by-products), well in the lower half of the first quartile of the world copper production curve.\nMike Johnston, Nautilus\u2019 CEO commented: \u201cWe are very excited by the results of the PEA. Expected C1 operating costs at US$1.36/lb Cu for the entire project are in the lower half of the cost curve, and include the 15 month ramp up period. Expected \u201csteady-state\u201d C1 operating costs of US$0.80/lb Cu sit comfortably in the lower half of the first quartile of the production curve, and highlight the potentially seriously disruptive nature of seafloor mining to the world's mining industry. These are very competitive capital and operating costs, and have additional room to move.\u201d\nThe production systems on which the PEA is based are currently under construction.\nThe Nautilus business model is based on using the capital, IP, and know how that Nautilus has developed for the Solwara 1 Project, and applying it to future discoveries at minimal additional CAPEX cost, and with a much reduced \u201cramp up curve\u201d for subsequent projects.\nThe oceans have significant potential to provide the key minerals (copper, gold, silver, zinc, nickel, cobalt and manganese) needed by the world as it transitions to a low carbon future based on electric vehicles and batteries. Nautilus\u2019 seafloor production system with its very small environmental footprint, lack of tailings, and industry leading OPEX and CAPEX costs, will allow the Company and its partner, Eda Kopa (Solwara) Limited to lead the world in this exciting new industry.\nAbout AMC and the Technical Report\nThe Company\u2019s subsidiary, Nautilus Minerals Niugini Ltd, engaged AMC to undertake the PEA for the Solwara 1 Project and compile a technical report compliant with NI 43-101. AMC is one of the world\u2019s most trusted mining consulting companies and operates from eight offices in Australia, Canada, Singapore, Russia and the United Kingdom. It helps mining leaders find smarter ways to mine and unearth hidden business value. AMC provides specialist services in geology and mineral resource estimation, mining engineering, mineral processing, geometallurgy, and geotechnical engineering. Its global team of experts prepares mine feasibility studies, conducts studies to optimize and improve operating mines, and provides specialist technical reports for corporate and financial transactions. AMC has a long track record of producing high-quality results that provide confidence to explorers, miners and investors.\nThe Company is today filing the technical report dated February 27, 2018, prepared by AMC entitled \"Nautilus Solwara 1 PEA\". The authors of the technical report, all of whom are \"qualified persons\" under NI 43-101, are Ian Thomas Lipton, Edward Vincent Gleeson, and Peter Munro. The technical report will be available under the Company's profile on the SEDAR website at www.sedar.com as well as on the Company's website at www.nautilusminerals.com.\nAbout Solwara 1\nThe Solwara 1 Project is a deep-sea mining project located in the Bismarck Sea of PNG. Construction of a commercial-scale mining operation to extract deep-sea metallic mineral resources is well advanced. Production has not yet occurred.\nThe PEA is based on the existing mineral resource estimate at the Solwara 1 Project. The Company cautions that the PEA is preliminary in nature, that it includes inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA will be realized. A pre-feasibility study has not been undertaken. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.\nAll dollar amounts in this release are presented in US dollars unless otherwise stated.\nThe results of the PEA represent forward-looking information that are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause results to differ materially from those presented herein. See \"Forward-Looking Statements\" below. Completion of the production system and initiation of mining operations at the Solwara 1 Project are also dependent on the Company raising the remaining capital required, and there can be no assurances that this can be achieved.\nAll scientific and technical information contained in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Ian Lipton, Principal Geologist at AMC, who is a \"qualified person\" under NI 43-101.\n* Notes: The PEA is based on a first production date of Q3 2019. The Company is currently forecasting a Q2 2019 first production date (subject to financing), but this is also subject to finalizing the ship build contract delivery date between Mawei Shipyard and MAC, and finalizing the integration philosophy and methodology (due early Q2 2018). The PEA\u2019s effective date is 1st January 2018. Metal prices used in the PEA's base case were $7,319/t Cu, $1,200/Oz Au, $18.00/Oz Ag. The upside case used copper and gold prices averaged over the forward curve for the proposed production period (out to Q2 2022), on the effective date (1st January 2018), and were estimated by AMC using US$7,981/tonne Cu, and US$1,391/Oz Au prices. All other cost and production parameters are detailed in the PEA.\nC1 cash costs per pound is a financial performance measure based on cost of sales and includes treatment and refinement charges and by-product credits, but excludes the impact of depreciation and royalties. C1 does not have any standardized meaning under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards, and may not be comparable to similar measures of performance presented by other companies.\nFor more information please refer to www.nautilusminerals.com or contact:\n| Investor Relations Nautilus Minerals Inc.

There has been $7 billion in outflows over the past three months, he added.\nGold has weakened this year alongside many emerging-market currencies because the dollar strengthened and US interest rates became more attractive. On August 13, gold fell below the key technical level of $1,200 an ounce for the first time since early 2017. It traded up 0.7% to $1,202.90 an ounce on Friday.\nGold is usually favored as a safe haven during market turmoil, but even all the back and forth on trade between the US and China has not stirred up a bid for the metal.\nBut gold \"will be bid if US dollar follows US Treasury yields lower,\" Hartnett said. \"Watch for DXY [US dollar index] break below 95.\" It was down 0.4% to 95.28 on Friday.\nLower US Treasury yields would imply that bond prices are rising, and that's a bet many investors are not making right now. In fact, hedge funds have placed record bets against 10- and 30-year Treasurys, according to the latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\nThis wager has worked out so far this year for speculators, but not for gold traders. The 10-year yield topped 3% in April for the first time since 2014 and has risen by 44 basis points since the start of the year.\nCFTC data further show that investors have not been this doubtful of a gold rally since 2006. Managed money net-long positions on the CME are at the lowest since that year, while net-long positioning turned negative in mid-August for the first time since 2001.\nBut with record short positioning comes the risk of a short squeeze, which could propel gold prices higher even faster.

Bitcoin rebounded from a brutal selloff last week. The wild-trading digital asset gained 13.79 percent as of Tuesday afternoon, after sinking by more than a quarter from Dec 16 to 25. [nL4N1OQ1PI] Apple put a damper on an equity market that has posted double-digit percentage gains in 2017 on the back of a U.S. tax bill signed into law last week and stronger sales that were expected to extend into the holiday season. Yet, bearish brokerage calls on iPhone X demand pushed the company's shares to their worst single-day percentage fall since Aug. 10. The company will slash its sales forecast for its flagship phone in the current quarter to 30 million units, down from what it said was an initial plan of 50 million units, Taiwan's Economic Daily reported, citing unidentified sources. The news hit shares of Apple suppliers, too, including Broadcom Ltd , Skyworks Solutions Inc , Finisar Corp and Lumentum Holdings Inc . \"There probably are a good number of U.S. investors that have slight to moderate overexposure to domestic stocks - we've had a great performance year,\" said Invesco Ltd Chief Global Market Strategist Kristina Hooper. \"It could be an opportunity to do some profit-taking, a little bit of trimming, and moving to areas that have lower valuations.\" The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> fell 7.85 points, or 0.03 percent, to 24,746.21, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 2.84 points, or 0.11 percent, to 2,680.5 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 23.71 points, or 0.34 percent, to 6,936.25. MSCI's measure of stocks across the globe <.MIWD00000PUS> shed 0.05 percent. Volatility, notably lacking in U.S. markets in 2017, gained during the light trading day. The CBOE Volatility Index <.VIX>, an options-based gauge, rose 0.35 points, to 10.25. TWO-YEAR YIELDS RISE Two-year U.S. Treasury yields rose to nine-year highs, exacerbating a collapse of the gap in yields between short and long-term bonds. The gap between 2-year and 10-year yields shrank to 56.7 basis points as the United States sold $26 billion in the shorter-duration notes. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 5/32 in price to yield 2.472 percent, from 2.488 percent late on Friday. The 2-year note last fell 1/32 in price to yield 1.9033 percent, from 1.895 percent the previous trading day. Currencies changed little during the day. The dollar index <.DXY>, tracking the U.S. unit against a basket of major currencies, fell 0.09 percent, with the euro also down 0.05 percent to $1.1862. Sterling was last trading at $1.3375, up 0.05 percent versus the greenback, while the Japanese yen strengthened 0.07 percent on the day. Japan's households spent more than expected in November while consumer inflation ticked up and the jobless rate hit a fresh 24-year low, according to data earlier on Tuesday, offering the nation's central bank some hope an economic recovery will drive up inflation to its 2 percent target.

It also tends to make gold more appealing as a safe-haven asset during times of economic or geopolitical uncertainty.\nBut as Wall Street and European stocks pulled back from declines of more than 1 percent and the dollar pared losses, gold shed some of its gains.\n\u201cGold worked for the hedgers today, as expected. When stocks were off over 500 points, gold was up over $1,350. As stocks pared losses, (gold) gave back gains,\" said George Gero, managing director of RBC Wealth Management.\nAlso capping gold's upside were signs of still-steady global economic growth.\n\"Political (trade war) factors are offsetting the negative factors (for gold) of a generally improving U.S. and global economy. We think gold is heading upwards largely because we have a weaker dollar view, but we think the range is going to hold for a while,\" said Matthew Turner, commodities strategist at Macquarie.\nInvestors are looking ahead to U.S. nonfarm payrolls on Friday, with stronger-than-expected data a risk for gold as it will likely support the dollar and calm fears over growth, even in the face of a potential trade war, analysts said.\nMeanwhile, spot silver fell 0.6 percent to $16.27 per ounce, after dipping to a six-day low of $16.23.\nPlatinum dropped 0.9 percent to $915.50 an ounce, earlier falling to $908, its lowest level since December.\nPalladium lost 0.7 percent to $922.70 an ounce after touching $913, its lowest price since October.\n(Additional reporting by Swati Verma in Bengaluru; Editing by David Evans and Matthew Lewis)",

        "full_text": "Low Volume Marks Seasonal Trading; Stocks Struggle Early On\nThe Ticker Tape\nDirection appeared to be an issue in the early going as stocks struggled to gain footing in the seasonally tight trading session.\nThe three major benchmarks floated in and out of positive territory ahead of the market\u2019s open following Tuesday\u2019s weak showing. If the session ends in negative terrain, it would mark the first three-day fallback since late September. Volume is typically low in the week between Christmas and New Year\u2019s, and could cause volatility. But remember this: Low volume or not, the markets have scored 62 all-time highs this year\u2014well surpassing the average of 29 since World War 11.\nThe lowest-performing S&P sectors this year have been energy and telecom. Movement out of momentum trading and into value trading could point to some rebalancing in those two sectors, according to some market analysts.\nReports that might be interesting to watch today include consumer confidence and pending home sales. Home prices apparently are ramping up, according to a recent report. (See below.) Some economists have projected that sales of homes signed, but not closed, will be higher with today\u2019s report.\nBoeing (BA) shares climbed 1% in early trading. The plane maker said it has four Dreamliners on order from Morocco\u2019s Royal Air Morac. The price tag: $1.1 billion per plane.\nRetail stocks were on fire yesterday. MasterCard Advisors\u2019 (MA) SpendingPulse report showed that holiday sales were 4.9% higher than they were a year ago. E-commerce sales surged by 18%, the report said, to help set a record in dollars spent. Thirteen retail stocks, including Kohl\u2019s Corporation (NYSE: KSS), Gap Inc. (NYSE: GPS), Best Buy Co Inc (NYSE: BBY), Lululemon Athletica Inc. (NASDAQ: LULU) and American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE: AEO), hit fresh 52-week peaks.\nThat apparently wasn\u2019t enough, however, to push the benchmarks into positive territory. Low volume might have been the culprit. But some market analysts blamed the slightly downward trading throughout the day on Apple\u2019s (AAPL) 2.5% pullback. That cut about 30 points from the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrials ($DJI) and probably helped drag down some other technology stocks and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (COMP). Both ended off 0.3% while the S&P 500 (SPX) slipped 0.11%.\nSupply disruptions in the Middle East and Europe might have helped push crude oil prices over the $60-mark in intraday trading to tap a 52-week high Tuesday. That\u2019s an important resistance level that some analysts have been closely watching. Per-barrel prices for West Texas Intermediate (/CL), the U.S. benchmark, closed at $59.80. (See chart.) Oil prices declined slightly in the early going. Gold prices edged up a tad after finishing Tuesday\u2019s session at a four-week high of $1,287.80.\nTreasury yields were off a bit early on. The 10-year yield was at 2.47% while the two-year yield stood at 1.91%. As noted many times here, a flattening curve, which some market analysts say has historically pointed to economic weakness, could continue to bear watching in the new year.\nFIGURE 1: CRUDE TAPS 52-WEEK HIGH. Supply disruptions in the Middle East and Europe could have helped push crude oil prices to a fresh peak Tuesday. West Texas Intermediate (/CL) crude oil prices tipped over the $60-mark per barrel but lost some momentum in early trading today. Data sources: CME Group, Standard & Poor\u2019s. Chart source: The thinkorswim\u00ae platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.\nHousing Market Trends\nThe latest, according to the S&P Core Logic Case-Shiller report out Tuesday, shows that home prices are on an upward climb. The National Home Price Index rose 0.7% in October after an upwardly revised 1% rise in September, according to the report. The biggest price hikes were seen in West Coast markets but the report added that there were notable price gains in Charlotte, Dallas and Tampa. Overall, there\u2019s been an 8.2% annualized price rise over the last three months.\n\u201cWhile home prices have rebounded past their previous highs in nominal terms, they remain lower after adjusting for inflation and rents,\u201d according to Wells Fargo\u2019s Economic Report. \u201cIn our view, talk of another bubble is still premature.\u201d\nThe Gift Card Waste\nWhy aren\u2019t we using all those gift cards? According to CEB TowerGroup, consumers spend more than $130 billion on gift cards each year. But roughly $1 billion\u2014with a b\u2014are left in drawers, wallets or, possibly the garbage, and unspent.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing worse than having a bunch of gift cards in your pocket you aren\u2019t going to use,\u201d Eddie Alberty, vice president of Strategic Partnerships at e-commerce site Market America and Shop.com, told MarketWatch. There\u2019s a solution: Tap into a growing number of apps and online exchanges that allow people to buy gift cards at a discount from the store price.\nHey Wearable Devices, What\u2019s My Temperature?\nTechnology companies are jumping into the healthcare space with continuous-monitoring tools like apps for watches and smartphones that might eventually help reduce disease and prolong lives, according to the New York Times. Ten of the largest U.S. tech companies shelled out $2.7 billion for healthcare-equity deals in the first 11 months of this year, data from research firm CB Insights showed. That\u2019s up from the $277 million the industry spent in all of 2012, the Times piece said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the early stages of learning these tools: Who do they help? Who do they not help? Who do they provide just angst, anxiety, false positives,\u201d Dr. Eric Topol, a digital medicine expert who directs the Scripps Translational Science Institute in San Diego, told the Times.\nInformation from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

Kinross was, in fact, one of the top-performing gold-mining stocks in 2017, but the market hasn't found a reason to pump more money into the stock so far this year.\nKinross shares took a deep dive earlier in the year after the miner reported fiscal 2017 numbers. Here's how it fared.\nMetric\nFY 2016\nFY 2017\nGold production (in ounces)\n2.67 million\n2.79 million\nRevenue\n$3.3 billion\n$3.47 billion\nNet profit/loss\n$445.4 million\n($104 million)\nAdjusted net profit\n$178.7 million\n$93 million\nAll-in sustaining cost (AISC) per gold equivalent ounce\n$954\n$984\nData source: Kinross Gold.\nFor fiscal 2018, Kinross expects:\nGold production of 2.5 million ounces\nAISC of $975 per ounce\nCapital expenditure of $1.1 billion compared with $897 million in 2017\nWhile asset impairments reversal and sale proceeds helped Kinross earn a big profit last year, lower production and higher cost estimates for 2018 didn't go down well with the market. Higher capital expenditures could also mean lower free cash flow (FCF) -- Kinross generated $54 million in FCF last year.\nNot every gold stock that's on sale is a buy. Image source: Getty Images.\nIn May, the market pummeled Kinross again for lower first-quarter profit. In reality, Q1 was a strong quarter, with revenue climbing 13% and AISC dipping to a record low of $846 per gold-equivalent ounce. Kinross' key phase one expansion at Tasiast is near completion and expected to boost throughput capacity to 12,000 tons per day during the latter half of the year. Other projects, including Round Mountain and Bald Mountain in Nevada and Fort Know Gilmore in Alaska, are also on schedule and budget.\nI don't see anything wrong with Kinross: It has a strong pipeline of projects that should boost production and lower costs over time, has ample liquidity at hand, strong cash flows, and no debt maturing until 2021. Gold investors might want to put Kinross' ill-timed investments in the rearview mirror and put the stock on their radar.\nLittle safety in this stock\nSibanye-Stillwater is in a free fall for the worst possible reason: the death of several workers within months. Twenty of the 45 fatalities in the South African mining industry so far this year have occurred at Sibanye's mines, as the nation's mineral resources minister, Gwede Mantashe, recently pointed out. Not surprisingly, the stock is tumbling.\nSibanye had already drawn investors' ire mid-last year when it announced a rights issue at a steep 60% discount to the then market price to raise funds to pare down a humongous $2.65 billion loan that it took to acquire platinum and palladium miner Stillwater Mining.\nManagement is planning to restructure operations, lower headcount, and enter streaming agreements in the near future to boost cash flows. Yet, it's a sorry state of affairs at Sibanye, more so with the onus to prove its commitment toward the safety of its workers larger than ever.\nThe recent fatalities will also likely hit production and could compel Sibanye to downgrade its full-year production guidance from 1.24 million ounces-1.29 million ounces of gold from South African operations and 1.1 million ounces-1.15 million ounces of platinum. Those estimates are lower than the miner's 2017 actual production, which leaves me with no reason whatsoever to recommend Sibanye today.\nThis gold stock has hit the danger mark\nFirst thing first, let's see how Eldorado Gold fared operationally in the past year or so.\nMetric\nFiscal 2017\nFiscal 2016\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\nGold production (in ounces)\n292,971\n312,299\n89,374\n$75,172 ounces\nRevenue\n$391.4 million\n$432.7 million\n$131.9 million\n$111.9 million\nNet profit/loss\n($9.9 million)\n($344.2 million)\n$8.7 million\n$6.8 million\nAISC (per ounce)\n$922\n$900\n$878\n$791\nData source: Eldorado Gold financials.\nEldorado Gold's net loss may have shrunk last year, but its loss from continuing operations (the miner sold off Chinese assets in 2016) were still higher. The miner clearly has a problem at hand: rising AISC.\nThe market blew up and sent Eldorado shares tumbling 40.9% in October last year after the miner downgraded its fiscal 2017 production estimates for its flagship Kisladag mine at Turkey for the second time. Investors were already worried about a more serious concern: The Greek government's initiation of arbitration proceedings against Eldorado to settle disputes over its key developing projects, including Skouries and Olympias mines.\nThe recent positive news from Greece and good Q1 numbers haven't helped as investors are clearly running out of patience, more so as there's been no update ever since the Greek government announced intentions to \"reach an agreement in the coming weeks\" more than a month ago. Meanwhile, Eldorado shares have already broken the crucial $1 mark at the time of this writing. If sustained, the company could be forced to go for a reverse stock split to stay listed on the New York Stock Exchange. That's not a great sign, and until there's substantive progress in Greece or some encouraging news coming out of Eldorado's second-quarter report due in a month's time, the stock remains a risky bet.\nNeha Chamaria has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

On June 26, its seventh mine, Cerro Moro, hit commercial production on time and within budget. It's a significant development, as Cerro Moro is expected to be among Yamana Gold's lowest-cost mines and a major contributor to its production and cash flows going forward.\nIt's time you pay attention to Yamana Gold. Image source: Getty Images.\nThis year, Cerro Moro should produce 85,000 gold ounces and 3.75 million silver ounces. By 2020, Yamana expects the mine to add 130,000 gold ounces and 8.3 million silver ounces. The company has other projects under expansion, including Canadian Malartic, Jacobina, and Minera Florida, all of which should push its production higher.\nImage source: Yamana Gold.\nThat translates into a production of 1.15 million gold equivalent ounces (GEOs) by 2020 compared to 892,000 GEOs produced in 2017. For the longer run, Yamana is developing projects like Chapada in Brazil to keep production flowing.\nYamana Gold's costs are expected to come down as production rises.\nCosts are headed down\nGiven the inherent volatility in gold prices, cost effectiveness is the key to profitability for gold miners. More and more gold miners are now focused on improving productivity to cut costs. Goldcorp, for instance, has outlined an ambitious plan to lower its all-in sustaining cost (AISC) by 20% between 2017 and 2020. Yamana has a plan up its sleeve as well.\nIn fiscal 2017, Yamana Gold reported by-product AISC of $888 per ounce of gold, or a 1% improvement over 2016. Cerro Moro is expected to improve Yamana Gold's cost profile considerably, starting this year, thanks to its projected 2018 AISC of only $650 per ounce of gold -- also the lowest among all of Yamana's mines except Chapada copper mine. That number looks even more significant when you realize that the company's three largest gold-producing mines each is expected to have AISC above $900 per ounce in 2018.",

Boeing was last down 2 percent while Caterpillar was down 0.7 percent.\nMore in News\nThe S&P 500's industrials sector (.SPLRCI) also pared losses but was still down 0.2 percent in late afternoon trading.\nThe technology sector (.SPLRCT) turned positive and was last up 0.6 percent, helped by Apple (AAPL.O) which turned positive and was last up 1.5 percent.\nChina's tariffs on U.S. soybean exports led to bets that higher domestic reserves would lower food costs for meat producers such as Tyson Foods (TSN.N), Hormel (HRL.N), Sanderson Farms (SAFM.O) and Pilgrim's Pride (PPC.O), helping those stocks.\nLennar (LEN.N) jumped 9.3 percent to lead the percentage gainers on the S&P after the homebuilder reported quarterly revenue that beat estimates as it sold more homes at higher prices.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.33-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.98-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\nThe S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and eight new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 30 new highs and 89 new lows.\n(Additional reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed and Herbert Lash in New York and Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Patrick Graham and James Dalgleish)",

The main reason for the miss according to Barrick stemmed from the US$405 million impairment charge at a mine in Peru.\nOn an adjusted basis, the company earned US$89 million, or US$0.08 per share, with total revenue hitting US$1.84 billion in the quarter. Operating cash flow and free cash flow in the quarter hit US$706 million and US$319 million, respectively.\nTurning to production and guidance, Barrick saw gold production in the quarter come in at 1.15 million ounces, with a cost-of-sales figure per ounce of US$850, and all-in sustaining costs came in at US$785 per ounce. Copper production hit 106 million pounds, with a cost of sales and all-in sustaining costs in the quarter coming in at US$2.18 per pound and US$2.71 per pound, respectively.\nFull-year guidance numbers for both remain unchanged, with gold production set to fall within 4.5-5.0 million ounces and copper production to be 345-410 million pounds.\nWhere will Barrick go next?\nAs Barrick transitions to becoming the largest miner on the planet, there are several areas of concerns that potential investors should contemplate.\nFirst, there\u2019s debt. Debt is an interesting, if not proud point of discussion for Barrick. In the years following the price collapse of gold in 2011, Barrick was straddled with over US$13 billion in debt. With an inefficient mining operation and deflated gold prices, the company turned its attention to debt reduction with a laser-like focus that has, to date, allowed Barrick to slash its debt in half, freeing up funds for acquisitions and growth, much like the Randgold deal.\nTurning to operations, Barrick is inheriting an enviable portfolio of mines from Randgold, which includes a number of mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo that other miners have struggled with in recent years, as well as the Lumwana copper mine in Zimbabwe. Whereas the focus of Lumwana will be to rein in costs, the Congo mines are higher-quality deposits that could prove lucrative to Barrick\u2019s bottom line.",

One of the partners was a great mining engineer with relevant know-how and management skills, others had expertise in IT, business development and international trade.''\nSudan Gold Coin is the first blockchain option in the world, where the value of the coin will be tied to the market price of gold. The total amount of tokens that will be released is 20,000,000 tokens without further additional releases. At the Pre-ICO stage, the price of one token was 0.5 $ USD, at the stage of ICO - 0.75 - 1 $ USD, depending on the stage. After purchasing tokens, each investor becomes the owner of a certain amount of gold, which he will be able to operate within a decentralized exchanger, built on a blockchain technology.\nInvestors and other users will be able to trade tokens, as well as exchange them for gold certificates in partner banks (in Dubai for example). The value of the token will grow due to the increase of gold's market value. The fact that some tokens will be redeemed from time to time (or exchanged for gold certificates) from investors, after that those tokens will be burned, so the ratio of tokens to the amount of gold will vary and the price of the token will grow.\nSGC project has successfully closed its Pre-ICO with a cap of 250,000$ USD. For now, the project is at Private Sale stage, there are undergoing preparations for the main ICO which will start on January 25th.",

He later told reporters his base case for Fed hikes this year was \u201ctwo to three, with the idea that data is going to come in to really inform how aggressively we can be moving our policy.\u201d\nAdditionally, Bostic said, \u201cMy main concern is that inflation expectations risk becoming anchored below 2 percent. If this happened, it would be increasingly difficult for the Fed to hit our 2 percent target.\nIn other news, San Francisco Fed President John Williams argued in favor of a price-level target during a presentation at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said he would prefer adopting an inflation range, rather than a precise target as the Fed currently does, because a range would give the Fed greater flexibility to allow for higher or lower inflation depending on how the economy is performing. He floated an inflation range of 1.5% to 3% as one that might be appropriate.\nU.S. Equity Indexes\nThe major U.S. stock indexes finished mixed on Monday with the S&P 500 Index and NASDAQ Composite Index closing at all-time highs and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing lower. The markets were generally supported by expectations of U.S. economic growth.\nThe S&P 500 Index was supported by a rise in nine of 11 sectors, led by utilities. The NASDAQ was led higher by strong performances in Facebook, Amazon, Google-parent Alphabet and Netflix. The Dow snapped a four-day winning streak on low volume.\nGold\nGold prices edged lower on Monday in reaction to a stronger U.S. Dollar. The Greenback was supported by expectations of more U.S. interest rate hikes this year. Investors have been driving U.S. Treasury yields higher since Friday\u2019s payrolls data did nothing to derail the outlook for monetary policy tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve later this year.

Gazprom Neft, the third-largest oil producer in Russia, decided to move away from the dollar and towards the yuan and other Asian currencies.\nIran followed suit the same year, using the yuan with a host of other foreign currencies in trade, including Iranian oil.\nDuring the same year China also developed its Silk Road, while the yuan was beginning to establish more dominance in the European markets.\nBut the U.S. petrodollar still had a fighting chance in 2015 because China\u2019s oil imports were all over the place. Back then, Nick Cunningham of OilPrice.com wrote\u2026\nDespite accounting for much of the world\u2019s growth in demand in the 21st Century, China\u2019s oil imports have been all over the map in recent months. In April, China imported 7.4 million barrels per day, a record high and enough to make it the world\u2019s largest oil importer. But a month later, imports plummeted to just 5.5 million barrels per day.\nThat problem has since gone away, signaling China\u2019s rise to oil dominance\u2026\nThe Slippery Slope to the Petroyuan Begins Here\nThe petrodollar is backed by Treasuries, so it can help fuel U.S. deficit spending. Take that away, and the U.S. is in trouble.\nIt looks like that time has come\u2026\n(Click to enlarge)\nA death blow that began in 2015 hit again in 2017 when China became the world\u2019s largest consumer of imported crude\u2026\nNow that China is the world\u2019s leading consumer of oil, Beijing can exert some real leverage over Saudi Arabia to pay for crude in yuan. It\u2019s suspected that this is what\u2019s motivating Chinese officials to make a full-fledged effort to renegotiate their trade deal.",

Silver prices averaged $16.57 per ounce in the second quarter, a decrease of 4% year over year. Platinum fell 4% year over year to $904 per ounce while palladium prices increased 20% year over year to $979 per ounce.\nFinancial Position\nFranco-Nevada\u2019s cash and cash equivalents fell to $72 million as of Jun 30, 2018, down substantially from $511 million as of Dec 31, 2017. The company recorded operating cash flow of $249 million for the six-month period ended Jun 30, 2018 compared with $239 million in the prior-year comparable period.\nFranco-Nevada has entered into a strategic relationship with Continental Resources, Inc. to acquire mineral rights in the SCOOP and STACK plays of Oklahoma. Franco-Nevada is contributing $220 million for the acquisition of existing mineral rights owned by a subsidiary of Continental. The company has committed, subject to satisfaction of agreed upon development thresholds, to spend up to $100 million annually over the next three years to acquire additional mineral rights through a newly-formed company.\nFranco-Nevada\u2019s board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 24 cents per share. The dividend will be paid on Sep 27, 2018 to shareholders of record on Sep 13, 2018.\nCorporate Updates\nCobre Panama: Franco-Nevada funded the additional precious metals stream on the Cobre Panama project for $356 million on Mar 16, 2018. Franco-Nevada now has exposure to the precious metals produced from 100% of the ownership of the Cobre Panama project.\n2018 Guidance\nFor 2018, Franco-Nevada expects attributable royalty and stream production from its mining assets to total 440,000 to 470,000 GEOs, lower than the previous expectation of 460,000 to 490,000 GEOs, to reflect reduced deliveries from the Candelaria stream.\nThe company now expects revenues between $65 million and $75 million from its oil & gas assets for 2018, up from its previous guidance of $50 million to $60 million. This is driven by better than expected contribution from its previously acquired U.S. assets and stronger oil prices.\nFor the guidance, silver, platinum and palladium metals have been converted to GEOs using assumed commodity prices of $1,250 per ounce of Gold, $16.00 per ounce of Silver, $850 per ounce of Platinum and $950 per ounce of Palladium. The WTI oil price is assumed to average $65 per barrel with a $4.80 per barrel price differential between the Edmonton Light and realized prices for Canadian oil.\nFor 2019, production will likely improve at Candelaria. The company will also benefit from the ramp-up of its major precious metals stream at Cobre Panama. Further, the company will continue to witness growth from its U.S. oil & gas assets aided by the new Continental relationship.\nThe company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The shares of Franco-Nevada have dropped 4.4% over the past year, compared with the industry\u2019s decline of 12.3%.\nOther Stocks\nSome better-ranked stocks in the same sector include Ingevity Corporation NGVT, KMG Chemicals, Inc. KMG and Ashland Global Holdings Inc. ASH. While Ingevity and KMG Chemicals sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Ashland Global carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nIngevity has a long-term earnings growth rate of 12%.

Its shares have been up 40% in the past year.\nAshland Global has a long-term earnings growth rate of 10%. The company\u2019s shares have gained 40% over the past year.\nThe Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All\nLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

President Sergio Mattarella rejected the nomination of Paolo Savona for finance minister, the 81-year-old eurosceptic who has long been an advocate for an Italian exit from the eurozone. This move has sparked fears that snap elections could follow as soon as this fall, and this time the entire European project would be on the table if hard-right-wing populists were to prevail.\nMarkets reacted and punished Italian sovereign bonds with worst day in more than 25 years. On May 29, the 2-year yield spiked more than 150 basis points to 2.73%, while the 10-year bond yields jumped 50 basis points to their highest level in over four years at 3.38%. Also, the cost of insuring exposure to Italian risk in the five-year credit default swaps market rose to a four-year high of 225 basis points.\nThe fears were somewhat muted once President Mattarella accepted a compromise and named both leaders of the two populist parties who won most votes in March in a coalition government. Still, European leaders are worried that the highly indebted nation, with a government debt-to-GDP ratio of 131%, cannot withstand more financial shocks as the one recently provoked by its politicians. Some 48% of all government bonds, well over one trillion euros, are held by Italian banks, insurers and small savers.\nOil Market Is Trying to Find Ground\nDespite a sharp fall in prices over the last 10 days, Oil seems to get closer to finding support as the high demand season commences and the global economic backdrop is encouraging. The subject attracted attention, boosting viewership by 126% as investors looked for clues as to whether the recent slump has further steam or is approaching a solid bid.\nSign up for ETFdb.com Pro and get access to real-time ratings on over 1,900 U.S.-listed ETFs.\nAfter discussing boosting output, Saudi Arabia and Russia signaled a willingness to gradually increase exports in order to compensate for supply losses from Venezuela and Iran. U.S. sanctions on Iran could trim its oil exports by 400,000 to 500,000 barrels a day, but it is not yet clear if the largest buyers of Iranian oil \u2013 China and India \u2013 would derail from current contracts. Both nations are posting record levels of crude imports, consuming over a million barrels of Iranian oil daily between them, meaning they need as many suppliers as possible.\nAs the official gathering of OPEC nears, some participating countries met in advance, over the weekend, and displayed decisiveness to cooperate in balancing global supply. In addition, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that the U.S. government had asked Saudi Arabia and some other OPEC producers to increase oil production by about 1 million barrels per day.\nInvesco DB Oil Fund (DBO B+) lost some of its vigors over the last two weeks, shedding nearly 8% in value since its late-May high but still holds a solid 15.57% year-to-date performance. However, increasing U.S. production is putting pressure on prices, while a possible OPEC decision regarding an output hike hinders any chances of a rally.\nInvestors Back to Gold as Trade War Fears Return\nInvestors sought out safe havens in the wake of another round of trade spats between the U.S. and its global partners. Gold was in demand as traffic intensified and surged by 121% over the last week. The benchmark and largest ETF in the sector, SPDR Gold Trust (GLD A-), traded sideways of late but managed to stop the bleeding that began in mid-April and sank prices into negative territory for the year.\nFor a deeper analysis on individual ETF investments such as (GLD A-) or (EEM A-), use our ETF Analyzer Tool. You can select ETFs by Category or Type as well as add individual ticker symbols to compare performance, expenses and dividend yield, among other metrics.\nThe rise in geopolitical tensions provided thrust for the precious metal but the effect was relatively short-lived as Italy jitters faded over the weekend. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, also provided support for gold prices as it fell from 2018 highs.\nLast Tuesday, U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yields registered their largest one-day drop in nearly two years. That\u2019s good news for gold, as higher rates could dent demand for the non-yielding bullion.\nEmerging Markets Equities\nEmerging Markets Equities recouped some of the losses posted in May as the greenback and oil slid while yields on U.S. Treasury notes backtracked from seven-year highs. Viewership in the asset class grew by 88% in the last week as investors are pondering a return to the battered equities.\nHealthy gains in tech stocks lifted emerging market equities to a three-week high on Tuesday, while the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM A-) rose nearly 4% in the last six trading days.\nThis spring has been quite challenging for equities based in emerging markets as figures from the Institute of International Finance published on Tuesday showed a heavy sell-off in emerging markets. Foreign investors dumped a combined $12.3 billion of emerging markets bonds and stocks in May, triggered by a combination of higher U.S. interest rates, a rally in the dollar and an upsurge in oil prices.\nCanada Retaliates with Its Own Set of Tariffs\nThe U.S. administration\u2019s decision to end exemptions on steel and aluminum imports from Canada spurred interest in the country while causing a jump in traffic of 73% over the past five days.\nAs NAFTA talks stalled and no major breakthrough took place, the U.S. announced that it would go ahead and impose the 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum tariffs on its allies, Canada, Mexico and the European Union. Canada got hit the most as it exports 90% of its steel and 84% of the aluminum it produces to the U.S., more than any other country. The Canadian steel and aluminum industry employs around 30,000 people across the country, while tariffs are estimated to cost the economy in excess of $3.2 billion a year.\nIn a swift response, Canadian authorities issued a list of more than 100 U.S. products, ranging from motorcycles to bourbon, that will be hit by tariffs starting July 1. The resolution is targeting roughly $12.8 billion worth of goods in a tit-for-tat measure.\nThe largest ETF with exposure to the Canadian economy, iShares MSCI Canada ETF (EWC C+), reacted strongly to the trade spat between the two historic allies, losing 2.2% in the two days after the U.S. ruling only to recover briskly. However, the ETF is still slightly in the red for the year.\nTo find out more about ETFs exposed to particular countries, use our ETF Country Exposure tool. Select a particular country from a world map and get a list of all ETFs tracking your pick.\nThe Bottom Line\nItaly was the primary subject on investors\u2019 radars as political confrontations provoked trepidations across financial markets while affecting the nation\u2019s capacity of funding cheaply its sky-high indebted economy. Talks between the world\u2019s largest oil producers about a hike in output were offset by strong global demand prospects, especially from China and India. Despite lingering concerns about trade wars between the United States and the rest of the world, investors feel hesitant when considering building positions in gold, while emerging markets equities found support from a declining dollar and falling yields for the U.S. Treasury notes. Lastly, Canada prepares for a new phase in trade relations with the U.S. as it responded to steel and aluminum tariffs with a wide array of import taxes on American goods.",

The dollar on the other hand, has a significant correlation with gold prices. Inflation and interest rates also have an impact.

However, the intraday declines recovered as the currency pair managed to close slightly bullish. Price action was seen closing near 1.1695 on Friday\u2019s close which marks the previously breached support level. A rebound off this level is required in order to confirm the upside in prices. If the EURUSD posts a reversal near this price level we expect to see further declines that could send the common currency falling toward 1.1600 regions.\nUSDJPY intra-day analysis\nUSDJPY (112.48): The USDJPY currency pair rallied to a six month high on Friday before giving up the gains. Price action quickly reversed back to 112.28 level. As long as this minor support holds, the currency pair could be seen consolidating at the currency levels. In the event of a break down below this level, then USDJPY could extend the losses toward the next lower support at 111.13. However, the major falling trend line is expected to act as dynamic support in the short term.\nXAUUSD intra-day analysis\nXAUUSD (1243.21): Gold prices were seen posting declines on the day as price touched fresh intraday lows of 1240.81. The recovery in the declines saw gold prices trading back near the price level of 1242. A breakout above this level is required to confirm the upside momentum that could be building up. Failure to close above 1247 could, however, trigger further gains that could push the price of spot gold toward the 1258 handle. To the downside, we expect to see price action consolidating at the current levels.",

I wouldn't be surprised if this buying continues.\"\nThe dollar fell against the euro on Wednesday. Traders said there was little news to support the euro's rise, though some investors have positioned for a possible strengthening in the single currency into the new year following a stellar 2017, its best year versus the greenback since 2003. [FRX/]\nDespite a relatively static fourth quarter, gold is up 10 percent this year, on track for its biggest annual rise since 2010. Weakness in the dollar, geopolitical concerns centring on North Korea, and receding expectations that U.S. interest rates would be raised quickly all fed into its strength.\nThe metal is now running into some resistance around key chart levels, traders said.\n\"Technically, the 38.2 percent of the move down from the 2017 high of $1,357 comes in at $1,282,\" Amit Kumar Gupta, portfolio management services head at Adroit Financial Services, said. \"The 100-day moving average is at $1,286. So, these levels will be watched for further moves.\"\nMore in News\nAmong other precious metals, palladium rose over 1 percent to its highest since February 2001 at $1,069.50 an ounce - just $5.50 an ounce from that month's peak - before edging back to $1,056.50, up 0.5 percent.\nPalladium has been the best performer of the precious metals complex in 2017, up more than 50 percent as years of deficit and expectations for rising demand from the car industry bolstered the investment case for the autocatalyst metal.\n\"Investors perceive the market to be very tight,\" INTL FCStone said in a note.\nSilver was 0.3 percent higher at $16.59 an ounce, having earlier reached its highest since late November at $16.65, while platinum was up 0.3 percent at $921.02 an ounce.\n(Additional reporting by Apeksha Nair and Nallur Sethuraman in Bengaluru; Editing by Mark Potter and Louise Heavens)",

(BTO:TSX) with regards to our exploration tenements at Mupane.\nDuring April 2018, the Company produced 4,004 ounces of gold which represents its best monthly output since February 2014. To achieve this, it milled 73,234 tonnes at an average head grade of 2.45 grams per tonne. The main contributor to this was production from Tau of 34,898 tonnes at 3.80 grams per tonne.\nGalane Gold CEO, Nick Brodie commented: \u201cThe first quarter of 2018 was slightly behind our internal targets due to the failure of the ball mill motor at the beginning of the year. The motor was fixed by the end of March 2018 and we were able to recommence full production in April 2018 with additional Tau ore contributing to the exceptional result.\nThe Galaxy project continues with work progressing on the completion of the detailed engineering of the new plant and mining schedules for both the Princeton and Galaxy ore bodies.(1) It is still our intention to commence the re-commissioning of the project in July 2018.\u201d\nAbout Galane Gold\nGalane Gold is an un-hedged gold producer and explorer with mining operations and exploration tenements in Botswana and South Africa.

The company managed to dig out 823,264 ounces of the precious metal last year (along with an additional 273,063 ounces from its stake in Brio Gold and the Gualcamayo, which the company is in the process of selling). While that's a significant number, it wasn't enough to get it into the list of the world's top 10 miners, and it was well below leading gold producer Barrick Gold and its 5.32 million ounces.\nYamana also produces silver and copper, digging out 5 million ounces and 127.3 million pounds, respectively, in 2017. It's far from the leader in either category, however, and those metals don't supply more revenue to Yamana than gold, which is how it makes most of its money. In 2017, the company sold $1.8 billion in metals, with 79% of that total from gold sales, 16% from copper, and 5% from silver.\nOperating mines\nYamana produces from several mines in the Americas, including in Canada, Brazil, Chile, and Argentina:\nMine\nLocation\nAmount of Metal Mined (2017)\nAISC of Mine (2017)\nChapada\nBrazil\n119,852 ounces gold; 127.3 million pounds copper\n$385 per ounce\nEl Penon\nChile\n160,509 ounces gold; 4.28 million ounces silver\n$928 per ounce of gold; $12.77 per ounce of silver\nCanadian Malartic\nCanada\n316,731 ounces gold\n$742 per ounce\nJacobina\nBrazil\n135,806 ounces gold\n$867 per ounce\nMinera Florida\nChile\n90,366 ounces gold; 469,674 ounces silver\n$1,090 per ounce\nCerro Moro\nArgentina\nNone in 2017\nN/A\nData source: Yamana Gold. AISC = all-in sustaining cost.\nAs you can see, the biggest contributor is the Canadian Malartic mine, which the company owns as part of a 50/50 joint venture (JV) with Agnico Eagle Mines. The open-pit mine is one of the largest in Canada and boasts a low all-in sustaining cost (AISC) that was below the companywide average of $820 an ounce in 2017.\nAnother notable mine in Yamana's portfolio is El Penon, because it supplies the bulk of the company's silver output. Chapada is also notable, because it is the lowest-cost mine in the company's portfolio and contributes all the company's copper production.\nAs mentioned earlier, Yamana received some production from assets it plans to sell. One of those is the Gualcamayo open-pit mine in Argentina, which produced 154,052 ounces of gold in 2017 at an elevated AISC of $990 an ounce. While the company is pursuing alternatives to maximize the value of this high-cost mine, the current plan is to sell it. The company also held a 53% stake in Brio Gold, which owned several mines in Brazil, entitling Yamana to 119,011 ounces of gold in 2017. Yamana created Brio and completed an initial public offering (IPO) of the company in 2016 before agreeing to sell the rest of the shares it owned to Leagold Mining Corporation in 2018.\nHelping replace some of the output from those departing assets will be the Cerro Moro gold-silver mine in Argentina. Yamana started construction on this mine in 2015 and is expected to finish it in 2018. The company estimates that the mine will produce 85,000 ounces of gold and 3.75 million ounces of silver in 2018 at low costs of $650 and $9.15 an ounce, respectively. In the coming years, the company sees output ramping up to 130,000 ounces of gold and 7 million ounces of silver.\nHistory and acquisitions\nFormer banker Peter Marrone founded Yamana Gold in 2003. While its headquarters were (and still are) in Canada, the company initially operated gold and copper mines in Brazil that it acquired in a reverse takeover of a struggling company called Yamana Resources in that country.\nMarrone laid out his strategic vision for Yamana in 2005, aiming to increase production up to 750,000 ounces of gold by 2008. That goal led the company to acquire RNC Gold for 49 million Canadian dollars (US$39 million at today's exchange rate) toward the end of that year, adding mines in Nicaragua and Honduras as well as an advanced development property and other exploration targets in Central America. That deal bolstered the company's output to 400,000 ounces in 2006 and put it on pace for 650,000 ounces by 2008. The company followed that deal a few months later by paying CA$574 million in stock to buy Desert Sun Mining. That deal added a mine in Brazil near another of Yamana's locations as well as one under development. It also increased the company's output to 450,000 ounces in 2006 and put it on pace for 800,000 by 2008.\nA few months later, the company acquired Viceroy Exploration to solidify its position as a leading intermediate gold producer. The draw was Viceroy's advanced-stage Gualcamayo gold project, which, along with Yamana's other development-stage projects at the time, would help hoist production to 1 million ounces by 2008, well past its initial strategic vision.\nIn 2007, the company made two more deals, combining with Northern Orion Resources and then Meridian Gold. The company paid CA$3.5 billion for Meridian, which would make it a 1.5 million-ounce producer by 2009.\nYamana finally made an acquisition in its home country of Canada in 2014, when it teamed up with Agnico Eagle to buy Osisko Mining for CA$3.9 billion. The companies formed a joint acquisition entity, with each owning 50%, to gain control of its Canadian Malartic mine.\nDebt\nYamana Gold's steady stream of acquisitions grew the size of the company over the years. However, these deals haven't created any value for investors. In fact, Yamana's share price is currently below where it was in 2003. One factor is that the company took on a significant amount of debt in recent years to acquire the stake in Canadian Malartic as well as to build Cerro Moro. That debt started weighing on the stock as the price of gold came off its peak.\nThe company has since started chipping away at this debt by selling more shares and parting with non-core assets like Brio Gold and the exploration properties it acquired along with the Canadian Malartic mine, which it sold to its partner, Agnico Eagle. These moves have given the company the liquidity it needs to finish building Cerro Moro, which is a key driver of its future growth.\nCurrent business focus\nLike many of its larger gold-producing peers, Yamana Gold has shifted its focus away from trying to build a gold mining empire and instead aims to grow shareholder value by increasing cash flow. Cerro Moro is a crucial step in that direction given the low-cost silver and gold it will provide the company. That mine will help expand the company's gold output at a 5.6% compound annual rate through 2020, pushing it up to 970,000 ounces. Silver production, meanwhile, should grow at an even faster 37% yearly pace, hitting 12.9 million ounces in 2020. This low-cost output will deliver a \"step change in cash flow\" in the second half of 2018, according to the company's projections. In Yamana's view, it will generate an amount of free cash flow through 2019 that is \"disproportionate to market capitalization\" (which was $2.8 billion in early 2018).\nImage source: Getty Images.\nIs Yamana Gold stock a buy?\nYamana Gold is about to hit a turning point. The once financially strapped gold producer should transform into a free-cash-flow machine over the next three years if the price of gold cooperates. The company believes it could produce more than $500 million in free cash flow through the end of 2019. For a company with a market cap of less than $3 billion, that's a significant windfall.\nIt's upside that the company believes isn't reflected in its stock price since Yamana sells for around five times expected 2018 cash flow per share. For comparison's sake, most peers trade for about eight times, while the highest one fetches approximately 14 times anticipated 2018 cash flow per share. These numbers suggest that Yamana Gold is significantly undervalued compared to those rivals. That cheap price tag, when combined with its growth potential, gives investors plenty of reasons to love what they see ahead. While Yamana's stock likely doesn't have millionaire-maker potential, it seems to have significant upside in the near term as long as the price of gold cooperates, making it a compelling gold stock to consider buying on that turnaround potential alone.\nMatthew DiLallo has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

        "summary": "Investing.com - Gold prices held steady on Monday, as the U.S. dollar mildly weakened after broadly strengthening thanks to Friday's upbeat U.S. nonfarm payrolls report.

Today, gold is still used for decoration and jewelry; it's a hedge against inflation, and an industrial commodity. And despite no longer being used as currency, it is still worth a great deal -- at this writing, $1,242 an ounce.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nBut make no mistake, its value has swung and will continue to swing as time goes on. The only sure way for investors to make money off the precious metal is to invest in gold companies that make a profit no matter what happens to gold prices -- stocks like Royal Gold(NASDAQ: RGLD), Goldcorp(NYSE: GG), and Wheaton Precious Metals(NYSE: SLW).\nHere's what you need to know about these three top gold stocks to get started with your own research.\n1. Royal Gold\nRoyal Gold is what is known as a precious metals \"streamer.\" It has royalty claims on gold, silver, copper, lead, and zinc at mines in over 20 countries -- but it doesn't own mines. In exchange for capital, mine owners give Royal Gold working interests in the production of precious minerals. This has led to some pretty hefty profit margins for the company, especially when compared to traditional miners like Barrick Gold and Yamana Gold:\nRoyal Gold has interests in 34 producing properties, 21 development-stage properties, and 131 exploration-stage properties scattered across Canada, the United States, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Chile, Australia, and Africa.\nInvestors can expect solid growth from Royal Gold's interests. The company just recently began receiving copper deliveries from its Mount Milligan mine in Canada. Royal Gold's partner in the mine, Centerra Gold, Inc., also upped its production estimates for the mine as part of its third-quarter earnings release. The mine is a prime example of how Royal Gold operates: In exchange for just under $800 million, it has the right to 35% of all the gold and 18.75% of the copper for the life of the mine, at far-below-market rates. Also of note is that this particular mine has an estimated life of 22 years, thanks to over 2.1 billion pounds of copper and 5.8 million ounces of gold in proven and probable reserves.\nMount Milligan is just one example of the power of Royal Gold's business model, and its merits as a top gold stock.\n2. Goldcorp\nThough it was founded in 1994, Goldcorp didn't hit its stride until the turn of the millennium. Then, in 2000, Goldcorp founder Rob McEwen came up with a unique idea to give his business a boost. He launched the \"Goldcorp Challenge,\" sharing the company's geological data to the public and offering $575,000 in prizes to people who could find the gold. The idea was remarkably successful, with some 110 sites identified; approximately 80% of those mining sites yielded enormous gold discoveries. \"The challenge\" helped turn the company into what it is today.\nAs has been pointed out by my colleague Matt DiLallo, Goldcorp has some of the largest and lowest-cost gold reserves in the world. These assets are led by its 40% stake in the Pueblo Viejo mine in the Dominican Republic (one of the largest gold mines on the planet), and its wholly owned Penasquito mine in Mexico. These and other mines make up the company's enormous proved and probable reserve base of 41.8 million ounces of gold.\nSuch a sizable (and cost-effective) portfolio of mining reserves allowed the company to produce 2.87 million ounces of gold last year, at all-in sustaining costs (a useful metric for mining companies that takes into account current production and reserve replacement expenses) of $856 per ounce. With sizable reserves and competitive cost structures, plans to increase annual production, and its total reserves aggressive through fiscal year 2021, Goldcorp is a must-consider gold stock.\n3. Wheaton Precious Metals\nThough once called Silver Wheaton, Wheaton Precious Metals is now a bona fide precious-metal streaming powerhouse. It has interests in numerous world-class assets, including silver and gold streams at Hudbay Minerals' Constancia project and Vale S.A.'s Salobo and Sudbury mines. All told, Wheaton Precious Metals has around 20 precious-metal streaming agreements with the most respected mining companies in the world, including Goldcorp, Vale, Glencore, and Barrick Gold.\nRecent results have been less enthralling. Gold production for the third quarter fell 15% year over year, but this was expected, because Wheaton ratcheted down its share of the gold produced in a few of its mines.\nLooking toward the future, things get a little more shiny. Management reiterated its production guidance for the year in its third-quarter conference call, estimating the company will produce 340,000 ounces of gold and 28 million ounces of silver for fiscal 2017. This figure is expected to hold steady for the next five years -- which is a boon for investors, as it doesn't include the company's share of Barrick Gold's Pascua-Lama project or Hudbay's Rosemont mine. In a recent investor presentation, management noted that should these stakes play out as expected, Wheaton would see an estimated 45% increase in total silver and gold production.\nLastly, with the ship holding steady, management took the opportunity following Q3's results to declare a quarterly dividend of $0.09 per share -- 50% higher than last year. This payout has plenty of room to run as it is set at 30% of the company's average operating cash flow from its previous four quarters.\nThe Foolish bottom line\nThe blunt truth is that commodity production can be a tough business. Mining companies and streamers are price takers. Success or failure partially depends upon the whims of supply and demand. However, by focusing on gold stocks that have an edge, Foolish investors can have the last laugh when it comes to gold stocks. Royal Gold, Goldcorp, and Wheaton Precious Metals all have unique attributes that make them long-term winners, no matter what gold prices do.\nSean O'Reilly has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

The new levies come during a week when representatives from the two nations are reportedly scheduled for talks. But it remains to be seen whether the world\u2019s two largest economies can make substantive progress on a trade dispute that has had many market watchers on edge about global economic growth prospects.\nThe other main recent geopolitical concern has been surrounding recent weakness in Turkey\u2019s currency, but worries on that front seem to have died down.\nIn addition to the calendar of companies reporting earnings results being relatively light this week, economic reports are also relatively sparse. So investors may have more time to focus on Federal Reserve comments about monetary policy, the economy, and inflation.\nFed Watch\nMinutes from the August Fed meeting are scheduled for release tomorrow afternoon. And the Fed\u2019s annual Economic Policy Symposium begins the following day in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak Friday morning.\nIf he says anything about cost pressures and wage growth, investors may want to consider zooming in on those comments and comparing them with what company leadership has said in the recent earnings season about higher materials and pay costs as inflation has climbed above the Fed\u2019s long-term goal of 2 percent.\nIn other Fed news, President Donald Trump in an interview with Reuters said he would continue criticizing the Fed if it keeps raising interest rates. The comments appear to have pressured the dollar (see Figure 1 below).\nMarket Roundup\nU.S. equities started off the week in classic late-summer fashion. Trading volumes for stocks on the three main indices were below average, with volume for S&P 500 equities roughly half of what it averages.\nLower volumes can be typical for this time of year as many traders take time off for vacation. While those lower volumes can exacerbate the stock market moves either up or down, Monday\u2019s gains for the three major indices were relatively muted, especially for the Nasdaq Composite (COMP), which gained just 0.06 percent.\nThe backdrop for the modest gains in stocks appeared to be a lessening in worry about global trade and the Turkish economy. While trade tensions between the U.S. and major trading partners have been dogging Wall Street for some time, the worries about the Turkish currency have flared up more recently. The trade issue has led to worry about global economic growth while the Turkey situation has generated fears about banks with exposure to the nation, which is suffering from high inflation. But those concerns appeared to take a back seat Monday.\nOil and gold also posted gains. The dollar fell a bit against a basket of other major currencies. And in a reflection of the relatively chill mood on Wall Street on Monday, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), often referred to as the market\u2019s fear gauge, dropped.\nIn earnings news, Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT) is scheduled to release its earnings report before market open tomorrow. For Q2, TGT is expected to report adjusted EPS of $1.40 on revenue of $17.29 billion, according to third-party consensus analyst estimates. That estimate is right in the middle of management\u2019s guidance for adjusted EPS between $1.30 and $1.50. In the same quarter last year, adjusted EPS came in at $1.23 on revenue of $16.43 billion.\nFIGURE 1: Figure 1: Gold Awakens: After falling precipitously over the last three weeks to well below $1,200 an ounce, gold started to show signs of life this week. The dollar (purple line) could be playing a role in that, as it\u2019s leveled off after relentlessly climbing to one-year highs. A strong dollar can often help push gold prices lower. Data Source: ICE, CME Group. Chart source: The thinkorswim\u00ae platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.\nUS, International EPS Forecasts\nOne question that may be on investors\u2019 minds is how long the boost from Washington\u2019s tax cut may continue helping the market. S&P 500 earnings per share growth this year is projected to hit 23 percent, according to investment research firm CFRA, citing benefit from the tax cut. But the lofty earnings this year mean that estimates have been reduced for 2019 because of the high bar to hurdle, the research firm said. That\u2019s not the case outside of the U.S. though, as CFRA said the trend is reversed overseas, citing S&P Capital IQ consensus estimates of 4.6 percent growth in 2018 operating EPS for the S&P Developed ex-US BMI (Broad Market Index) compared with 8.7 percent next year.\nHeadwinds for Existing Home Sales\nOne piece of economic data the market is expecting this week is July existing home sales, scheduled for release Wednesday morning. According to Wells Fargo Securities, low inventories remain the main problem holding sales back even though total inventories rose in June. \u201cShortages remain a barrier to sales, especially in the South and West,\u201d Wells Fargo said in a note. Meanwhile, the median price of an existing home hit a fresh all-time high in June. \u201cHigher home prices and rising mortgage rates risk putting homeownership out of reach for more households,\u201d according to Wells Fargo.\nGood News On Dividend Front\nDespite worries about global economic growth that have dogged the market of late, company payouts to shareholders have been on the rise. Globally, dividends grew 12.9 percent year-on-year in Q2 to a record $497.4 billion, while U.S.-company payouts rose 4.5 percent to a record $117.1 billion, according to Janus Henderson. \u201cReading the headlines in the financial press, investors might assume that times are tough and getting tougher,\u201d Janus Henderson said in a report. \u201cTrade wars, political uncertainty and an aging U.S. bull market are among the common themes of late. Dividend payouts paint a far more upbeat picture, one of strong corporate balance sheets, continued management confidence and, consequently, significant dividend growth.\u201d\nInformation from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

Analysts at Piper Jaffray were positive on the Latin American e-commerce giant, repeating their prior stock rating of overweight but boosting their price target by more than 20% to $330 per share. MercadoLibre has shown solid fundamental progress as the Latin American economy has rebounded lately, and continued encouraging performance from key commodity markets that form the backbone of many national economies across the region could continue to bode well for a rising consumer class and its ability to fuel e-commerce growth.\nImage source: MercadoLibre.\nCenturyLink connects with optimism\nCenturyLink stock picked up 7% in the wake of positive comments from analysts at Morgan Stanley. Those following the stock for the Wall Street giant said that 2017 has been a difficult one for the telecom industry, especially for companies with exposure to old-style wireline assets like CenturyLink. However, unlike some of its peers, CenturyLink has the advantage of having combined forces with Level 3, and those who are bullish on the telecom company think that larger scale and greater diversity in business could help it stand out from other companies with substantial landline exposure. Even with today's gain, CenturyLink is still down nearly 40% in just the past six months.\nGoldcorp gets a lift\nFinally, shares of Goldcorp rose 6%. The gold market gained ground today, with bullion rising more than $10 per ounce to $1,255. Ordinarily, news of an interest rate hike from the Federal Reserve would be bearish for gold mining companies like Goldcorp, because higher rates mean greater financing costs for commodity investors who own gold or have investment positions in the yellow metal. Yet some investors see the Fed decision as being less hawkish than it might have been, and the prospects of a little pain now in exchange for less-dramatic future moves could help support gold prices. Goldcorp has large and growing gold reserves, and that puts the mining giant in great position to benefit if gold holds onto its gains and keeps moving higher.",

Gazprom Neft, the third-largest oil producer in Russia, decided to move away from the dollar and towards the yuan and other Asian currencies.\nIran followed suit the same year, using the yuan with a host of other foreign currencies in trade, including Iranian oil.\nDuring the same year China also developed its Silk Road, while the yuan was beginning to establish more dominance in the European markets.\nBut the U.S. petrodollar still had a fighting chance in 2015 because China\u2019s oil imports were all over the place. Back then, Nick Cunningham of OilPrice.com wrote\u2026\nDespite accounting for much of the world\u2019s growth in demand in the 21st Century, China\u2019s oil imports have been all over the map in recent months. In April, China imported 7.4 million barrels per day, a record high and enough to make it the world\u2019s largest oil importer. But a month later, imports plummeted to just 5.5 million barrels per day.\nThat problem has since gone away, signaling China\u2019s rise to oil dominance\u2026\nThe Slippery Slope to the Petroyuan Begins Here\nThe petrodollar is backed by Treasuries, so it can help fuel U.S. deficit spending.

The year-over-year improvement in overall revenues came on the back of new production from the Fekola Mine and an increase of 3% in the average realized gold price, partially offset by lower sales volumes due to the timing of gold shipments from the Otjikoto and Masbate mines.\nMine Updates\nThe new Fekola Mine, which is in its second full-quarter of commercial operations, is performing ahead of plan. It produced 112,644 ounces of gold in the quarter or 11% above budget. Backed by its strong year-to-date performance, B2Gold hiked Fekola\u2019s annual production guidance to 420,000-430,000 ounces of gold from the previous 400,000 to 410,000 ounces.\nProduction at the Masbate Mine increased 9% and came in line at the Otjikoto Mine, both compared with the prior-year quarter levels. Both exceeded their targeted production levels for the quarter.For the Masbate Mine, the company now anticipates full-year production to be at or above the top end of its original annual production guidance range of between 180,000 and 190,000 ounces of gold, at cash operating costs of between $675 and $720 per ounce and AISC of between $875 and $925 per ounce.\nFor 2018, production from the Otjikoto Mine is expected between 160,000 ounces and 170,000 ounces of gold, primarily from the Otjikoto Pit, at cash operating costs in the range of $480-$525 per ounce and AISC in the range of $700-$750 per ounce.\nA Record First-Half Performance\nGold production was a record 479,777 ounces in the first half of 2018. The figure was 89% higher than the production of 225,593 ounces in the comparable period last year and also came in 7% above the company\u2019s budget.\nDuring the first half B2Gold sold a record 480,575 ounces of gold at an average price of $1,309 per ounce, resulting in record revenues of $629 million. Compared with the prior year, revenues soared 103%, primarily attributable to the new production from the Fekola Mine, an increase of 7% in the average realized gold price and the positive impact from the timing of gold shipments (including 27,450 ounces sold in the first quarter which related to Fekola's Dec 31, 2017 finished gold inventory).\nProjects Higher Gold Production for 2018\nFor 2018, the company now projects a higher annual gold production between 920,000 ounces and 960,000 ounces compared with its previous guidance between 910,000 ounces and 950,000 ounces. From 2017 levels, this guidance reflects an approximately 300,000 ounces increase.\nCash operating costs are expected between $505 and $550 per ounce and all-in sustaining costs (\u201cAISC\u201d) are expected to range between $780 and $830 per ounce.\nGoing Forward\nWith the new Fekola Mine contributing to the production, the resulting increase in production levels along with low costs is likely to boost B2Gold's production, revenues, cash from operations and cash flow in the years ahead. On average over the next three years, beginning in 2018, the company projects per annum gold sales revenues of approximately $1.2 billion, cash flow from operations of approximately $0.5 billion and a significant increase in free cash flow.\nThe company intends to remain focused on continuing its impressive operational and financial performance from existing mines. Simultaneously, it will try to reduce its debt burden, explore expansion opportunities at existing operations and continue with aggressive exploration and development programs to unlock the potential of its existing portfolio of properties.\nB2Gold has underperformed the industry over the past year.

The Property is subject to the terms of a letter agreement with an underlying vendor signed in November 2017 (for further details see Nevada Sunrise news release dated November 21, 2017 ).\nTwo site visits by consulting geologists to Nevada Sunrise were completed in November and December 2017 , and a total of 28 rock samples have been collected and submitted for analysis. Rocks sampled include historical mine waste, and bedrock occurrences within and around the various adits and shafts that are accessible at the Lovelock Mine site. A 53-element analytical package, including platinum group metals, has been ordered by the Company and geochemical results are expected in early January 2018 .\nIn addition, an initial 4.2 kilometre DC induced polarization/resistivity (\"DC-IP\") survey consisting of stations spaced 25 to 50 metres apart on five lines has been completed by SJ Geophysics of Delta, B.C. , using their proprietary Volterra acquisition system. The Volterra system allows crews to navigate around challenging terrain features such as lakes, swamps and cliffs or to adjust station locations to optimize ground contact. This DC-IP survey, projected to have a depth of investigation of approximately 250 metres (820 feet), is very likely the first ground geophysical program ever completed at the Property. In-depth processing and modelling of the data is underway and the Company plans to integrate the results with mapped geology to develop targets for a first-pass drilling program in the spring of 2018. There are no known historical drill holes at the Lovelock Mine.\n\"The Lovelock Mine is literally a time capsule never tested by modern exploration methods,\" said Warren Stanyer , President and CEO of Nevada Sunrise. \"Our preliminary geophysical survey results show chargeability responses that could represent deeper zones of mineralization than the miners of the 1880s ever reached. The exploration goal at the Lovelock Mine is to find a deep-seated source for the historical cobalt mineralization.\"\nAbout the Lovelock Mine\nThe Lovelock Mine property area consists of 37 unpatented claims in the Cottonwood Canyon area of Stillwater range totaling approximately 740 acres (300 hectares). It was reportedly discovered by George Lovelock and Charles Bell about 1880. According to U.S. Government annual reports, the Lovelock Mine saw limited production of nickel, copper and cobalt beginning in 1883. The primary cobalt mineral was identified as \"cobaltite\", a compound of cobalt, sulphur and arsenic with some nickel replacement of cobalt normal. Records of a geochemical analysis from that era indicate that the average composition of the cobaltite contained 17.30% cobalt and 13.62% nickel. The mine operated from 1883 to 1890 to the 100-foot level, reporting 500 tons of concentrated cobalt and nickel mineralized material shipped to England for processing. After intermittent production, a British company attempted smelting on site in 1898 but the smelter suffered equipment failures and production ceased. (Source: \"Mineral Resources of the United States for 1885\", 1886). No further production from the Lovelock Mine is known for well over a century.\nFor further information about the Lovelock Mine, including scanned copies of certain historical reports produced by the Nevada Bureau of Mines and precursors of the United States Geological Survey, please visit the Company's website at: http://www.nevadasunrise.ca/projects/lovelock-cobalt-mine/\nGeology and Mineralization of the Lovelock Mine\nThe rocks of the Lovelock Mine area include highly-altered sedimentary and volcanic rocks cut by a larger mass of diorite and by aplitic dikes, all of which are highly altered. The altered volcanic rocks lie in a syncline bordered on the west, north and east by the altered sedimentary rocks. Probable faults, inferred from the nature of the contacts, form the boundaries between the sedimentary and volcanic rocks northwest of the Lovelock Mine.\nThe cobalt and nickel minerals of the Lovelock Mine and the nearby Nickel Mine occur in stringers that cut the rock immediately surrounding the diorite. In the case of the Lovelock Mine, the stringers cut a highly-altered greenstone. The minerals recognized are tetrahedrite, erythrite (cobalt bloom), azurite, and green crusts that contain copper and nickel arsenates and sulphates. Other sources reported the principal mineral present is cobaltite. It was postulated by historical observers that there has been post-mineral faulting with downthrow on the west, and that the extension of the productive zone is west of the Lovelock Mine shaft and at greater depth than the historical workings could reach (Source: \"Nickel Deposits in Cottonwood Canyon, Churchill County, Nevada \", H.G.

U.S. gold futures for February delivery were up $4.80 an ounce at $1,296.20.\n\"The weakness in the dollar is playing its part,\" Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets, said. \"We do think that this trend will continue into 2018. We expect the gold price to finish the year above $1,300 mark, and that would send a strong buy signal for traders.\"\nThe dollar held near a one-month low versus a currency basket on Thursday as the latest jobless claims data suggesting a firm labour market was offset by advance trade balance figures that pointed to a widening trade gap in November.\nThat helped drive gains across commodities, with benchmark Brent crude oil futures near their highest since mid 2015, and copper at a four-year peak.\nThe dollar index is down more than 9 percent so far this year, and is on course for its biggest annual loss since 2003.\nA weakening dollar has helped lift gold nearly 5 percent from the near five-month low of $1,235.92 it hit in mid-December. Its rise has picked up further momentum in the last week from positive technical factors, analysts said.\n\"(The rally) has seen gold march up and close at the 100-day moving average in yet another positive technical development,\" currency broker OANDA said in a note.\n\"With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) still at neutral levels, the technical picture suggests there is still potential topside in this rally.\"\nElsewhere, net gold imports to major consumer China via main conduit Hong Kong fell 23.6 percent in November from the previous month, data showed on Thursday.\nAmong other precious metals, silver was 0.7 percent higher at $16.80 an ounce after earlier hitting its highest since late November at $16.82. Holdings of silver exchange-traded funds tracked by Reuters ticked up to their highest since early September, with Thursday's data showing a 62-tonne inflow.\nPlatinum was up 0.9 percent at $925 an ounce. Palladium was down 0.1 percent at $1,059.74 an ounce, having touched its highest since February 2001 at $1,069.50 on Wednesday.\n(Additional reporting by Apeksha Nair and Nallur Sethuraman in Bengaluru; Editing by David Evans and Mark Potter)",

Median estimates forecast that manufacturing activity eased to 58.2, down from 58.7 from the month before.\nEURUSD intra-day analysis\nEURUSD (1.1656): The EURUSD currency pair was seen posting strong gains on the day on Friday. With the strong momentum led breakout, price action is expected to eventually reach the resistance level of 1.1730. A retest of this level which failed to hold as support could keep the gains in check. However, a breakout above 1.1730 could potentially push the euro currency towards testing the minor resistance level of 1.1846 \u2013 1.1824 region. This could potentially establish the 1.1730 level as support forming a new higher corridor for the currency pair in the short term.\nUSDJPY intra-day analysis\nUSDJPY (110.91): The USDJPY currency pair managed to seek out some gains as price action briefly broke past the resistance level of 110.62. Still, the fact that the breakout above level was not triggered by strong price action leaves the risk of a correction in prices. The 4-hour Stochastics remains in the overbought level which also validates this view. In the event of a correction, the USDJPY currency pair could be seen holding the declines onto the rising trend line once again.\nXAUUSD intra-day analysis\nXAUUSD (1251.26): Gold prices were seen posting a rebound after price action was seen consolidating near the lower trend line of the falling price channel. Still, the overall momentum remains weak and biased to the downside. The immediate resistance level near 1263 region is unlikely to be tested in the near term but remains a possibility. For the short term, a temporary bottom has been formed near the 1247 region. As long as prices hold above this level we expect to see gold prices moving in a sideways range.",

This was in response to the latest report from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) which showed speculators added their biggest short bets against the dollar in more than a month to $6.213 billion.\nU.S. Economic Data\nMonday was a light day as far as economic data is concerned. U.S. Factory Orders fell less than expected in October and shipments of core capital goods were much stronger than previously reported, pointing to sustained strength in manufacturing that should buoy the economy.\nAccording to the U.S. Commerce Department, factory orders dipped 0.1 percent amid a drop in demand for both civilian and defense aircraft after an upwardly revised 1.7 percent jump in September.\nEconomists had forecast factory orders falling 0.4 percent in October after a previously reported 1.4 percent increase in the prior month. Core capital goods orders surged 2.3 percent in September.\nGold\nGold prices retreated on Monday, nearing a four-week low reached last week, in reaction to the stronger U.S. Dollar. The catalysts behind the weakness were the approval of the tax overhaul plan and expectations of a Fed rate hike later this month. The return of volatility to the U.S. equity markets helped limit losses.\nCrude Oil\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate and international-benchmark Brent crude oil futures declined on Monday in reaction to the news that U.S. shale drillers added more rigs last week. Additionally, some of the optimism over the extension of the deal to curb production may have worn off especially since many traders believe the news had been fully-priced into the market.\nU.S. Equity Markets\nThe major U.S. equity indexes finished mixed on Monday after the blue chip Dow Jones industrial Average and the benchmark S&P 500 Index hit new record highs. The NASDAQ Composite remained under pressure, led by declines in Facebook, Alphabet and Netflix. Investors appeared to be rotating funds out of tech and into financial stocks on the back of the Senate tax overhaul vote.",

        "full_text": "Price of Gold Fundamental Daily Forecast \u2013 Demand for Risk, Strong Dollar, Rising Yields Pressuring Gold\nGold is under pressure early Thursday with the selling led by increased demand for higher risk assets, a rise in U.S. Treasury yields and a stronger U.S. Dollar.\nAt 0612 GMT, August Comex Gold futures are trading $1265.00, down $9.50 or -0.75%. If the downside momentum continues, we could see a test of the December 12, 2017 main bottom at $1251.90.\nHelping to generate the downside momentum is the mixed-to-better performances in the global equity markets as investors relaxed a little following an elevation in trade tensions between the U.S. and China triggered a sell-off earlier in the week.\nIn Japan, the Nikkei 225 added 0.79 percent, with machinery stocks leading the gains. Stock markets in China were little changed, but Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index edged up by 0.03 percent. The Shanghai Composite was up 0.06 percent. Australian stocks put in a strong performance with the S&P/ASX 200 jumping 1.13 percent.\nIn further proof of a risk-on session, the European markets were expected to open higher Thursday morning.\nGold is also being pressured by higher U.S. Treasury yields. Overnight, 10-year U.S. Treasury notes and 30-year Treasury bonds are trading lower which means yields are up for a second session. On Wednesday, U.S. Treasury yields rose slightly, a sign of diminishing concerns over U.S. trade relations.\nThe U.S. Dollar is also trading higher against a basket of currencies early Thursday.\nForecast\nThe downside momentum in gold is strong and there is no support between the current price and its December low at $1251.90 so we expect to see a test of this level over the short-run. Since gold has lost its luster as a safe haven asset, we don\u2019t expect to see much action to the upside unless it\u2019s fueled by position-squaring or short-covering.\nThe absence of new trade threats from President Donald Trump seems to be enough to calm investor nerves and drive investors out of safe haven assets like T-Notes, the Japanese Yen and gold. Stock traders may be gaining confidence that the U.S. and China will work out their differences. This could prove to be very bearish for gold prices.\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire",

Though lower grade at Candelaria mine will weigh on its gold production in 2018, the company is poised to deliver improved results driven by strong performance in its Oil & Gas portfolio.\nLower Grade at Candelaria to Drag Down 2018 Production\nIn November 2017, Lundin Mining announced an updated mine plan to address localized pit wall instability. While decreased grades were expected in 2018, the impact on gold and silver production was greater than anticipated. Consequently, Franco-Nevada lowered Gold Equivalent Ounces (\u201cGEO\u201d) production to 440,000-470,000 GEOs from mining assets in 2018 from the earlier mining asset guidance of 460,000-490,000 GEOs. Even though production is expected to recover in 2019, the processing of lower grade material at Candelaria is anticipated to continue for the remainder of 2018. The lower guidance is disappointing as the company\u2019s top-line will not benefit in case metal prices rise.\nMomentum in Oil & Gas Portfolio to Aid 2018 Results\nPerformance from Oil & Gas portfolio remains robust with revenues doubling to $68 million in the first three quarters of 2018 from $33 million in the prior-year period. This can be attributed to stronger oil prices and increased production from the newly added U.S. assets. Drill activity is higher and drilling productivity is better than expected. Consequently, Franco-Nevada now expects to generate $75-$85 million in revenues from oil & gas for 2018, higher than the previous expectation of revenues of $65-$75 million.\nCobre Panama: A Catalyst Despite Near-Term Uncertainty\nThe company has so far invested $1 billion for the Cobre Panama project. Over the next two years, Cobre Panama will be ramping up to full production. Cobre Panama is expected to contribute 25% of the company\u2019s NAV and is a key catalyst. Until actual gold and silver starts coming in from the project, it is not clear how well the mine will produce.\nStrategic Relationship with Continental Resources: A Key Catalyst\nIn October 2018, Franco-Nevada contributed $214.8 million to close its previously announced transaction with Continental Resources, Inc. to acquire Oil & Gas mineral rights in the SCOOP and STACK plays of Oklahoma \u2014 two of the most economic and attractive plays in North America. It has also committed, subject to satisfaction of agreed upon development thresholds, to spend up to $300 million over the next three years to acquire additional mineral rights through a newly-formed company. Acquisition of mineral rights is ongoing and Franco-Nevada now anticipates funding additional capital contributions of between $35 million and $55 million in 2018 as part of its $300 million commitment.\nThis represents a new business development opportunity for Franco-Nevada. It gets an acquisition vehicle, which provides the ability to acquire assets at the grassroots level or directly from individual owners. This is a segment of the market previously inaccessible to Franco-Nevada due to a lack of staff or resources to carry out these smaller-scale acquisitions. More importantly, Franco-Nevada benefits from the operator's drill plans, along with their knowledge of local land title and geology.\nLower Metal Prices: A Near-Term Concern\nThe prices of precious metals, particularly gold are a determining factor for profitability for Franco-Nevada. Gold prices have been affected by the trade tussle between the United States and China, interest rate hikes and a stronger dollar lately. Lower prices will weigh on Franco-Nevada\u2019s performance in the near term.\nShares of the company have lost 23% in the past year, compared with the industry\u2019s decline of 22%.\nPoised Well for the Long Term\nFranco-Nevada strives to generate 80% of revenues from precious metals over long-term horizon which includes gold, silver and PGM. With around 85% of revenues earned from precious metals year-to-date, the company has the flexibility to consider diversification opportunities outside of the precious metals\u2019 space and increase exposure to other commodities while maintaining its long-term target.\nFurther, Franco-Nevada appears to be on a promising long-term trajectory thanks to a healthy portfolio of streaming and royalty agreements put in place years ago. With more mines coming online in the next several years, it will benefit from higher levels of precious metals sales as well as higher prices. The company maintains solid growth outlook till 2022, forecasting production in the range of 565,000-595,000 GEOs. Furthermore, Franco-Nevada\u2019s balance sheet remains debt free.\nFranco-Nevada currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nStocks to Consider\nSome better-ranked stocks in the basic materials space are CF Industries Holdings, Inc. CF, The Mosaic Company MOS and KMG Chemicals, Inc. KMG.\nCF Industries has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 6% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company\u2019s shares have gained 27% in the past year. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nMosaic has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 7% and a Zacks Rank #1.

The move most likely reflects a reaction to the weaker U.S. Dollar.\nThe price action suggests gold traders remain on edge and at heightened tension levels because of the fiery rhetoric being spewed by Russian President Vladimir Putin who warned on Sunday that further Western attacks on Syria would bring chaos to world affairs, as Washington prepared to increase pressure on Russia with new economic sanctions.\nIn a telephone conversation with his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani, Putin and Rouhani agreed that the Western strikes had damaged the chances of achieving a political resolution in the seven-year Syria conflict, according to a Kremlin statement.\n\u201cVladimir Putin, in particular, stressed that if such actions committed in violation of the U.N. Charter continue, then it will inevitably lead to chaos in international relations,\u201d the Kremlin statement said.\nThe early price action indicates that we could see two-sided trading throughout the day since both speculators and professional traders are likely to remain active in the markets.\nSpeculators will be betting on a rally and they\u2019ll get their expected move if stocks weaken along with the dollar. This will likely occur if there is an active response to the attack.\nProfessional traders will be watching the events in Syria, but likely to maintain a bearish bias because of rising U.S. interest rates and a strengthening economy. Additionally, a continuation of the nine-session rally in stocks will likely keep the pressure on gold prices. Stocks will be helped by strong earnings reports.",

As it turned out, Franco-Nevada's timing was good, and that helped power a 34% gain for the stock during the course of 2017.\nWith strong prospects ahead, Franco-Nevada has high hopes for 2018 and beyond. Now's a good time to look more closely at how the streaming giant succeeded in 2017, with an eye toward gaining insight into which strategies will produce the best results going forward.\nThe durability of Franco-Nevada's business model\nOne misconception that many people have about the precious metals streaming business is that it's dependent on rising gold and silver prices. Favorable market environments do help boost profits, but in many cases, it's what Franco-Nevada does in periods of challenging markets that define its future success.\nThat phenomenon showed itself throughout the year. Even though precious metals prices oscillated upward and downward, Franco-Nevada's production levels reflected ongoing efforts to bring in lucrative new deals and find ways to exploit them more fully. Properties like the Antamina mine in Peru have been instrumental in helping to accelerate growth recently, and the company has sought ways to invest further in some of its best plays to take maximum advantage of their potential.\nFranco-Nevada also sustained its impressive history of dividend growth. For the 10th consecutive year, the streaming specialist boosted its payout, giving shareholders a 4.5% increase to $0.23 per share quarterly. Given the extent to which the share price has risen lately, Franco-Nevada's dividend yield of just 1.2% isn't all that high. But in an industry that routinely has mining companies paying no dividends at all, Franco-Nevada continued to stand out among investors looking for income from their natural resources holdings.\nStats on Franco-Nevada\n| Revenue, Past 12 Months | $663.1 million |\n| 1-Year Revenue Growth | 15.7% |\n| Net Income, Past 12 Months | $146.7 million |\n| 1-Year Net Income Growth | 54% |\nData source: Franco-Nevada investor relations.\nThe most important thing Franco-Nevada's did in 2017\nYet despite its reputation for gold, silver, and platinum-group metals projects, Franco-Nevada's most noteworthy achievement in 2017 was its continued pursuit of promising royalty agreements in the oil and natural gas industry. In the third quarter, Franco-Nevada added exposure through a royalty interest on an oil-sands project in Alberta, as well as a portfolio of royalty interests covering the promising West Texas formation known as the Delaware Basin. That added to existing assets that included exposure to the Midland Basin in Texas, the STACK play in Oklahoma, and various properties in western Canada.",

For one thing, the company reported record annual consolidated gold production of 550,423 ounces. Breaking more records, it reported an all-time-high consolidated gold revenue of $683.3 million on record sales of 548,281 ounces; furthermore, there was a record $412 million in operating cash flow for the year.\nLater in the year, unexpected good news about the Fekola mine in Mali reinvigorated investors' enthusiasm. Commencing commercial gold production one month ahead of schedule, the Fekola mine exceeded management's expectations for the amount of gold produced. Whereas the original forecast for fiscal 2017 gold production at Fekola was for 45,000 ounces to 55,000 ounces, management announced, in December, the expectation that production would be between 100,000 ounces and 110,000 ounces.\nFranco-Nevada keeps the lights on by providing up-front payments to gold-mining companies; in exchange, it receives the rights to purchase the mined metal at present prices, or to receive a percentage of mineral production from a mine. This leaves Franco-Nevada less susceptible than gold miners to the significant capital costs of sustaining operations at a mine.\nThe company had no blockbuster announcements during the year that helped to drive shares higher. To the delight of shareholders, however, 2017 marked the 10th consecutive year in which Franco-Nevada has increased its dividend. This distinguishes the company from its peers, since many gold-oriented companies offer either nominal dividends or none at all.\nDuring the year, the company also mitigated risk by further diversifying its portfolio. Although gold accounts for about 70% of its revenue, Franco-Nevada is making increasing investments in oil and gas assets. Spending about $300 million in fiscal 2017, the company acquired three royalties related to oil and gas.\nOut of Africa\nLocated in South Africa, Gold Fields Limited operates eight mines in Peru, Ghana, Australia, and South Africa. The company suffered several blows in the first quarter: There were two deaths and several falls of ground (the unexpected and uncontrolled release of debris and rock) at the South Deep mine. The company, consequently, faced restricted access to high-grade areas and haulage infrastructure. But, reporting earnings for the first half of the year, Gold Fields indicated that operations were back on track. Management, moreover, affirmed fiscal 2017 gold production guidance of 315,000 ounces.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nDuring the H1 2017 earnings report, management affirmed other aspects of the company's fiscal 2017 guidance: attributable equivalent gold production of 2.1 million ounces to 2.15 million ounces, and all-in sustaining costs (AISC) between $1,010 per gold ounce and $1,030 per gold ounce.\nInvestors were also encouraged through the second half of the year as Wall Street took kindly to the stock, which received upgrades from analysts at Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank.\nLooking for the yellow stuff in the Great White North\nHighlights for IAMGOLD in 2017 included the development of projects in the company's pipeline. In June, management announced the results of a prefeasibility study for its Cote Gold project in northern Ontario. According to the study, the project has proven and probable gold reserves of 5.9 million ounces, and is estimated to achieve annual gold production of 320,000 ounces over a mine life of 17 years. Further supporting the optimism around the project, Cote Gold is forecast to have AISC of $689 per gold ounce and an after-tax internal rate of return of 14%.\nAddressing other organic growth prospects, IAMGOLD provided a reserve and resource update for the Rosebel mine. Whereas the mine had 2 million ounces of attributable reserves at the end of 2016, it has 3.5 million ounces -- an 80% increase -- as of the end of the third quarter.\nLearning more about Mauritania\nBeating analysts' earnings expectations, Kinross Gold delighted investors in May -- shares climbed 27% in the month -- when it released first-quarter earnings. But the most notable news from the company in 2017 was about its organic-growth projects. In September, Kinross announced its decision to proceed with the Phase Two expansion of its Tasiast mine in Mauritania. Combined with the Phase One expansion, the Phase Two expansion is expected to result in average annual gold production of 812,000 ounces, at AISC of $655 per ounce. Phase One and Phase Two are expected to begin production in Q2 2018 and Q3 2020, respectively.\nIn addition to the Tasiast, Kinross announced its intent to pursue development of the Round Mountain Phase W project in Nevada. Among other things, Phase W includes construction of a new heap leach pad and the relocation of some existing infrastructure. The project is expected to add gold production of 1.5 million ounces over the life of the mine, and has an estimated internal rate of return of 13%.\nGold investors: take care\nSoaring more than 30% through 2017, these five companies -- B2G, Franco-Nevada, Gold Fields, IAMGOLD, and Kinross Gold -- all exceeded the 12% rise in the price of gold in 2017. Besides the increased price of the yellow stuff, a number of other factors benefited their stocks. But even though these stocks gleamed brighter than their peers, investors must exercise extreme caution before considering any positions, since investing in gold is fraught with risk.\nScott Levine has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

It also wants more exposure in Canada.\nRob Krcmarov, executive vice president of exploration, said Barrick is interested in \"copper opportunities\" within its operating regions that meet investment criteria.\nTo approve projects with potential for more than 5 million ounces of gold, Barrick will require a 15-percent rate of return, based on a $1,000 gold price, said Quick. Projects with more than 3 million ounces of gold, need a 20-percent return.\nBarrick expects stronger operating cash flows, non-core asset sales and lower overhead and interest costs will help it increase future dividends, said Randgold Chief Financial Officer Graham Shuttleworth, who takes the same role at Barrick.\nTalks are underway to sell Barrick's Lagunas Norte mine, said Mark Hill, COO of Latin America. Barrick said in August the Peru mine was an example of the non-core mines it would look at selling. Reuters reported last year that Barrick was exploring options, including the sale of all or part of, Lagunas Norte.

Maximum mining rate is 33 Mt per annum. The average ore grade is 1.71 g/t Au and the LOM stripping ratio is 5.8:1.\nFuture Work\nThe FS will be used to support an application for a mining concession to be submitted in the fourth quarter of 2018, with approval expected in the first half of 2019. In the interim, the project team will continue to optimize aspects of the project design and complete an infrastructure condemnation drilling program. The exploration team has worked to consolidate additional exploration concessions near the Boto Gold Project, and will conduct ongoing exploration to expand resources in proximity to the resource pits, and identify and evaluate high priority exploration targets for additional mineral resources.\nQualified Persons\nThe FS was prepared by IAMGOLD and Lycopodium and incorporates the work of IAMGOLD, Lycopodium and Specialist Consultants Qualified Persons (QPs) (as defined under National Instrument 43-101).

These standards differ significantly from the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Mineral Resources which are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.\nThis document contains \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of Canadian securities legislation and \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This information and these statements, referred to herein as \"forward-looking statements\" are made as of the date of this document. Forward-looking statements relate to future events or future performance and reflect current estimates, predictions, expectations or beliefs regarding future events and include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to:\n(i) the estimated amount and grade of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves;\n(ii) the FS representing a viable development option for the Project;\n(iii) estimates of the capital costs of constructing mine facilities and bringing a mine into production, of sustaining capital and the duration of financing payback periods;\n(iv) the estimated amount of future production, both produced and metal recovered; and,\n(v) estimates of operating costs and total costs, net cash flow, net present value and economic returns from an operating mine.\nAny statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions, expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives or future events or performance (often, but not always, using words or phrases such as \"expects\", \"anticipates\", \"plans\", \"projects\", \"estimates\", \"envisages\", \"assumes\", \"intends\", \"strategy\", \"goals\", \"objectives\" or variations thereof or stating that certain actions, events or results \"may\", \"could\", \"would\", \"might\" or \"will\" be taken, occur or be achieved, or the negative of any of these terms and similar expressions) are not statements of historical fact and may be forward-looking statements.\nAll forward-looking statements are based on IAMGOLD's or its consultants' current beliefs as well as various assumptions made by them and information currently available to them. The most significant assumptions are set forth above, but generally these assumptions include:\n(i) the presence of and continuity of metals at the Boto Project at estimated grades;\n(ii) the geotechnical and metallurgical characteristics of rock conforming to sampled results; including the quantities of water and the quality of the water that must be diverted or treated during mining operations;\n(iii) the capacities and durability of various machinery and equipment;\n(iv) the availability of personnel, machinery and equipment at estimated prices and within the estimated delivery times;\n(v) currency exchange rates;\n(vi) metals sales prices and exchange rate assumed;\n(vii) appropriate discount rates applied to the cash flows in the economic analysis;\n(viii) tax rates and royalty rates applicable to the proposed mining operation;\n(ix) the availability of acceptable financing under assumed structure and costs;\n* anticipated mining losses and dilution;\n(xi) metallurgical performance;\n(xii) reasonable contingency requirements;\n(xiii) success in realizing proposed operations;\n(xiv) receipt of permits and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms; and\n(xv) the fulfillment of environmental assessment commitments and arrangements with local communities.\nAlthough management considers these assumptions to be reasonable based on information currently available to it, they may prove to be incorrect. Many forward-looking statements are made assuming the correctness of other forward looking statements, such as statements of net present value and internal rates of return, which are based on most of the other forward-looking statements and assumptions herein. The cost information is also prepared using current values, but the time for incurring the costs will be in the future and it is assumed costs will remain stable over the relevant period.\nBy their very nature, forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties, both general and specific, and risks exist that estimates, forecasts, projections and other forward-looking statements will not be achieved or that assumptions do not reflect future experience. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements as a number of important factors could cause the actual outcomes to differ materially from the beliefs, plans, objectives, expectations, anticipations, estimates assumptions and intentions expressed in such forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be generally stated as the risk that the assumptions and estimates expressed above do not occur as forecast, but specifically include, without limitation: risks relating to variations in the mineral content within the material identified as Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves from that predicted; variations in rates of recovery and extraction; the geotechnical characteristics of the rock mined or through which infrastructure is built differing from that predicted, the quantity of water that will need to be diverted or treated during mining operations being different from what is expected to be encountered during mining operations or post closure, or the rate of flow of the water being different; developments in world metals markets; risks relating to fluctuations in the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar; increases in the estimated capital and operating costs or unanticipated costs; difficulties attracting the necessary work force; increases in financing costs or adverse changes to the terms of available financing, if any; tax rates or royalties being greater than assumed; changes in development or mining plans due to changes in logistical, technical or other factors; changes in project parameters as plans continue to be refined; risks relating to receipt of regulatory approvals; delays in stakeholder negotiations; changes in regulations applying to the development, operation, and closure of mining operations from what currently exists; the effects of competition in the markets in which IAMGOLD operates; operational and infrastructure risks and the additional risks described in IAMGOLD's Annual Information Form filed with SEDAR in Canada (available at www.sedar.com ) for the year ended December 31, 2017 and in the Corporation's Annual Report Form 40-F filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on EDGAR (available at https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html. IAMGOLD cautions that the foregoing list of factors that may affect future results is not exhaustive.\nWhen relying on our forward-looking statements to make decisions with respect to IAMGOLD, investors and others should carefully consider the foregoing factors and other uncertainties and potential events. IAMGOLD does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time by IAMGOLD or on our behalf, except as required by law.\nAbout IAMGOLD\nIAMGOLD (www.iamgold.com) is a mid-tier mining company with four operating gold mines on three continents.

Young\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Gold prices slid on Thursday as investors purchased riskier assets instead of seeking a safe haven in gold, amid hopes for a new round of U.S.-China trade talks.\nSpot gold declined 0.3 percent to $1,202.30 per ounce by 1:34 p.m. EDT (1734 GMT), after earlier hitting its highest level since Aug. 28 at $1,212.49.

Even though the dollar is down, we're not seeing that equate to higher prices in precious metals,\" said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA Bank. \"It just seems like the sentiment for the meals is very negative.\"\nThe dollar index declined against a basket of major currencies after data showed U.S. consumer prices increased less than expected in August, paring traders' outlook that domestic inflation is accelerating. [USD/]\nA weaker dollar typically makes dollar-priced gold less expensive for holders of other currencies, but the correlation broke on Thursday.\nThe CPI data came after soft U.S. wholesale price data undermined the case for a faster pace of policy tightening by the Fed. The U.S. central bank is widely expected to raise benchmark interest rates at its September meeting.\nHigher rates make gold less attractive since it does not pay interest and costs to store and insure.\nIn trade talks, senior U.S. officials sent an invitation to their Chinese counterparts to hold another bilateral trade meeting, raising speculation about a subtle shift in Washington's policy.\nThe months-long trade rift between Washington and Beijing has prompted investors to buy the U.S. dollar in the belief that the United States has less to lose from the dispute. This has driven investors toward record short positions in Comex gold and heavy liquidations in gold exchange-traded funds.

Dau is pleased to provide an update regarding progress recently observed at the Mesco mine site.\nBACKGROUND\nIn 2013 Angkor sold for $1.8 million US in cash a 12 km2 portion of its Oyadao South Exploration Licence, known as Phum Syarung, to Mesco Gold (Cambodia) Co., Ltd (\u201cMesco\u201d).

Environmental approvals were granted to Mesco on August 8, 2016 and a mining license was issued to Mesco by the Cambodian Ministry of Mines on September 6, 2016.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nAngkor staff visited the Phum Syarung mine site last week to observe progress underground and to the infrastructure.\n\u201cMesco was granted Cambodia\u2019s first modern mining license in September 2016 and has since been building out their mining infrastructure,\" said Angkor President J.P. Dau. \u201cLast week, we had the opportunity to visit the site. Multiple administrative buildings have been completed and are occupied on site, as well as an on-site assay lab in full operation with the capability to quickly test not only gold, but also a full suite of other elements - including copper and silver.\u201d\nThe Angkor team also observed progress underground as well. The headframe has been in place since early 2017, along with two inclines and a loading shaft. Incline 1 is now approximately 213.0 m in length and has become the main entrance point for Mesco to stage the next steps of underground development. Horizontal cross-cutting off of incline 1 on multiple levels is planned by Mesco to join the loading shaft and Incline 2. The overall distance between the loading shaft at the northern most point and Incline 2 at the southernmost point is approximately 400m.\n\u201cMesco informs us that it has purchased underground mining equipment which has started to arrive in Cambodia,\u201d said Dau, \u201cwith the first of many containers currently waiting for delivery at customs. This represents a major investment by Mesco and is a very encouraging sign.\u201d\nNET SMELTER RETURN LINKED TO GOLD PRICE\nAngkor\u2019s Net Smelter Return is linked to the price of gold. Under the agreement with Mesco, the NSR is a minimum of 2.0% where the gold price is less than US$1000 and increases by 0.25% for every US$50 that the gold price exceeds US$1000, to a maximum of 7.5%. For all other minerals the NSR is a fixed 7.5%.\n\u201cWe are especially encouraged by the recent progress which comes at a time when Thompson Reuters has predicted the average gold price for 2018 to be $1360/oz,\u201d continued Dau. \u201cWith gold in 2018 at or near its highest annual price for 5 years and our royalty at Mesco on a sliding scale based on the price of gold, so this would be very good news for us,\u201d he said. \u201cAs well, a strong gold price has also generated significant recent interest in our other properties where gold is the primary target.\u201d\nDau also cautioned that \u201cdue to Mesco being owned and operated by Mesco Steels Limited and other entities based in India, their results and reporting as to grade and project economics are not governed by CIM definitions or North American NI 43-101 standards or requirements. They own the project and conduct any and all exploration and testing themselves. Our agreement with Mesco does not give us access to their data, assays, process or project economics for verification.\u201d\nUnder Mesco\u2019s agreement with Angkor, Mesco is not obligated to provide such data for verification until and if any future production commences. Angkor\u2019s only interest in Mesco\u2019s Phum Syraung project is as an NSR holder.\nCAMBODIAN INVESTMENT AND ECONOMY\nCambodia\u2019s economy is predicted to grow this year again at a rate of 7%. As a major member of the ASEAN group of nations and with its \u2018One Belt, One Road\u2019 policy, China has drawn a significant amount of capital investment to Cambodia from foreign markets across numerous sectors. \u201cThe extractive sector in particular has experienced recent success,\u201d said Dau. \u201cKris Energy has been granted a production license marking the first oil to be produced locally, and Angkor\u2019s exploration partner Renaissance is in the final stages of approval for its open-pit gold Okvau mine south of our Koan Nheak property.\u201d\n\u201cIn the 12 years I have lived in Cambodia,\u201d continued Dau, \u201cI have witnessed the country develop at an astronomical pace with no signs of slowing down in the near future. It is not hard to understand why companies such as Manulife and National Bank of Canada have decided to establish their businesses\u2019 presence in Cambodia. As a director of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Cambodia, I have the opportunity to meet the pioneers who are establishing their businesses here in hopes of capitalising on this tremendous opportunity.\u201d\nABOUT ANGKOR GOLD CORP.\nANGKOR Gold Corp. is a public company listed on the TSX-Venture Exchange and is a leading mineral explorer in Cambodia, with a large land package and a first-mover advantage building strong relationships with all levels of government and stakeholders.\nDennis Ouellette, B.Sc, P.Geo., is a member of The Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta (APEGA #104257) and a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101 (\u201cNI 43-101\u201d).

Most of these revolve around what we as investors should expect next. While I don't have a crystal ball (I'd be retired by now if I had a functional one), and am not in any way guaranteeing that the following will come true, here are 18 predictions that I suspect have a decent chance of coming true for the upcoming year.\n1. Bitcoin will lose at least half of its value, twice\nFollowing a blistering run higher, bitcoin's volatility only seems to be growing, not slowing, despite the addition of bitcoin futures trading in December 2017 and the expectation of bitcoin ETFs becoming available in 2018. Since April 2013, bitcoin has plunged by 22% on 20 separate occasions, with three of those instances matching or topping a 50% decline. Given how retail investors (and their emotions) are still in control of bitcoin, wild volatility should be expected. Don't be surprised if bitcoin plunges by 50% or more twice next year.\n2. Russia will ban bitcoin\nVladimir Putin seems to be all but a lock to win a 2018 presidential election in Russia. But this isn't the biggest story you can expect from Russia in the upcoming year. My belief is that Putin will put his foot down on bitcoin and ban the popular cryptocurrency. In October, Putin was quoted as saying bitcoin creates \"opportunities to launder funds acquired through criminal activities, tax evasion, even terrorism financing, as well as the spread of fraud schemes.\" Russia's central bank concurred, too. The list of countries where bitcoin is banned should grow in 2018.\nImage source: Getty Images.\n3. Bitcoin will (briefly) lose its spot at the head of the cryptocurrency table\nUntil recently, bitcoin made up between 60% and 80% of the aggregate market cap of all cryptocurrencies combined. But the fourth quarter saw other virtual coins rally in a big way and handily outperform bitcoin. It's my suspicion that while bitcoin will begin and end the year as the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap, it'll lose that title, at least briefly, in 2018. To what cryptocurrency, you ask? My guess would be either Ripple, which has been snagging blockchain partnerships with big financial institutions, or Ethereum, which has 200 organizations around the world testing a version of its blockchain.\n4. Sears Holdings won't make it through the year without a bankruptcy filing\nTroubled retailer Sears Holdings(NASDAQ: SHLD) has reached into its bag of tricks one too many times and has prevented the inevitable \u2013-- bankruptcy -- for far too long. It's taken loans from its CEO, Eddie Lampert, sold off its well-known Craftsman brand to Stanley Black & Decker, and closed countless Sears and Kmart locations. It's just not working, with organic sales continuing to decline at a rapid pace. 2018 will be the year that Sears seeks the safety of bankruptcy protection.\n5. Apple will fail to reach the $1 trillion mark\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) recently became the first publicly traded company ever to cross the $900 billion market cap mark. But I don't believe it'll be the first to hit $1 trillion, despite being so close. Much of the hoopla surrounding the iPhone 8 and X has already been priced into Apple's stock, which has proven to be historically cyclical based on its development cycle. This doesn't mean we'll necessarily witness a rush to the exit, but Apple will be far from a growth story, in my view, in 2018.\nImage source: Getty Images.\n6. The U.S. stock market will experience its first correction in over two years\nCan you believe it's essentially been two years since the stock market moved lower by at least 10%? My suspicion is that'll change in 2018. Since 1950, the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has had 35 corrections that, when rounded to the nearest whole number, were 10% or greater, according to Yardeni Research. Though the stock market doesn't care about probability, history says we're due.\n7. The U.S. stock markets' annual winning streak will come to a modest end\nThe stock market has been on a relative tear now for nine consecutive years. This writer doesn't believe it'll extend to a 10th year. Long-term buy-and-hold mogul Warren Buffett often suggests that investors \"be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.\" Right now, things look a little too perfect, and there's very little pessimism to be found on Wall Street. That looks to be the perfect recipe for a disappointing year for the broader market, if Buffett's analysis is correct.\n8. Utilities will outperform the S&P 500\nOn the other hand, a flat to modestly down year in stocks often means investors returning to the safety of basic-needs industries. After eating dust for years, my belief is that 2018 will represent a strong year for utility stocks. Their steady cash flow, higher-than-average dividend yields, and share-price stability could be exactly what investors flock to if the stock market or cryptocurrencies undergo a major correction.\nImage source: Getty Images.\n9. The Fed will hike rates three times, despite minimal inflation\nThe big debate is whether the Federal Reserve will increase its federal funds target rate, which influences interest rates, two or three times in 2018. My guess would be three hikes, albeit I still don't see inflation picking up much despite strong Q3 GDP growth figures and the recently passed GOP tax reforms. The Fed is going to continue walking on eggshells and pussyfooting its way to higher interest rates, one quarter-point rate hike at a time.\n10. Gold prices will buck higher interest rates and end the year higher\nHigher interest rates are usually bad news for gold investors since the lustrous yellow metal has no yield. However, it should buck the trend in 2018. Corrections in the cryptocurrency market should send some investors back to gold, while continued pressure on the U.S. dollar tends to be a positive for the gold market. Let's also not forget that gold producers haven't exactly ramped up exploration spending as they did in the early part of the decade. With demand likely to continue outpacing production growth, the fundamentals are in place for a strong year in gold and gold stocks.\n11. The GOP will lose control of the Senate, but maintain control of the House\nPolitics is about as easy to predict as the next number on a roulette wheel. Then again, it's not hard to ignore the disapproval ratings with the GOP's handling of healthcare reform and tax reform from the American public. With just a one-seat majority in the Senate and midterm elections looming in November 2018, it's looking more likely than not that the GOP-controlled Congress will soon become a split Congress.\nImage source: Getty Images.\n12. Healthcare reform will again fail to pass muster in Congress\nGiven the prediction that the GOP will lose seats in the Senate, the chances of healthcare reform passing in the upcoming year is very slim. Republicans couldn't repeal Obamacare and implement a new healthcare plan when they had a two-seat advantage, so it seems even less likely it'll happen with a one-seat advantage for only a portion of the year. Plus, with an infrastructure plan on the horizon, healthcare reform could again take a backseat. In short, Obamacare, or at least its shell now that the individual mandate has been repealed, will live on.\n13. At least three new states will legalize recreational marijuana\nSince 1996, 29 states have legalized medical cannabis, with residents in eight states OK'ing the legalization of recreational pot sales. In 2018, I'd look for at least three, and up to six, states to legalize recreational marijuana. Arizona and Michigan are likely to see voters approve an adult-use weed measure, while New Jersey's Gov.-elect Phil Murphy (D-NJ) has already stated that he'd sign a recreational pot bill put on his desk.\n14. Canadian marijuana stocks will double... again\nSure, cryptocurrencies are all the rage, but among traditional equities, marijuana stocks have been on fire! In particular, Canadian pot stocks can't be stopped of late, primarily based on the expectation that Canada will become the first developed country in the world to legalize adult-use weed by July 2018. With medical cannabis sales steadily increasing and pushing some growers into the black and adult-use demand capable of adding $3.7 billion to $5 billion in annual sales, Canadian marijuana stocks have a real shot to skyrocket even further in 2018.\nImage source: Getty Images.\n15. Brexit goes nowhere\nLooking overseas for a moment, I'd venture a guess that virtually nothing gets resolved in Britain's attempt to break away from the European Union. Though the clock is ticking and the March 2019 date is approaching, the U.K.'s Theresa May and European leaders are nowhere near reaching a consensus on how much Britain should pay to leave the EU, or what the nature of future trade deals with the U.K. will look like. This lack of progress could set the U.K. up for a disappointing year.\n16. Oil will touch $75 per barrel for the first time since 2014\nFollowing a number of really bad years for oil drillers, 2018 is really looking up. West Texas Intermediate recently hit $60 per barrel for the first time since mid-2015, and my suspicion is it'll move as high as $75 per barrel in 2018. Both OPEC and non-OPEC countries have thus far stuck with production cuts, resulting in less oversupply and a higher crude price. Furthermore, the chance of conflict in the Middle East appears to be rising. Any disruption in Middle East oil production would be viewed as a positive for oil prices.\n17. The federal minimum wage will increase for the first time since 2009\nIt's been nine years since the federal minimum wage has been increased by Congress. I believe that'll change in 2018, and $7.25 an hour will be a thing of the past. To begin with, not adjusting the minimum wage higher in nine years has allowed minimum wage workers to be crushed by the impacts of inflation. With the U.S. economy clicking and unemployment exceptionally low, there are ample reasons to support an increased federal minimum wage. Additionally, if Democrats gain hold of one or both houses of Congress, I suspect they'll make a federal minimum wage increase a priority.\nImage source: Getty Images.\n18. Social Security's COLA comes in below 2% for 2019\nLast, but not least, I'd expect Social Security's cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to disappoint once again. The only reason beneficiaries received a 2% raise in 2018 -- the highest raise in six years -- was a result of gasoline-price inflation tied to hurricanes Harvey and Irma. While representing a nice upward tick in benefits, it's also going to create some tough year-over-year comparisons for Social Security's inflationary tether, the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers. Unless the U.S. is hit by another devastating hurricane in the third quarter of 2018 or inflation dramatically picks up, COLA is likely to come in below 2% for 2019.\nSean Williams has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

(ORV.TO) (the \"Company\" or \"Orvana\") announced today financial and operational results for the first quarter (\"Q1 2018\"). The Company is also providing financial and operational updates for its El Valle and Carl\u00e9s Mines (collectively, \"El Valle\") operations in northern Spain and its Don Mario Mine in Bolivia.\nThe unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements for Q1 2018 and Management's Discussion and Analysis related thereto are available on SEDAR and on the Company's website at www.orvana.com.\nQ1 2018 Highlights\nThe Company's strategy to increase production at its El Valle operation targets productivity enhancements to allow for delivery of higher gold ore grades to the mill that are expected to result in higher gold ounces to be produced and reduced unitary costs, while at Don Mario the Company is focusing on nearby gold deposits to extend its mine life. The Company reports the following positive developments in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as follows:\n- El Valle \u2013 Ramp up of oxides production continues:\n- Don Mario \u2013 Consistent performance:\nJuan Gavidia, Interim CEO stated, \"Our Don Mario operation continues to deliver consistently strong results from LMZ ore processed through its carbon-in-leach circuit, and we look forward to maintaining this trend with ore from our nearby Cerro Felix gold deposit shortly. At El Valle, our ramp up of higher gold grade oxide production continues, though on a longer timeframe than initially planned. The challenges that we experienced at El Valle in Q1 are in the process of being resolved. Our updated planning for the balance of fiscal 2018 indicates that a portion of our first quarter shortfall will be recovered over the remainder of the fiscal year, bringing annual production and costs in line with our guidance.\"\nStrategy and Outlook\nThe Company continues to pursue its objectives of optimizing production, lowering unitary cash costs, maximizing fee cash flow, extending the life-of-mine of its operations and growing its operations to deliver shareholder value.\nEl Valle\nAt El Valle, the primary objective in fiscal 2018 continues to be replacing mined skarn tonnes with higher gold grade oxides in order to bring the proportion of oxide ore processed in the plant up to a target of 50%, thereby substantially increasing ore grades delivered to the mill and increasing gold ounce production. Through additional geological and geotechnical work, the Company also expects to significantly increase the reliability of the mine plan by minimizing the proportion of inferred material in its mine planning and taking additional measures to address grade variability. Infrastructure and fleet maintenance investments to improve productivity and efficiency will continue to be made through fiscal 2018 as planned. It is anticipated that these actions will also positively impact El Valle's unitary costs in fiscal 2018.\nDon Mario\nAt Don Mario, the Company continues to produce consistent results from its re-commissioned CIL circuit, producing an average of over 12,000 ounces of gold per quarter from the Lower Mineralized Zone. Don Mario continues to pursue realization of a number of known opportunities for mine life extension. In the near term, the Company expects to commence pre-stripping activities at Cerro Felix in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, and intends to transition its mine production to this satellite deposit following the depletion of the LMZ, expected in mid-fiscal 2018. The Company has also been evaluating opportunities to further extend the life of Don Mario, including processing existing mineral stockpiles, potential mining of the Company's Las Tojas deposit, potential mining of the UMZ bottom pit and reprocessing gold bearing tailings.\nWhile maintaining its focus on optimizing current operations, the Company will also evaluate strategic alternatives that could serve to transform the profile of the Company.\nFY 2018 Production and Cost Guidance\n| Q1 2018 Actual | FY 2018 Guidance | |||||\n| El Valle Production | ||||||\n| Gold (oz) | 10,784 | 65,000 \u2013 72,000 | ||||\n| Copper (million lbs) | 0.9 | 4.1 \u2013 4.5 | ||||\n| Don Mario Production | ||||||\n| Gold (oz) | 12,388 | 45,000 \u2013 48,000 | ||||\n| Copper (million lbs) | 1.9 | 2.0 \u2013 2.3 | ||||\n| Total Production | ||||||\n| Gold (oz) | 23,172 | 110,000 \u2013 120,000 | ||||\n| Copper (million lbs) | 2.8 | 6.1 \u2013 6.8 | ||||\n| Total capital expenditures | $6,207 | $24,000 \u2013 $27,000 | ||||\n| Cash operating costs (by-product) ($/oz) gold (1) | $999 | $950 \u2013 $1,050 | ||||\n| All-in sustaining costs (by-product) ($/oz) gold (1) | $1,253 | $1,150 \u2013 $1,250 |\n| (1) | FY 2018 guidance assumptions for COC and AISC include by-product commodity prices of $2.75 per pound of copper and an average Euro to US Dollar exchange of 1.20. |\nSelected Operational and Financial Information\n| Q1 2018 | Q4 2017 | Q1 2017 | FY 2017 | |||\n| Operating Performance | ||||||\n| Gold | ||||||\n| Production (oz) | 23,172 | 27,666 | 15,699 | 90,292 | ||\n| Sales (oz) | 21,995 | 29,639 | 14,060 | 88,636 | ||\n| Average realized price / oz | $1,269 | $1,268 | $1,260 | $1,258 | ||\n| Copper | ||||||\n| Production ('000 lbs) | 2,759 | 3,601 | 3,588 | 13,893 | ||\n| Sales ('000 lbs) | 2,700 | 3,850 | 3,598 | 14,686 | ||\n| Average realized price / lb | $2.82 | $2.74 | $2.32 | $2.50 | ||\n| Financial Performance (in 000's, except per share amounts) | ||||||\n| Revenue | $34,170 | $46,156 | $23,458 | $137,999 | ||\n| Mining costs | $28,060 | $34,562 | $24,356 | $116,370 | ||\n| Gross margin | $458 | $3,274 | ($6,853) | ($5,480) | ||\n| Net loss | ($3,379) | ($1,722) | ($8,154) | ($15,555) | ||\n| Net loss per share (basic/diluted) | ($0.02) | ($0.01) | ($0.06) | ($0.11) | ||\n| EBITDA (1) | $4,182 | $10,313 | ($3,334) | $16,535 | ||\n| Operating cash flows | $2,147 | $12,328 | ($299) | $20,726 | ||\n| Ending cash and cash equivalents | $20,617 | $23,811 | $9,521 | $23,811 | ||\n| Capital expenditures (2) | $6,207 | $5,818 | $7,719 | $21,332 | ||\n| Cash operating costs (by-product) ($/oz) gold (1) | $999 | $902 | $1,258 | $1,015 | ||\n| All-in sustaining costs (by-product) ($/oz) gold (1)(2) | $1,253 | $1,145 | $1,732 | $1,269 |\n| (1) | Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"), cash operating costs and all-in sustaining costs are non-IFRS performance measures. |\n| (2) | Each reported period excludes capital expenditures incurred in the period which will be paid in subsequent periods and includes capital expenditures incurred in prior periods and paid for in the applicable reporting period.

Gold prices eased and the dollar slipped, lifting the euro to levels last seen in December 2014. European shares, as marked by the pan-regional STOXX 600 index <.STOXX>, fell for a fourth day, led lower by Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk after its operating profit fell short of expectations. \"At currently high valuations for developed market equities, investors should tread cautiously in what remains a top-of-cycle environment, even if rising bond yields are more likely a headwind than a precursor to a crisis,\" said Alastair George, chief strategist at Edison Investment Research. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe <.MIWD00000PUS> slipped 0.08 percent after the close after rising during the regular session. Stocks on Wall Street traded near break-even in a see-saw session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> rose 37.32 points, or 0.14 percent, to 26,186.71.

In Europe, the STOXX 600 closed down 0.5 percent and the pan-regional FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> lost 0.62 percent. Stretched valuations, a long overdue pullback in stocks and uncertainty over a potential shutdown of the U.S. federal government are driving a sense of caution in the market, said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in New York. \"Rising interest rates don't necessary mean a hard stop for equity prices moving higher but they do add a degree of moderation to the enthusiasm,\" Kenny said. The dollar, which fell 3.25 percent in January to mark its weakest monthly performance since March 2016, pared gains against the yen as stocks fell in Europe and treaded water on Wall Street. The dollar has struggled as expected monetary policy tightening elsewhere in the world, along with stronger global economic growth, encouraged investors to go abroad, particularly the euro zone. The dollar index <.DXY> fell 0.56 percent, with the euro up 0.71 percent to $1.2508. The Japanese yen weakened 0.15 percent versus the greenback at 109.35 per dollar. Germany's 10-year government bond yield, the benchmark for the euro zone, hit a more than two-year high of 0.738 percent. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last fell 17/32 in price to yield 2.7840 percent, up from 2.72 percent late on Wednesday. Oil rose after a survey showed the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' commitment to its supply cuts remains in place, even as U.S. production topped 10 million barrels per day for the first time since 1970. U.S. crude rose $1.07 to settle $65.80 per barrel and Brent settled up 76 cents at $69.65. U.S. gold futures futures for April delivery settled up $4.80 at $1,347.90 per ounce.

Taking out $1238.80 last week signal a resumption of the downtrend. This puts the gold market in a position to challenge a pair of main bottoms at $1230.70 and $1228.20.\nThe minor trend is also down. The new minor trend top drops down from $1313.00 to $1266.90. A trade through $1266.90 will change the minor trend to up.\nThe main range is the contract range of $1158.40 to $1379.30. Its retracement zone at $1268.90 to $1242.80 is controlling the longer-term direction of the gold market. The close under the lower or Fib level at $1242.80 is helping to contribute to the downside bias.\nWeekly Technical Forecast\nBased on last week\u2019s close at $1241.80, the direction of the August Comex Gold futures contract is likely to be determined by trader reaction to the Fib level at $1242.80.\nA sustained move under $1242.80 will indicate the presence of sellers. This could drive the market into the pair of bottoms at $1230.70 and $1228.20. If $1228.20 fails then look out to the downside since the next major bottom doesn\u2019t come in until $1158.40.\nA sustained move over $1242.80 will signal the presence of buyers. If this move creates enough upside momentum then look for a potential spike into a steep downtrending Gann angle at $1263.10, followed by the minor top at $1266.90 and the major 50% level at $1268.90. This market will have to clear $1268.90 to turn bullish.\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire",

With inflation finally showing green shoots and President Donald Trump\u2019s $1.5 trillion tax reform law expected to increase deficit spending, this year could provide the right conditions to spur gold prices higher.\nThe risks inherent in the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy tightening is a good place to start.\nBeware the Rate Hike Cycle?\nSince the Fed lifted rates last month, gold has behaved just as it did following the last two December rate hikes\u2013that is, it\u2019s begun to appreciate. On the final trading day of 2017, gold broke above $1,300 an ounce, a psychologically important level, and has since climbed an additional 1 percent. This is the first year since 2013, in fact, that gold has started the year above $1,300.\nWe\u2019ve seen this movie before. In July 2016, the yellow metal peaked close to $1,370 an ounce, a 29 percent surge since the December 2015 rate hike. (If you remember, this represented gold\u2019s best first half of the year since 1974.) And in September 2017, it topped out around $1,360, up close to 18 percent since the December 2016 rate hike.\nSo will we see a \u201cFed rally\u201d in 2018 as well? Obviously nothing is guaranteed, but let\u2019s say gold were to follow a similar trajectory this year as it did in 2016 and 2017. That would put gold somewhere between $1,460 and $1,600 an ounce by summer. These are prices we haven\u2019t seen in four years.\nI think it\u2019s also worth pointing out in the chart above that support looks good for gold. For the past couple of years, it\u2019s steadily posted higher lows.\nBut wait\u2013shouldn\u2019t rate hikes put a damper on gold prices? Gold, as I\u2019ve discussed many times before,has typically thrived in a low-rate environment since it\u2019s a non-yielding asset. What\u2019s really happening here?\nI\u2019ll let Jim Rickards, editor of Strategic Intelligence, field this question. In a recent Daily Reckoning article titled \u201cThe Next Great Bull Market in Gold Has Begun,\u201d Jim explains that the market is looking beyond the rate hike and \u201casking what comes next.\u201d\nAfter all, the December rate hikes in 2015, 2016 and 2017 were all advertised well in advance by the Fed and were fully discounted by the market. This means that the rate hike was a nonevent, because gold was already priced for it.\nGold markets, in other words, could be forecasting slower economic growth as a result of higher borrowing costs. You might not agree with Jim here, and I\u2019m not asking you to. After all, the U.S. economy is humming right now. Consumer spending is up, optimism is high and we have a robust labor market with unemployment at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. Many people expect the Trump tax cuts to prompt multinational corporations to bring home cash that\u2019s been held overseas, lift wages and boost capex spending.\nAt the same time, we can\u2019t ignore the historical implications of past rate hike cycles. I shared with you last month that in the past 100 years, only three such cycles out of at least 18 didn\u2019t end in a recession.The current cycle could turn out to be just as benign, but that would make it a huge exception, not the norm.\nU.S. Yield Curve Flattens to Level Not Seen Since 2007\nThen there\u2019s the flattening yield curve. The yield curve is said to \u201cflatten\u201d when the difference between the two-year Treasury yield and 10-year Treasury yield starts to tighten. As of today, that spread drew up to around 0.496 percentage points, its flattest level since October 2007.\nThis measure is worth watching because it\u2019s often seen as one of the most reliable \u201ccanary in the coal mine\u201d predictors of recession. The past seven U.S. recessions were directly preceded by an inverted yield curve\u2013that is, when short-term yields rose above long-term yields.\nTo be clear, we still have a way to go before the yield spread inverts. But if this observation concerns you\u2013if you believe the business cycle is in fact getting a little long in the tooth\u2013it might make sense to ensure you have a 10 percent weighting in gold bullion and high-quality gold mutual funds and ETFs.\nInflation Could Be a Lot Hotter Than We Realize\nAnother factor that\u2019s driven gold prices in the past is inflation. When the cost of living has eaten away at government bond yields, investors have tended to seek more attractive stores of value, including gold. This is at the heart of gold\u2019s Fear Trade.\nThe problem is that inflation has been sluggish lately\u2013if we\u2019re using the official consumer price index (CPI). In 2017, the CPI just barely met the Fed\u2019s 2 percent target rate. Many economists had expected prices to start creeping up last year in response to President Trump\u2019s nationalist \u201cAmerica first\u201d agenda, complete with new tariffs, strong crackdown on illegal immigration, cancellation of U.S. participation in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). So far these policies haven\u2019t had much effect on inflation.\nBut what\u2019s the \u201creal\u201d inflation? Which gauge should we be looking at? Again, the CPI doesn\u2019t show much movement.\nThe underlying inflation gauge (UIG), however, tells a different story.\nThe UIG, introduced only last year by the New York Fed, is a much broader measure of inflation than the CPI. It includes not just consumer prices but also producer prices, commodity prices and financial asset prices.\nWhen we use this dataset, we find that\u2013surprise!\u2013inflation is not as subdued as we initially thought. Whereas the November CPI came in at 2.2 percent, the UIG heated up to 3 percent, its highest reading since August 2006.\nThe implications here are huge. Three percent is higher than the five-year Treasury yield, currently around 2.3 percent, and the 10-year yield, about 2.5 percent. It\u2019s even higher than the 30-year Treasury yield at 2.8 percent!\nBut there are even more ways to measure inflation, and some show it being higher than the UIG. Economist John Williams runs a website called Shadow Government Statistics, where you can find, among other \u201calternate\u201d datasets, current inflation rates as is they were calculated the way the U.S. government did pre-1980. Note the huge bifurcation between the official CPI and alternate 1980-based CPI. According to the alternate gauge, consumer prices in November rose close to 10 percent year-over-year, or 7.75 percentage points more than the CPI.\n\u201cIn general terms,\u201d Williams writes, \u201cmethodological shifts in government reporting have depressed reported inflation, moving the concept of the CPI away from being a measure of the cost of living needed to maintain a constant standard of living.\u201d\nSo which metric do you believe? The official CPI? The 1980-based CPI? The broader UIG? If it\u2019s one of the last two, you have to ask yourself why you would lock your money up for five years, 10 years or even 30 years in a government bond that fails to keep up with real inflation.

The new resource includes over 50,000m of drilling completed by Rupert up to the end December 2017 along with drilling by the previous owners since the last resource estimate. The drilling has confirmed that the Pahtavaara deposit is demonstrably open at depth and along strike. The modelling work also estimated that 441koz has been mined from Pahtavaara historically (consistent with production data from 1996 to 2014) indicating a yield of over 2,000oz/vertical meter for the Pahtavaara Project.\nJames Withall, Chief Executive of Rupert Resources said \u201cThe resource reported today represents a significant increase from the historical resource and confirms that Pahtavaara is indeed a larger deposit than previously considered with a mineralisation style consistent with other Greenstone belts. Gold mineralisation is believed to continue both along strike and at depth in close proximity to the existing resource.\u201d\nWork in 2018 is focussed on increasing the confidence level of the new resource. A 5,000m underground channel sampling program is underway within the current underground infrastructure to delineate new additional mineralisation with potential to add further to the new resource. Further to this, 42% of almost 320km of diamond drilling remains unsampled at Pahtavaara and a significant amount of this drill core remains at the site. All sampling gaps in diamond drilling have been assumed to have no mineralisation for the purpose of the new resource model so an infill assay program is planned to sample these intersections within the model and additional prospective areas based on the updated geological interpretation.\n| Table 1 - Pahtavaara Project, Inferred Mineral Resource | ||||\n| Cutoff (g/t Au) | Grade (g/t Au) | Tonnage | Au oz | Au kg |\n| 0.5 | 1.6 | 14,540,000 | 756,000 | 23,500 |\n| 1.0 | 2.4 | 7,980,000 | 605,000 | 18,800 |\n| 1.5 | 3.2 | 4,640,000 | 474,000 | 14,700 |\n| 2.0 | 4.0 | 3,030,000 | 385,000 | 12,000 |\n| 3.0 | 5.6 | 1,470,000 | 264,000 | 8,200 |\n| 4.0 | 7.0 | 880,000 | 199,000 | 6,200 |\n| 5.0 | 8.5 | 560,000 | 153,000 | 4,800 |\nThe Mineral Resource estimate for the Pahtavaara Project is reported in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 and has been estimated using the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (\u201cCIM\u201d) \u201cEstimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves best Practice Guidelines\u201d. This mineral resource estimate is classified as Inferred as defined by the CIM. Numbers affected by rounding.

Mr Wolfe confirms that he has reviewed this press release and that the scientific and technical information is consistent with his work.\n- The Qualified Person will prepare and deliver to Rupert a NI 43-101 technical report (the \u201cReport\u201d) in support of this initial resource estimate for the Pahatvaara Project. Rupert will, in accordance with National Instrument 43-101, file the Report on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) within 45 days of this release. The Company will provide notification once the Report has been filed.\n- The effective date of the estimate for the Inferred Resources is 13 April 2018.\n- Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and have not demonstrated economic viability.\n- The QP is not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title-related, taxation, socio-political or marketing issues, or any other relevant issue, that could materially affect the potential development of Mineral Resources.\n- Appendix 2 to this release provides details on the resource estimation approach taken.\nPahtavaara Project, Depleted Mineralisation\nThe study also estimated resources within previously mined areas of the Pahtavaara deposit (see Table 2 and Table 3). For the purposes of the estimated resources occurring within the previously open pits a 0.7g/t cutoff was applied to calculate grade and tonnage above the topographic surface. For the underground stopes and development all blocks occurring within the digitised wireframes were reported without a lower cut off grade. The total approximates to historical production data for the mine, confirming the efficacy of the model.\n| Table 2 - Depleted Mineralisation - Open pit | ||||\n| Cutoff (g/t Au) | Grade (g/t Au) | Tonnage | Au oz | Au kg |\n| 0.5 | 1.9 | 2,870,000 | 178,000 | 5,500 |\n| 0.7 | 2.2 | 2,420,000 | 169,000 | 5,300 |\n| 1.0 | 2.6 | 1,870,000 | 154,000 | 4,800 |\n| Numbers affected by rounding | ||||\n| Table 3 - Depleted Mineralisation \u2013 Underground | ||||\n| Cutoff (g/t Au) | Grade (g/t Au) | Tonnage | Au oz | Au kg |\n| 0.0 | 2.4 | 3,600,000 | 272,000 | 8,500 |\n| Numbers affected by rounding | ||||\nPahtavaara Deposit Geology\nMineralisation at the Pahtavaara Project is hosted by amphibolitised komatiites. The principal geologic control in the area is considered to be a linear structural corridor that trends between east-west and northeast-southwest, with gold mineralisation identified in both the larger structures parallel to this trend. oblique fractures and steeply plunging zones that represent the intersection of these structures or possibly fold hinges. The mineralised structural corridor identified at the Pahtavaara Project is characterised by hydrothermal alteration and mineralisation within komatiiites that have been subjected to several phases of intense, pervasive alteration. The hydrothermal alteration and the Au-bearing structures and veins associated are a result of a prolonged period of ductile deformation and later brittle-ductile deformation related to a belt scale thrusting event. Mineralisation remains open at depth along the entire zone. Gold occurs mostly as free gold with a smaller proportion associated with magnetite.\nAbout Rupert\nRupert is a Canadian based gold exploration and development company that is listed on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol \u201cRUP\u201d.

Vulcan mine planning software package was utilised for interpretation and modelling. The database includes coding of the interpreted mineralisation and drill type. An assessment of an appropriate mineralisation extent using an indicator estimate (0.3g/t Au cutoff) was developed and subsequent grade shells generated. The mineralisation wireframes thus generated were coded to the drillhole database and 2m composites generated and used for the grade estimation. A statistical and geostatistical investigation of the data was undertaken before estimation of Au via multiple indicator kriging (MIK) into an appropriate block model. Localisation of the MIK estimate from parent cell dimension to SMU dimension blocks was then completed along with appropriate validation and checks of the block model.\nThe database, as supplied, was used for resource estimation after a review was completed to subdivide and summarise the various phases and types of drilling. Database statistics are provided below as Table 1. The vast bulk of the data originates from diamond drilling and sludge sampling.\n| Table 1. Summary of the Available Database | ||||\n| DH type | Holes | Metres | % of Total | |\n| Diamond | 2,607 | 319,666 | 62.9% | |\n| RC | 183 | 12,227 | 2.4% | |\n| Sludge (UG) | 9,077 | 175,554 | 34.5% | |\n| Unknown | 8 | 300 | 0.1% | |\n| Channel | 380 | 718 | 0.1% | |\n| Total | 12,255 | 508,465 | 100.0% | |\nFor the purposes of the current resource estimate it has been assumed that the unsampled portions of the drillcore are essentially unmineralized and therefore those absent intervals in the database have been set to 0.001 ppm Au. In the case of all other unsampled data (sludge etc), the unsampled intervals have been ignored as it is less certain why the intervals remained unsampled.\nThe drillhole database contains different data types. Raw sample type statistics are presented in Table 2 below.\n| Table 2. Summary Database Statistics based on sample gold grades | ||||||\n| Sample type | All data | >0.2g/t Au | ||||\n| Number | Mean | % | Number | Mean | % | |\n| Channel | 321 | 3.95 | 0 | 141 | 8.94 | 0 |\n| Dia unknown | 152,302 | 0.48 | 53 | 31,750 | 2.18 | 42 |\n| Dia \u00bd core | 24,927 | 0.22 | 9 | 1,764 | 2.71 | 2 |\n| RC | 16,606 | 0.5 | 6 | 4,155 | 1.82 | 5 |\n| Sludge | 95,171 | 0.99 | 33 | 37,681 | 2.43 | 50 |\n| Unknown | 201 | 0.3 | 0 | 67 | 0.78 | 0 |\n| Total | 289,527 | 0.63 | 100 | 75,738 | 2.31 | 100 |\nThe main dataset is composed of diamond and sludge drilling. Above 0.2g/t Au, 50% of the data is sludge drilling. Grades <0.2g/t Au have been filtered on the basis of the diamond core having long intercepts outside the mineralisation and sludge sampling being mostly within thte mineralisation. Inclusion of the diamond assays <0.2g/t Au therefore skews the average diamond gold grade lower. A log probability plot of the different data types is presented below. Virtually identical distributions can be observed for sludge (light blue), diamond (red and dark blue) and additionally RC samples (pink).\nTo view Figure 3. Log probability plot different sampling types, please visit the following link: http://resource.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/10e89925-f135-4b54-ae8b-02f97a5be27a\nAs the above demonstrates equivalency of global data distribution only, additional tests have been carried out to determine if different sample types co-located within discrete 3D volumes demonstrate equivalency of gold grades. These tests have been undertaken in Isatis geostatistical software. The generalised approach is as follows:\n- Create a grid of blocks with dimensions of 5mE x 5mN x 5mRL (125m3) and 10mE x 10mN x 10mRL (1,000m3)\n- Record statistics for each data type enclosed within each individual block to that block i.e. number, minimum, maximum, mean, etc.\n- In this way the different type of samples contained within each block may be compared. Filters may be applied so that any given block enclosing too few samples of any type will be excluded from the overall comparison.\nStatistics for both grid dimensions have been calculated and results compared. Only blocks where both types of samples are co-located have been considered. Results are presented in Table 3 below. Results indicate equivalency of diamond and sludge sample gold grades when both occur in close proximity. It can be concluded that both types of data can be combined for the purposes of resource estimation.\n| Table 3. Equivalency of diamond and sludge samples | ||||||\n| Sample type | 5mE x 5mN x 5mRL (125m3) | 10mE x 10mN x 10mRL (1,000m3) | ||||\n| Number blocks | Average grade | Total samples | Number blocks | Average grade | Total samples | |\n| Diamond | 804 | 2.9 | 1,327 | 949 | 2.08 | 4,043 |\n| Sludge | 804 | 3.1 | 1,769 | 949 | 2.20 | 8,987 |\nQA/QC\nRupert has followed an extensive and robust suite of protocols to manage and document data acquisition and quality control (QAQC). Rupert have utilised two separate laboratories for gold analysis. The first, CRS laboratories of Kempele, Finland used the PAL 1000 assay method (crush, cyanide leach and AA finish). After 5 months, primary lab was changed to ALS Chemex with a prep lab in Sodankyl\u00e4 and Au assays completed via Leachwell process in Pitea, Sweden.\nIn summary, Rupert have routinely completed the following:\n- Routine production of field duplicates by producing two quarter core samples from a standard half core sample interval.\n- Routine submission of crush duplicates taken after crushing and splitting.\n- Pulverised duplicates taken after the pulverisation stage taken from the same bowl.\n- Routine submission of blanks (commercial available quartz crush from Nilsi\u00e4n kvartsi).\n- Routine insertion of independently prepared and verified certified reference material (CRM) or standards.\nApproximately five percent (5%) of the pulps and rejects are sent for check assaying at a second lab with the results averaged and intersections updated when received. Core recovery in the mineralized zones has averaged 99%.\nWhile the CRM\u2019s initially submitted to the laboratories generally underperformed, this has been attributed to the small size (100g) of the individual CRM\u2019s submitted in comparison to the drill samples submitted (1kg to 2kg). Larger, 500g CRMs more in line with the general sample size were then sourced and these CRM\u2019s have since performed satisfactorily.\nDuplicate sample submission (pulps) indicates satisfactory laboratory precision and approximate equivalency of the duplicate samples. Precision and equivalency for the core (field) and crush duplicates is less well established, however this is down to the variability of the mineralisation and the relatively small size of the dataset once lower grade filters are applied and is an expected result.\nUmpire laboratory check sampling (coarse rejects from initial laboratory) demonstrates moderate levels of accuracy and precision between the sample pairs.\nMineralisation Constraints\nTo establish appropriate grade continuity, the mineralisation envelope was based upon a nominal 0.3ppm Au indicator mineralisation shell estimated using 3m unconstrained downhole composites. This interpretation is designed to capture the broad mineralisation halo that encompasses the geological vein system and is not intended to constrain individual veins or vein clusters. As the main grade estimation technique is MIK with change of support technique, this type of mineralisation constraint is deemed appropriate.\nThe mineralisation grade shell was generated by grade shell via indicator kriging at a single cut-off, 0.3 g/t Au. Grade estimation was undertaken into a block model with cell dimensions of 5m E \u00d7 5 N \u00d7 5 m RL. Grade shell triangulations were then generated by constraining the block model at 20% and 35% probability cut-offs to approximate the mineralisation continuity and also to capture some low to medium grade material as a dilution skin to the higher grade mineralisation. The selected probability shells are considered optimal to capture the observed continuity and tenor of mineralisation while excluding obvious low grade material. Mineralisation estimation domains were thus defined with further sub-division being differentiated on the basis of orientation, flexures in the structures and tenor of gold grade. A total of fourteen estimation domains have been defined with three relating to flat-lying zones located in the central part of the deposit.\nThe constraining wireframe models were then coded to the drillhole database and also used in the construction of the estimation block model. The mineralisation grade shell wireframes have been flagged to the drillhole database and 2m run length composites generated. Statistical and geostatistical investigations were then undertaken on the coded composite database. Flagging was based on the sample interval centroid either being inside or outside of the wireframe and compositing was terminated at the wireframe boundary. The domain grade shell has been divided into fourteen separate sub-domains with similar grade characteristics and orientations. The higher grade core to the mineralisation has been given a separate coding system (with 35 as prefix) compared to the lower grade halo (which has a prefix of 20).\nBased on a statistical review, high-grade cuts were determined for the high grade domains (35 prefix). Top-cut composite statistics are detailed in Table 4. In all instances where top-cutting was applied, the cuts are light to moderate, however domains with extreme high-grade data are typically much more strongly affected.\n| Table 4.

Indicator Kriging cutoffs or indicator bins were selected for each of the estimation groups for estimation by MIK. Cutoffs were based upon population distributions and metal proportions above and below the mean composite value of the proposed cutoff bins. Full details of the variography used will be disclosed in the NI 43-101 release.\nVariography\nA variographic analysis was completed on the coded composite data for the resource estimate study. Composite data from the combined domains has been utilised for variographic analysis. The variograms are presented in the direction of optimal continuity, as determined from fan variography calculated in the cartesian planes. Gaussian semi-variograms were calculated and modelled to determine the appropriate directions of spatial continuity. In general, one representative domain within each group was selected and experimental variography calculated and modelled. Appropriate directional orientations were then applied to the other domains in the group. The gaussian semi-variograms were then back transformed into raw space and the back-transformed variograms were used as input to the support correction calculations. Full details of the variography used will be disclosed in the NI 43-101 release.\nBlock Model\nThe grade estimation was completed into a sub-blocked block model with a 20mE x 10mN x 10mRL parent cell size, sub-blocked to 5mE x 2.5mN x 2.5mRL. No rotation has been applied. Block model variables were added to enable MIK estimates of all variables of interest including auxiliary variables and density. Service variables were also added to record various estimation parameters to review the quality of the estimates. Mining has been undertaken both from open pit operations and underground. Underground workings and open pits have been coded to the block model and the model has been depleted using these via insertion of a block model \u2018flag\u2019.\nGrade Estimation\nMultiple Indicator Kriging (MIK) was applied to grade estimation at Pahtavaara within the defined 0.3g/t Au 35% probability indicator mineralisation shells. The lower grade halo to this, as defined by the 20% probability indicator shells, was estimated via ordinary kriging (OK). A kriging plan was devised which utilised hard boundaries throughout.\nA series of tests were undertaken in Isatis geostatistical software to optimise the kriging neighbourhood parameters to ensure the best quality of estimate. Three estimation passes were made for each domain where necessary, with the sample search criteria relaxed for each successive pass not estimated by the previous estimates and reducing the minimum number of input composites. The OK estimate was undertaken on the basis of one estimation pass. The estimation parameters are summarised in Table 5 and 6. Search ellipsoid orientations were determined for each of the 14 sub-domains. Note that search radii have been locally varied dependent on Domain and the information summarized in Tables 5 and 6 are typical parameters. Note also that the MIK grade estimates were generally more than 90% completed in the first two estimation passes and the third pass represents a negligible volume compared to the total.\n| Table 5. Estimation Parameters MIK | ||||||\n| Estimation Pass | Sample Search | Disc (X x Y x Z) | ||||\n| Orientation (X Y\u2019 Z\u2019\u2019) | Search Radii (X Y\u2019 Z\u2019\u2019) | Min | Max | Max Data per Hole | ||\n| 1 | Variable per domain | 40m x 40m x 20 | 24 | 72 | 16 | 3 x 3 x 2 |\n| 2 | 80m x 80m x 40 | 18 | 72 | - | 3 x 3 x 2 | |\n| 3 | 240m x 240m x 120m | 12 | 72 | - | 3 x 3 x 2 | |\n| Table 6.

Validation of the CCDF of the estimated blocks versus the input composites indicates a good correlation between the two with an example of the Medium Grade Group displayed below.\nTo view Figure 4. CCDF Validation Curves Medium Grade Group, please visit the following link: http://resource.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/198f9951-dff9-41a2-99e8-83f964f14a20\nChange of Support\nApplying the modelled variography, variance adjustment factors were calculated to emulate a 5mE x 2.5mN x 2.5mRL selective mining unit (\u201cSMU\u201d) via the indirect lognormal change of support. The intra-class composite mean grades were used in calculating the whole block and SMU grades. The change of support study also included the calculation of the theoretical global change of support via the discrete Gaussian change of support model. Information effect factors were modelled and a variance adjustment ratio of 0.1 was applied.\nGrade Localisation\nMIK grade estimates are generated in large blocks or panels and are inherently not intuitive to review. Post processing of these MIK estimates aims to simplify the presentation by producing a single SMU dimension block grade where the distribution of the grades in the panel matches that of the distribution in the SMU\u2019s. The MIK panel grades have been localised to SMU dimension blocks in Isatis geostatistical software. Validation of the results indicates a near identical distribution and the resultant model has been accepted. A typical section is presented below.\nTo view Figure 5. Typical sectional view displaying localised Au grades, please visit the following link: http://resource.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/c09123bd-7046-491d-8f59-ba246dde91ce\nValidation of Localised Au Grades\nValidation of localised block Au grades has been undertaken on a per domain basis by comparing the block mean grades with the relevant composite mean grades\nValidation of the localised au grades has shown that a reasonable correlation between both declustered and non declustered composites and block model grades.\nResource Reporting\nThe grade estimate was classified in accordance with the current CIM guidelines as an Inferred Mineral Resource. The Inferred Mineral Resource reported is summarised below as Table 7.\n| Table 7.

They are placing small orders,\" said a Mumbai-based dealer with a private bullion importing bank, adding \"falling rupee is still confusing some.\"\nIndian rupee hit a record low on Thursday, limiting the drop in local gold prices.\nGold imports into India, the world's second biggest buyer of the metal, could drop by 18 percent in 2018 from a year ago, according to a Reuters poll.\nSpot gold hit a more than six-month low this week at $1,250.98 per ounce, as demand for remained weak and as the dollar strengthened to near one-year highs.\nIn top consumer China, premiums were in a range of $2-$4 an ounce against the international benchmark, versus $5-$6 last week.\n\"The Chinese prices have been better than the international prices due to the yuan exchange rate ... Some are eager to buy low, but still waiting,\" GFMS analyst Samson Li said.\nChina's yuan hit a 7-1/2-month low of 6.6522 on Friday.\nPremiums of 80 to 90 cents were charged in Singapore, little changed from the 80 cents-$1 range last week.\nDemand has been quite good in Singapore because prices are at their lowest this year, said Brian Lan, managing director at dealer GoldSilver Central in Singapore.\n\"Right now people who are buying gold are businesses. Some investors are waiting for prices to fall lower before they enter the market.\"\nPremiums in Hong Kong were unchanged from the previous week at 50 cents to $1.20.\nIn Japan, gold was being sold at a premium of 50 cents over benchmark spot, a 25 cent rise from the previous week, as bargain hunting increased demand for the metal.\n($1 = 68.4500 Indian rupees)\n(Additional reporting by Nallur Sethuraman in Bengaluru; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier)",

The 10-year note was up roughly 4 basis points at 2.837 percent, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury bonds was up roughly 5 basis points at 3.08 percent.\nU.S. Federal Reserve News\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve ended its two-day meeting on Wednesday by announcing it would not raise its benchmark interest rate. However, it indicated that it expects inflation pressures to heat up as the year moves on.\nThe decision by the Federal Open Market Committee to leave interest rates at 1.25 to 1.50 percent was widely expected. Additionally, according to projections released in December, FOMC officials expect three rate hikes this year so long as there is no significant disruption to market conditions. Recent price action in the Treasury markets, however, suggests that investors believe the Fed is considering a fourth rate hike.\nU.S. Non-Farm Payrolls Report\nThe U.S. Labor Department reported Friday that the U.S. economy added 200,000 jobs in January, beating economist expectations of 180,000 jobs added. The unemployment rate came in as expected at 4.1%, unchanged from the previous month.\nIn addition to the robust headline news, yields were driven higher by strong evidence of rising wages. Average hourly earnings posted a 0.3 percent gain for the month and an annualized gain of 2.9 percent, the best gain since the early days of the recovery in 2009.\nForecast\nThe direction of the April Comex Gold market this week will be determined by trader reaction to U.S. Treasury yields. Look for gold prices to weaken if Treasury yields continue to rise since this could increase demand for the U.S. Dollar while leading to lower demand for dollar-denominated gold.\nGains could be limited if there is a steep sell-off in the equity indexes because here may be a certain point where investors move money into safe haven assets like gold and the Japanese Yen.\nIn the U.S., the major report is Monday\u2019s ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI. It is expected to come in at 56.5, up from 55.9.\nFed speakers could cause volatile reactions in the market if they give their assessment on the strength of the economy, the direction of inflation and the likelihood of further rate hikes. The key Fed speakers this week will be FOMC Member William Dudley on Wednesday at 1330 GMT and FOMC Member John Williams at 2220 GMT.",

The corresponding weakness in the U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback\u2019s strength against a trade-weighted basket of six major currencies, has helped support gold prices as the precious metal becomes more affordable to holders of foreign currencies.\nIn other metals trading, silver futures gained 1.1% at $16.875 a troy ounce by 10:29AM ET (14:29GMT).\nPalladium futures rose 0.3% to $1,017.70 an ounce, while sister metal platinum lost 0.4% at $904.00.\nIn base metals, copper traded up 1.4% to $3.307 a pound.\nRelated Articles\nExclusive: Trump requested Saudi oil support before Iran nuclear decision - sources",

But a wind-up in hawkish Federal Reserve language after the recent rate hike bolstered the prospects for the dollar again, allowing it to gain at gold\u2019s expense.\nA weaker dollar can make dollar-denominated assets, like gold, less expensive to potential buyers holding other currencies.

Cost of sales applicable to gold3 of $794 per ounce declined slightly compared to 2016, while all-in sustaining costs4 rose by approximately three percent to $750 per ounce, reflecting a planned increase in minesite sustaining capital expenditures. Gold cash costs4 fell by 3.7 percent, driven by a favorable sales mix, and the ongoing impact of initiatives to improve the productivity and efficiency of our operations. Lower free cash flow compared to 2016 was primarily the result of lower production and higher working capital, in part due to the temporary suspension of operations at our Veladero mine in Argentina, and the concentrate export ban impacting Acacia Mining plc\u2019s operations in Tanzania. Higher capital expenditures in 2017 also reflected planned investments in our organic project pipeline, as we invest more in the future of our business.\nIn 2017, we reduced our total debt by $1.51 billion, or 19 percent, exceeding our target of $1.45 billion. We maintained our focus on capital discipline, with total capital expenditures of $1.36 billion, near the low end of our guidance range for the year. We are advancing a pipeline of high-confidence, organic projects with the potential to contribute more than one million ounces of annual production to Barrick, at costs well below our current portfolio average. At the same time, we returned more capital to shareholders, with a 50 percent increase in our quarterly dividend, to $0.03 per share. Finally, we forged a new strategic partnership with Shandong Gold at the Veladero mine, a landmark agreement with the potential to create significant long-term value for our owners, as well as our community and government partners in Argentina and beyond.\nSTRATEGIC FRAMEWORK\nOver the past three years, we have optimized our portfolio by divesting high-cost, non-core operations. We used the proceeds of these divestments to reduce our total debt by more than 50 percent, from $13.1 billion at the end of 2014, to $6.4 billion today. Our portfolio is now focused on high-margin, long-life gold operations and projects clustered in core districts throughout the Americas, with a materially stronger balance sheet.\nOur overriding objective remains unchanged. We are focused on growing free cash flow per share over the long term, which we will do primarily in three ways. First, we will drive industry-leading margins through operational excellence and consistent execution. Second, we will manage our portfolio and allocate capital with discipline and rigor. Third, we will leverage top talent and our distinctive partnership culture as competitive advantages.\nOur priorities for 2018 are consistent. We will maintain our focus on maximizing free cash flow, and seek to build a business that can generate positive free cash flow at a gold price of $1,000 per ounce, on a sustainable basis. We will drive operational excellence through a continuous cycle of optimization, pushing our mines to achieve greater levels of efficiency and productivity, while working to mitigate increasing costs associated with more complex ore types and a shift to more underground mining. This will be aided by investments in digital technology and innovation, which will allow us to identify and accelerate further operational improvements across our portfolio. We will maintain a sharp focus on capital discipline while further strengthening the balance sheet. We will continue to optimize and advance our organic project pipeline. And finally, we will focus on attracting top talent to Barrick and developing our people to achieve their full potential in the Company\u2019s decentralized operating model.\nOUTLOOK\nAll investment decisions are driven by our primary objective of growing free cash flow over the long term, not ounces. Our production profile will adjust up or down according to what best advances this objective. All projects undergo rigorous scrutiny by our Investment Committee at every stage of evaluation and development. Each project is benchmarked against a 15 percent hurdle rate using a long-term gold price of $1,200 per ounce, and ranked accordingly.\nIn 2018, we expect to produce 4.5-5.0 million ounces of gold, at a cost of sales applicable to gold3 of $810-$850 per ounce, and all-in sustaining costs4 of $765-$815 per ounce. Higher cost guidance for 2018 primarily reflects lower anticipated gold production from Barrick Nevada, Pueblo Viejo and Veladero, increased processing of higher-cost inventory, and higher costs at Acacia. We expect first quarter production of around one million ounces at costs that will be proportionately higher than those anticipated for the remainder of the year, largely due to lower grades at Barrick Nevada, and the timing of planned maintenance at Pueblo Viejo.\nTotal attributable capital expenditures for 2018 are expected to be in the range of $1.40-$1.60 billion. This includes project capital expenditures of $450-$550 million, an increase of roughly $270 million compared to 2017, as we increase investments in the future of our business. Attributable mine site sustaining capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $950 million-$1.1 billion, compared to $1.1 billion in 2017, reflecting our ongoing focus on capital efficiency and discipline.\nIn 2018, we expect corporate administration costs to be approximately $275 million, an increase of roughly $75 million compared to 2017. This reflects additional investments to optimize our enterprise-wide processes and systems, to accelerate the implementation of digital technologies across our business, and to drive step-change innovations, all of which are designed to reduce operating costs and increase productivity across the business over the long term.\nBased on our current asset mix, from 2019 to 2022 we expect average annual gold production to be between 4.2-4.6 million ounces, at an average cost of sales3 of $850-$980 per ounce, and average all-in sustaining costs4 of $750-$875 per ounce, representing a stable base case for our business. This includes contributions from feasibility level projects at Goldrush, Cortez Deep South, Turquoise Ridge, and Lagunas Norte\u2014but assumes no contribution from Pascua-Lama, Donlin Gold, Cerro Casale, or Alturas. Please join us for our Investor Day webcast on February 22 for additional insights on our production profile.\nOur aspiration is to have the most efficient and productive gold mines in the industry, and as such, we have challenged ourselves to continually improve our cost profile. It is equally important that we reinvest in the future of our business now, to ensure that we generate sustainable value for our owners over the long term, at the lowest possible costs. In support of this, we are increasing our investments in organic projects and mine exploration drilling, which will strengthen the overall quality of our portfolio. We also are investing in digital systems and innovation, which we expect will drive down costs and improve productivity over the long term.\nPlease see Appendix 1 for detailed operating and capital expenditure guidance. The table found in Appendix 2 outlines the material assumptions used to develop the forward-looking statements in our outlook and guidance, and provides an economic sensitivity analysis of those assumptions. For certain related risk factors, please see the cautionary statement on forward-looking information at the end of this press release.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nFull year net earnings were $1.44 billion ($1.23 per share), compared to net earnings of $655 million ($0.56 per share) in 2016. This significant improvement in net earnings was primarily due to $2.03 billion ($1.43 billion net of tax and non-controlling interest) in impairment reversals and gains on sale related to the divestment of 50 percent of the Veladero mine and 25 percent of the Cerro Casale project in 2017. This was partially offset by net impairment charges of $908 million ($511 million net of tax and non-controlling interest) mainly relating to Acacia\u2019s Bulyanhulu mine, which has been placed on reduced operations, and the Pascua-Lama project, where proven and probable gold reserves have been reclassified as measured and indicated resources, coupled with an impairment reversal at the Lumwana mine.\nIn 2017, adjusted net earnings1 increased by seven percent to $876 million ($0.75 per share), compared to $818 million ($0.70 per share) in 2016. Adjusted net earnings benefited from higher gold and copper prices, combined with lower direct mining costs, reflecting higher capitalized waste stripping at Barrick Nevada and Veladero, a lower relative sales contribution from higher cost operations at Acacia, and lower inventory write-downs compared to 2016. These gains were partially offset by lower sales volumes, primarily due to the sale of 50 percent of Veladero, and the concentrate export ban impacting Acacia\u2019s operations, combined with an increase in exploration and evaluation costs, investments in innovation, higher income tax expense, and higher depreciation expense.\nPlease refer to page 70 of our fourth quarter MD&A for a full list of reconciling items between net earnings and adjusted net earnings for the current and prior year.\nOperating cash flow in 2017 was $2.07 billion, compared to $2.64 billion in 2016. This decrease reflects working capital outflows related to the buildup of inventory at Pueblo Viejo, Lagunas Norte, and Acacia, lower gold sales driven by the sale of 50 percent of the Veladero mine on June 30, 2017, and lower sales volumes at Pueblo Viejo, Hemlo, Turquoise Ridge, Lagunas Norte, and Acacia. Operating cash flow was also impacted by an increase in exploration, evaluation and project expenses, lower operating cash flows attributed to non-controlling interest, and higher cash taxes paid. These declines were partially offset by higher sales from Barrick Nevada, which benefited from operational efficiencies and improved throughput, higher gold and copper prices, and lower direct mining costs (as described above).\nFree cash flow2 for 2017 was $669 million, compared to $1.51 billion in the prior year. The decrease primarily reflects lower operating cash flows combined with higher capital expenditures. In 2017, capital expenditures on a cash basis were $1.40 billion compared to $1.13 billion in 2016. Higher capital spending reflects a $161 million increase in minesite sustaining capital expenditures, primarily at Barrick Nevada and Veladero, partially offset by a decrease in sustaining capital at Acacia. Project capital expenditures also increased by $109 million, reflecting the development of Crossroads and the Cortez Hills Lower Zone at Barrick Nevada, and Goldrush project drilling, partially offset by a decrease in pre-production stripping at the South Arturo pit, which entered commercial production in August 2016.\nRESTORING A STRONG BALANCE SHEET\nAchieving and maintaining a strong balance sheet remains a top priority. In 2017, we reduced our total debt by $1.51 billion, or 19 percent, exceeding our original target of $1.45 billion.\nOur goal remains to reduce our total debt from $6.4 billion at present, to around $5 billion by the end of 2018. We plan to achieve this primarily by using cash flow from operations and cash on hand, and potentially through further portfolio optimization. Barrick will continue to pursue debt reduction with discipline, taking only those actions that make sense for the business, on terms we consider favorable to our shareholders.\nAt the end of the fourth quarter, Barrick had a consolidated cash balance of approximately $2.2 billion.7 The Company has less than $100 million in debt due before 2020.8 More than three-quarters of our outstanding total debt of $6.4 billion does not mature until after 2032.\nOPERATING HIGHLIGHTS\nIn 2017, our operations produced 5.32 million ounces of gold, at a cost of sales3 of $794 per ounce, and all-in sustaining costs4 of $750 per ounce, with a particularly strong performance from Barrick Nevada. This compares to production of 5.52 million ounces of gold in 2016, at a cost of sales3 of $798 per ounce, and all-in sustaining costs4 of $730 per ounce. Lower production in 2017 primarily reflects the sale of 50 percent of the Veladero mine on June 30, and lower production from Acacia as a result of Tanzania\u2019s concentrate export ban.\nOur most important operational priorities are to ensure the safety of people and the environment. We improved our safety performance in 2017, achieving a total reportable injury frequency rate (TRIFR)9 of 0.35\u2014the best result in the Company\u2019s history, and among the lowest in the industry. Regrettably, this was overshadowed by the tragic deaths of two team members in workplace accidents in 2017: Williams Garrido, a contractor at the Pascua-Lama project; and Eulogio Gutierrez, an employee at our Hemlo mine. We will not be satisfied with our performance until we can say that every person at Barrick has gone home safe and healthy every day, and this will remain our focus in 2018.\nConsistent with our overall improvement trend in safety, we also achieved a 38 percent reduction in reportable environmental incidents at our operations last year, from 13 incidents in 2016, to eight incidents in 2017. Despite this success, a pipe rupture at the leach pad of our Veladero operation in March 2017 resulted in a three-and-a-half month suspension of processing operations at the mine. In response, Veladero implemented a series of measures to strengthen the mine\u2019s operating systems, including major modifications to the heap leach facility, as well as initiatives to improve community engagement, training, and local hiring.\nOn a per ounce basis, cost of sales applicable to gold3 declined slightly compared to 2016. All-in sustaining costs4 increased by three percent, primarily reflecting an increase in minesite sustaining capital expenditures. At the same time, we reduced our cash costs4 by 3.7 percent, from $546 per ounce in 2016, to $526 per ounce in 2017, reflecting a favorable sales mix, as well as our ongoing focus on driving Best-in-Class productivity and efficiency improvements across our portfolio.\nGold production in the fourth quarter was 1.34 million ounces, at a cost of sales applicable to gold3 of $801 per ounce, and all-in sustaining costs4 of $756 per ounce, compared to 1.52 million ounces, at a cost of sales3 of $784 per ounce, and all-in sustaining costs4 of $732 per ounce in the prior-year period.\nIn 2017, our copper portfolio produced 413 million pounds, at a cost of sales3 of $1.77 per pound, and all-in sustaining costs6 of $2.34 per pound. Production was slightly below the Company\u2019s adjusted guidance of 420-440 million pounds for 2017, but in line with our original full year guidance of 400-450 million pounds. This compares to production of 415 million pounds, at a cost of sales3 of $1.41 per pound, and all-in sustaining costs6 of $2.05 per pound in 2016.\nCopper production in the fourth quarter was 99 million pounds, at a cost of sales3 of $1.79 per pound, and all-in sustaining costs6 of $2.51 per pound, compared to 101 million pounds, at a cost of sales3 of $1.43 per pound, and all-in sustaining costs6 of $2.04 per pound in the prior-year period.\nCost of sales applicable to copper3 increased by 25 percent in 2017 as a result of higher power, fuel, consumables and contractor costs, combined with higher depreciation expense at Lumwana. Copper all-in sustaining costs6, which have been adjusted to include our proportionate share of equity method investments, were 14 percent higher than the prior year, primarily as a result of higher cost of sales and higher minesite sustaining capital expenditures at Lumwana and Jabal Sayid.\nTurquoise Ridge Toll Milling Agreement\nIn January 2018, Barrick and Newmont Mining Corporation (\u201cNewmont\u201d) reached a new, seven-year toll milling agreement for the processing of Turquoise Ridge ore at Newmont\u2019s Twin Creeks facility. The agreement supports plans to expand production and unlock the full potential of Turquoise Ridge by increasing processing capacity. It provides for throughput of 850,000 tons per year in 2018 and 2019, rising to 1.2 million tons per year between 2020 and 2024. Processing costs are in line with market rates, and are reflected in our guidance for Turquoise Ridge.\nPlease join our upcoming Investor Day webcast for a detailed update on all major operations. Visit www.barrick.com for webcast information, press release, and presentations on February 22.\nDigital Barrick\nDuring 2017, we laid the foundation for our digital transformation through a series of pilot projects primarily focused at our Cortez mine in Nevada. This allowed us to validate the viability of our digital solutions and their potential economic returns in a controlled environment with rigorous oversight.\nIn 2018, our digital strategy will focus on completing version one of the Barrick Data Fabric, an enterprise-grade, big data analytics platform. This will provide a unified data environment for the Company that will allow our leaders and operators to identify variability and trends, generate trusted, real-time data, predict failures, and take action to address problems quickly, or before they arise. We also will accelerate the implementation of digital projects across our other operations, with an initial focus in Nevada, including:\n- Expanded use of automated processing systems, combined with introduction of artificial intelligence;\n- Implementation of short interval control in open pit, underground, and processing areas;\n- Expanded implementation of digital work management and predictive maintenance systems; and\n- Expanded use of automation, including an autonomous open pit trial, and the implementation of automated underground drills.\nWe are taking a disciplined approach to our digital strategy and will continue to apply a high degree of rigor to these projects, just as we would for any other investment, to ensure that our investments in digital deliver the benefits we anticipate.\n| Gold | Fourth Quarter 2017 | Full Year 2017 | 2018 Guidance |\n| Production10 (000s of ounces) | 1,339 | 5,323 | 4,500 - 5,000 |\n| Cost of sales applicable to gold3 ($ per ounce) | 801 | 794 | 810 - 850 |\n| All-in sustaining costs4 ($ per ounce) | 756 | 750 | 765 - 815 |\n| Copper | |||\n| Production10 (millions of pounds) | 99 | 413 | 385 - 450 |\n| Cost of sales applicable to copper3 ($ per pound) | 1.79 | 1.77 | 1.80 - 2.10 |\n| All-in sustaining costs6 ($ per pound) | 2.51 | 2.34 | 2.30 - 2.60 |\n| Total Attributable Capital Expenditures11 ($ millions) | 365 | 1,364 | 1,400 - 1,600 |\nMINERAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT\nBarrick manages a high-quality inventory of gold reserves and resources, the majority of which are situated in regions where we have proven operating experience, a critical mass of infrastructure, technical and exploration expertise, and established partnerships with suppliers, host governments, and communities.\nOur 2017 reserves were calculated using a gold price assumption of $1,200 per ounce, consistent with the long-price assumption we used in 2016. As of December 31, 2017, Barrick\u2019s proven and probable gold reserves were 64.5 million ounces5, compared to 86.0 million ounces at the end of 2016. This decline primarily reflects the divestment of approximately 9.2 million ounces associated with Veladero and Cerro Casale, and the reclassification of approximately 14.0 million ounces of Pascua-Lama proven and probable gold reserves as measured and indicated resources.\nBarrick added 8.0 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves at existing operations (as well as the Goldrush project) through drilling, more than replacing the 6.2 million ounces depleted through processing last year. This success reflects increased investment in mine exploration drilling in 2017. Significant additions included 2.1 million ounces at Turquoise Ridge, 1.4 million ounces at Cortez, 1.3 million ounces at Goldstrike, 397,000 ounces at Hemlo, and 392,000 ounces at Lagunas Norte. We also declared an initial reserve of 1.5 million ounces at the Goldrush project. In addition, Barrick\u2019s 63.9 percent share of reserves at Acacia\u2019s North Mara mine increased by 504,000 ounces. The average grade of Barrick\u2019s reserves also increased by 17 percent, from 1.33 grams per tonne, to 1.55 grams per tonne.\nIn 2017, measured, indicated, and inferred gold resources were calculated using a gold price assumption of $1,500 per ounce, consistent with 2016. Measured and indicated gold resources increased to 88.6 million ounces5 at the end of 2017, compared to 75.2 million ounces at the end of 2016. Roughly 9.1 million ounces of measured and indicated gold resources were added as a result of the formation of the Norte Abierto joint venture (which includes the Cerro Casale and Caspiche deposits), net of resources divested at Cerro Casale and Veladero. Roughly 14.0 million ounces of measured and indicated resources were added as a result of the reclassification of Pascua-Lama reserves to resources, and 5.8 million ounces were added through drilling, including 1.5 million ounces at Goldstrike, 1.2 million ounces at Cortez, and 535,000 ounces at Hemlo.\nInferred gold resources increased slightly to 30.8 million ounces5 at the end of 2017, compared to 30.7 million ounces at the end of 2016.\nProven and probable copper reserves were calculated using a copper price of $2.75 per pound, consistent with the long-price assumption we used in 2016. Copper reserves, including copper within gold reserves, increased to 11.2 billion pounds5 at the end of 2017, compared to 11.1 billion pounds at the end of 2016. The Lumwana mine added approximately 2.6 billion pounds to its reserves as a result of successful cost reduction efforts. Approximately 1.4 billion pounds of copper reserves were divested with the sale of 25 percent of Cerro Casale, 554 million pounds were processed, and 505 million pounds of copper contained within gold reserves were reclassified as copper contained within gold resources.\nIn 2017, measured, indicated, and inferred copper resources were calculated using a copper price assumption of $3.50 per pound, consistent with 2016. Measured and indicated copper resources, including copper within measured and indicated gold resources, increased to 11.7 billion pounds5, compared to 9.7 billion pounds at the end of 2016. Approximately 2.6 billion pounds of measured and indicated copper resources were upgraded to copper reserves, 2.6 billion pounds were added through the inclusion of the Caspiche deposit, and 1.6 billion pounds were added through drilling. Inferred copper resources were 3.0 billion pounds5, compared to 3.1 billion pounds at the end of 2016.\nEXPLORATION UPDATE\nBarrick has a demonstrated track record of creating value through exploration. Since 1990, we have found 129 million ounces of gold at an overall discovery cost of $29 per ounce, or roughly half the average finding cost across the industry.\nApproximately 80 percent of our total exploration budget of $185-$225 million is allocated to the Americas. Our exploration programs balance high-quality brownfield projects, greenfield exploration, and emerging discoveries that have the potential to become profitable mines.\nWe successfully added 8.0 million ounces of gold reserves in 2017 through mine exploration drilling, demonstrating that even well-established operations continue to yield exploration success. In many cases, these ounces can be quickly incorporated into mine plans, driving improvements in production, cash flow, and earnings.\nFor example, we drilled more than 18,000 meters at Goldstrike in 2017, adding 1.3 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves, and 1.5 million ounces of measured and indicated resources. This drilling identified a host of high grade extensions to known lodes that will be a focus for further drilling in 2018. We also increased proven and probable gold reserves at Turquoise Ridge by 2.1 million ounces. Drilling down plunge of the mine\u2019s Foot Wall Pond Trend showed strong indications that the mineralized system continues along this corridor.\nOur 2018 greenfield exploration program will focus on the prolific Cortez district in Nevada, and the Frontera District on the El Indio Belt in Argentina and Chile. We have also cultivated active partnerships with a number of junior exploration and development companies as we seek to identify potential new core mineral districts for the Company. These partnerships are with ATAC at the Orion project in the Yukon, with Osisko at the Kan property in northern Qu\u00e9bec, and with Premier Gold at Cove McCoy in Nevada.\nPROJECTS UPDATE\nPlease join our upcoming Investor Day webcast for the latest updates on all major projects. Visit www.barrick.com for webcast information, press release, and presentations on February 22.\nWe continue to advance a pipeline of high-confidence projects at or near our existing operations, with the potential to contribute more than one million ounces of annual production to Barrick, at costs well below our current portfolio average.\nGoldrush has the potential to become Barrick\u2019s newest underground mine in Nevada, with first production expected as early as 2021, and sustained production by 2023. The prefeasibility study estimated average production of approximately 450,000 ounces of gold per year, at an average cost of sales3 of $800 per ounce, and average all-in sustaining costs4 of $665 per ounce.\nThrough the development of a third shaft, the Turquoise Ridge Joint Venture in Nevada has the potential to increase production to an average of 500,000 ounces per year (100 percent basis) at a cost of sales3 of $750-$800 per ounce, and all-in sustaining costs4 of about $625-$675 per ounce.\nThe Deep South project at Cortez will expand mining below currently permitted levels, and is expected to contribute average production of more than 300,000 ounces of gold per year from the underground mine, with initial production as early as 2023. The prefeasibility study estimated average cost of sales3 of $840 per ounce, and average all-in sustaining costs4 of $580 per ounce.12\nAt the Lagunas Norte operation in Peru, we are evaluating a phased project to extend the life of the mine by approximately 10 years. The first component involves installing grinding and carbon-in-leach processing. The second involves installation of a flotation and pressure oxidation circuit, allowing us to optimize the timing of capital expenditures.13\nWe also maintain a portfolio of greenfield projects that represent significant long-term value and optionality for our shareholders.\nDonlin Gold, located in Alaska, contains 19.5 million ounces5 of measured and indicated gold resources (Barrick\u2019s 50 percent share). We continue to work in collaboration with our partners at NOVAGOLD to optimize the project, including the potential for a staged development and selective mining.\nPascua-Lama, located on the border between Argentina and Chile, contains 21.3 million ounces5 of measured and indicated gold resources. We are now evaluating an underground, block-caving operation at Pascua-Lama that would utilize processing infrastructure in Argentina, while reducing the project\u2019s environmental impacts.\nNorte Abierto, our new joint venture with Goldcorp in Chile, incorporates the Cerro Casale and Caspiche deposits. Cerro Casale contains 11.6 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves5 (Barrick\u2019s 50 percent share), while Caspiche contains 11.6 million ounces of measured and indicated gold resources5 (Barrick\u2019s 50 percent share). Work is focused on advancing an optimized project design, including an updated geological model.\nThe Alturas project, located in Chile on the El Indio Belt, is a Barrick greenfield discovery with 6.8 million ounces5 of inferred gold resources as of December 31, 2017. Following completion of a scoping study for a conventional open pit heap leach operation at Alturas, we are now carrying out further studies to evaluate potential enhancements to the project design, while undertaking additional drilling to improve orebody knowledge and grades.\nACACIA MINING PLC\nIn October 2017, the Government of Tanzania and Barrick announced a proposed framework agreement that would split economic benefits generated by Acacia\u2019s operations with the Government of Tanzania on a 50/50 basis. The Government\u2019s portion would be delivered primarily in the form of royalties, taxes, and a 16 percent free carried interest in Acacia\u2019s Tanzanian operations, in line with the country\u2019s new mining law. Discussions concerning the implementation of the proposed framework, resolution of outstanding tax matters relating to Acacia, and the lifting of the country\u2019s export ban on concentrates, remain ongoing. Barrick has continued to engage with independent directors of Acacia throughout this process, and members of Acacia management are supporting ongoing discussions. We continue to target the first half of 2018 for the completion of a detailed proposal for review by Acacia.\nTECHNICAL INFORMATION\nThe scientific and technical information contained in this press release has been reviewed and approved by Steven Haggarty, P.

Adjusted net earnings excludes the following from net earnings: certain impairment charges (reversals) related to intangibles, goodwill, property, plant and equipment, and investments; gains (losses) and other one-time costs relating to acquisitions or dispositions; foreign currency translation gains (losses); significant tax adjustments not related to current period earnings; unrealized gains (losses) on non-hedge derivative instruments; and the tax effect and non-controlling interest of these items. The Company uses this measure internally to evaluate our underlying operating performance for the reporting periods presented and to assist with the planning and forecasting of future operating results. Barrick believes that adjusted net earnings is a useful measure of our performance because these adjusting items do not reflect the underlying operating performance of our core mining business and are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.

Barrick believes that the use of \u201ccash costs\u201d per ounce and \u201call-in sustaining costs\u201d per ounce will assist investors, analysts and other stakeholders in understanding the costs associated with producing gold, understanding the economics of gold mining, assessing our operating performance and also our ability to generate free cash flow from current operations and to generate free cash flow on an overall Company basis. \u201cCash costs\u201d per ounce and \u201cAll-in sustaining costs\u201d per ounce are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning under IFRS. Although a standardized definition of all-in sustaining costs was published in 2013 by the World Gold Council (a market development organization for the gold industry comprised of and funded by 23 gold mining companies from around the world, including Barrick), it is not a regulatory organization, and other companies may calculate this measure differently. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS.

We have already invested over 10% of the total capital required to complete the project, and the balance will be financed with cash on hand, supplemented by a combination of debt, equipment leasing, and equity,\u201d said Rob McEwen, Chairman and Chief Owner. \u201cExploration is advancing since the mine permits were received, and is already delivering encouraging results, which supports our belief that sustained exploration can extend the mine life,\u201d he added.\n\u201cKey changes were made to the implementation strategy of the Gold Bar Mine with the primary goal of reducing overall project risk while maintaining the highest possible capital efficiency. The installation of a crushing and agglomeration plant increased the capital costs by about 30% over our 2015 estimate. However, this is offset by a 20% increase in total gold production. We believe the increase in the capital investment is prudent, and will result in improved gold recoveries and reliable ore leaching on the pad,\u201d said Xavier Ochoa, President and Chief Operating Officer.\nHighlights of the Feasibility Study(1)\n- Capital expenditure of $81 million (of which $9.7 million has been spent to Jan 31, 2018).\n- Project pay-back period of 3 years at $1,250/oz gold and 2.5 years at $1,350/oz gold.\n- After-tax IRR of 23% at $1,250/oz gold and 32% at $1,350/oz gold.\n- After-tax NPV-5% of $54 million at $1,250/oz gold and $87 million at $1,350/oz gold.\n- Average annual gold production of 62,800 oz at a cash operating cost of $770/oz.\n- Updated Reserve Estimate of 16.5 million tons at a gold grade of 0.029 oz/t (1.0 g/t) resulting in 397,700 oz of gold produced over 7 years.\n- Updated Resource Estimate of 629,000 oz M&I and 115,000 oz Inferred.\n- Recent exploration around planned pit limits has returned positive results including(2):\n- Hole GB255: 0.062 oz/t (2.1 g/t) gold over 125 ft. (38.1 m);\n- Hole GB262: 0.028 oz/t (1.0 g/t) gold over 85 ft. (25.9 m); and\n- Hole GB257: 0.040 oz/t (1.4 g/t) gold over 55 ft.

Upon permit approval in November 2017, a property-wide exploration program started with the objectives of expanding the mineral inventory surrounding the planned open pits, and testing new targets.\nInitial drilling has focused on three areas: northwest of the planned Gold Pick open pit, northwest of the planned Gold Ridge open pit, and in-between Gold Pick and Gold Ridge (see Figure 1: Click here). Thirty-seven reverse circulation (RC) holes have been completed, and assay results from twenty-nine holes have been received. A new shallow oxide zone of mineralization has been identified in Hole GB257, which returned 0.040 oz/t (1.4 g/t) gold over 55 ft (16.8 m) starting at a depth of 30 ft (9 m). Seventeen holes encountered significant mineralization, with a weighted average grade and thickness of 0.030 oz/t (1 g/t) gold over 50 ft (15.2 m), comparable to the average grade of the deposit. Results from the new drilling are summarized below.\nTable 7: 2017-2018 Exploration Drilling Results\n| U.S. Standard Units | Metric Units | |||||||\n| Hole ID(8) | From (ft) | To (ft) | Thickness (ft)(7) | Gold Grade (oz/t) | From (m) | To (m) | Thickness (m)(7) | Gold Grade (g/t) |\n| GB251 | 300 | 320 | 20 | 0.078 | 91.4 | 97.5 | 6.1 | 2.66 |\n| And | 355 | 370 | 15 | 0.051 | 108.2 | 112.8 | 4.6 | 1.74 |\n| GB252 | 185 | 195 | 10 | 0.012 | 56.4 | 59.4 | 3.0 | 0.42 |\n| GB253 | 375 | 400 | 25 | 0.074 | 114.3 | 121.9 | 7.6 | 2.53 |\n| GB254 | 290 | 330 | 40 | 0.017 | 88.4 | 100.6 | 12.2 | 0.58 |\n| GB255 | 190 | 315 | 125 | 0.062 | 57.9 | 96.0 | 38.1 | 2.13 |\n| GB256 | 25 | 80 | 55 | 0.023 | 7.6 | 24.4 | 16.8 | 0.78 |\n| GB257 | 30 | 85 | 55 | 0.040 | 9.1 | 25.9 | 16.8 | 1.36 |\n| GB260 | 220 | 240 | 20 | 0.029 | 67.1 | 73.2 | 6.1 | 1.00 |\n| GB261 | 220 | 255 | 35 | 0.020 | 67.1 | 77.7 | 10.7 | 0.69 |\n| GB262 | 185 | 270 | 85 | 0.028 | 56.4 | 82.3 | 25.9 | 0.97 |\n| And | 290 | 305 | 15 | 0.029 | 88.4 | 93.0 | 4.6 | 0.99 |\n| GB264 | 625 | 650 | 25 | 0.040 | 190.5 | 198.1 | 7.6 | 1.37 |\n| GB265 | 440 | 490 | 50 | 0.014 | 134.1 | 149.4 | 15.2 | 0.48 |\n| GB267 | 320 | 390 | 70 | 0.016 | 97.5 | 118.9 | 21.3 | 0.55 |\n| GB274 | 270 | 345 | 75 | 0.021 | 82.3 | 96.0 | 22.8 | 0.73 |\n| GB275 | 255 | 265 | 10 | 0.012 | 77.7 | 80.8 | 3.0 | 0.40 |\n| GB276 | 315 | 405 | 90 | 0.021 | 96 | 123.4 | 27.4 | 0.72 |\n| GB280 | 255 | 280 | 25 | 0.013 | 77.7 | 85.3 | 7.6 | 0.45 |\n| Table 7 Notes: | ||\n| 7. | All intercepts are true width. | |\n| 8. | Holes GB250, 263, 266, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 277, 278, and 279 did not return significant gold values. | |\nMineral Resource Estimate\nSRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc.

Test work shows that ore is amenable to heap leach cyanidation with high gold recoveries and relatively rapid leaching kinetics. There is a significant amount of metallurgical testing on the Gold Bar ore bodies, including new work completed since the last feasibility study published in 2015. The terminal gold recovery used in the FS is 82%, which is based on the crushed and agglomerated ore testing below. The assumption of 82% recovery is conservatively set below representative results from laboratory testing. For example, actual empirical results for the 36\u201d column test described below predict 82% recovery after 30 days of leaching and ultimate recovery of 89% after 120 days. The FS assumes 50% recovery after 30 days and ultimate recovery of 82% after 180 days.\nTable 11: Results of Additional Metallurgical Test Work Since 2015 Feasibility Study\n| Column Diameter (inches) | Crush Size (inches) | Calculated Gold Grade (oz/t) | Gold Recovery (%) | Leach Days | Sodium Cyanide Consumption (lb/t) | Lime Added (lb/t) | Cement Added (lb/t) |\n| Agglomerated Large Diameter Column Leach Tests | |||||||\n| 36\u201d | 6\u201d | 0.035 | 89 | 120 | 0.29 | - | 11.14 |\n| 24\u201d | \u00be\u201d | 0.037 | 93 | 70 | 0.52 | - | 5.06 |\n| 24\u201d | \u00be\u201d | 0.150 | 97 | 70 | 0.93 | - | 5.24 |\n| 24\u201d | \u00be\u201d | 0.050 | 92 | 70 | 0.73 | - | 5.08 |\n| 24\u201d | \u00be\u201d | 0.051 | 92 | 70 | 0.67 | - | 5.14 |\n| 24\u201d | \u00be\u201d | 0.056 | 95 | 57 | 1.13 | - | 5.04 |\n| Non-Agglomerated Large Diameter Column Leach Tests | |||||||\n| 24\u201d | 4\u201d | 0.037 | 89 | 76 | 0.43 | 2.12 | - |\n| 24\u201d | 2\u201d | 0.037 | 91 | 70 | 0.51 | 2.07 | - |\n| 24\u201d | 4\u201d | 0.123 | 93 | 76 | 0.62 | 2.14 | - |\n| 24\u201d | 2\u201d | 0.124 | 95 | 70 | 0.94 | 3.20 | - |\n| 24\u201d | 4\u201d | 0.042 | 91 | 76 | 0.58 | 2.01 | - |\n| 24\u201d | 2\u201d | 0.053 | 92 | 70 | 0.74 | 3.11 | - |\n| 24\u201d | 4\u201d | 0.068 | 90 | 76 | 0.65 | 2.03 | - |\n| 24\u201d | 2\u201d | 0.071 | 93 | 70 | 0.67 | 2.94 | - |\n| 24\u201d | 2\u201d | 0.040 | 91 | 57 | 0.34 | 3.07 | - |\n| 24\u201d | 2\u201d | 0.045 | 91 | 57 | 0.85 | 3.06 | - |\n| 24\u201d | 2\u201d | 0.040 | 90 | 57 | 1.47 | 3.04 | - |\n| 24\u201d | \u00be\u201d | 0.037 | 92 | 57 | 0.72 | 3.05 | - |\n| 24\u201d | \u00be\u201d | 0.040 | 92 | 57 | 1.02 | 3.07 | - |\n| 24\u201d | \u00be\u201d | 0.037 | 91 | 57 | 2.08 | 3.03 | - |\n| 24\u201d | 2\u201d | 0.054 | 96 | 57 | 1.17 | 3.05 | - |\n| 24\u201d | \u00be\u201d | 0.047 | 97 | 57 | 1.22 | 3.03 | - |\n| 24\u201d | 2\u201d | 0.043 | 85 | 57 | 0.98 | 3.04 | - |\n| 24\u201d | \u00be\u201d | 0.043 | 91 | 57 | 1.06 | 3.03 | - |\n| 24\u201d | 2\u201d | 0.051 | 95 | 57 | 1.43 | 3.06 | - |\nABOUT MCEWEN MINING\nMcEwen has the goal to qualify for inclusion in the S&P 500 Index by creating a profitable gold and silver producer focused in the Americas.

These standards are different from the standards generally permitted in reports filed with the SEC. Under NI 43-101, McEwen Mining reports measured, indicated and inferred resources, measurements, which are generally not permitted in filings made with the SEC. The estimation of measured resources and indicated resources involve greater uncertainty as to their existence and economic feasibility than the estimation of proven and probable reserves. U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that any part of measured or indicated resources will ever be converted into economically mineable reserves.

In one note of concern, despite the increase, single-family homebuilding did decline 3.7% while permits for construction also dropped to their lowest level since September 2017. The declines may suggest a slowing real estate market.\nIndustrial production gave a positive sign as factories increased output more than expected with particular strength in business equipment and cars.\nMeanwhile, amid a slate of Federal Reserve policymakers scheduled for appearances on Tuesday, current SF Fed president John Williams -who will take over for William Dudley at the pivotal NY Fed in June- repeated his view that the U.S. central bank should continue on the gradual rate hike path to reduce the risk of the economy overheating.\nMinneapolis Fed chief Neel Kashkari responded to a Wall Street Journal article via Twitter, insisting that there was no \u201cextreme labor shortage\u201d and that businesses were simply unwilling to pay for higher quality workers.\nAt the time of writing, in semi-annual testimony to Congress, Fed governor Randal Quarles stuck to the topic of bank supervision and had yet to make any references to monetary policy.\nStill on the docket, Patrick Harker, Charles Evans and Raphael Bostic will make appearances later on Tuesday as investors look out for any clues on the future path of interest rates.\nTraders are currently pricing in around a 95% chance of a rate hike in June, according to Investing.com\u2019s Fed Rate Monitor Tool.

These risks can heighten mining risk because of the elevated geopolitical and financial risks, potentially disrupting supply, and driving up gold prices even further without gold demand increasing. Are these the catalysts that will push up higher gold prices?\nHistory Repeats\nOver a long-term enough time horizon, the sixteen biggest risk events repeat, but with a slight twist. The risks are the same, but the characters in the play are different. Capital controls, nationalization of assets, labor disputes, increased regulation on assets, and royalty changes. They all have occurred during different time periods, at some point or another. Most are tied to miners generating an incredible amount of profits, and individual countries wanting to get a bigger share of those revenues. It\u2019s hard to move a mine, putting the mine at increased operational and political risk to earn more on those assets.\nGeopolitical Risks\nGeopolitical Escalations Disrupting the Supply-chain\nGovernment Election Uncertainty\nTariffs (on Mine Supplies)\nExport Restrictions of Commodities\nSupply disruptions from geopolitical are at heightened levels of risk not seen since the 1930\u2019s and 1940\u2019s, because of increased geopolitical risks. All of this political uncertainty increased demand for all private assets (not just gold).There is a shift from public assets to private assets.\nGeopolitical risks are always the hardest for management and investors to get a firm grip on. It requires so many \u201cifs or if that\u201d, to really pinpoint which will do harm to the mine operations. The geopolitical risks can impact other items that impact funding of the operations like capital controls or the mine operations supplies. A simple solution for investors to mitigate geopolitical risk is to see if the miner has its operations across more than one country, to limit any country-specific risk.\nThere are also several general elections in 2018 and 2019 in commodity-specific countries. Mexico is a significant gold and silver mining producer, and it is having elections in 2018. Brazil also has its general election in 2018, its second largest export commodity in dollar value is gold. Brazil also produces more than 90% of the worlds Niobium, third largest producer of iron ore, and sixth largest producer of aluminum. Heightened political matters will only increase throughout 2018 and continue into 2019, adding to already heightened geopolitical issues.\nFinancial Risks\nEconomic Slowdown\nETF margin requirements reducing liquidity in mining ETF impacting financing\nFinancial Taxation Changes by Governments\nBail-in Risk to cash balance\nRising Interest Rates\nCash held Government Bonds \u2013 Debt Jubilee\nThe world continues to work through the debt issues, that have not been resolved since 2008 financial crisis. The risks at banks continue to remain elevated, particularly the European banks. We expect there will be a debt jubilee in some form, with shorter duration government bonds being converted into longer-dated bonds. Companies that are holding shorter-term term government paper as \u201csafe\u201d allocation for their cash, will be caught off guard if their government paper is re-adjusted to a longer duration. Corporate bonds are a better alternative.\nFor Canadian and Australian miners they also face the added bail-in risk of deposits. Federal governments have explicitly stated that they will consider bail-in options, issuing depositors a clear warning. However, \u201cThis will never happen to us\u201d management teams always say. Well, they have before, and they will again. If governments are already warning you what they will do in the next crash, and you fail to heed their warning. The list of repeat offenders is quite long.\nEven Goldman Sachs CEO, Lloyd Blankfein is warning about the sovereign crisis coming next:\n\u201cWhat is kind of a little bit off. A lot of the bank issues in the United States and around the world have been solved. But migrating the problem to the sovereign balance sheets. So the banks look pretty good, but the Fed has $4 trillion of debt on its balance sheet. And it\u2019s even more, we are not in a European audience. In Europe, they would really know what they meant because all the European banking system is fixed but Europeans are all also buying up all the debt. The budget deficits haven\u2019t contracted, they\u2019ve widened. The banks buy the debt, then walk over to the European Central bank, finance it. Get new money, so they can buy the next round of debt\u201d.\nSo, you have countries with way bigger deficits, as a percentage of GDP than the U.S., that is borrowing money for ten years, at 3.0% or 2.5%. Really?And the banks look ok.\n\u201cIt is the sovereigns that look risky, like Greece. You wonder if the next crisis going to be a sovereign crisis? And if it is, it will just be a continuation. People will look back and say, what we really did. We didn\u2019t fix the outcome of the financial crisis. We left that open and as a result, its really been a thirty-year workout.\u201dLloyd Blankfein [CNBC]\nThis Could Never Happen?\nLate in the Cycle Commodity Issues\nLabor price issues\nGovernment Expropriation Risks\nRoyalty Regime increases on mining assets\nInvestors, who say that any of the above risks can never happen, fail to learn the lessons of history to see that, yes, these events have happened and they impacted miners at one point or another. They have impacted many miners over the past 30 years. My experience has taught me, that most investors only really look back far enough to the last crash as to what could happen.\nEvery one of these late in the cycles issues (labor price pressures, government expropriation, royalty regime increases) have always all occurred during the last mining boom. We don\u2019t see these late in the cycle commodity risks evident in gold and silver stocks at this time. Look at cobalt and the skyrocketing price increases. This resulted in governments stepping in and raising cobalt taxes. Investors and management should not be surprised that this occurred, but human beings rarely learn from the past lessons.\nFor the longer cycle-related events, the time period is much longer than the typical business cycle. By taking into account the business cycle and debt cycles in conjunction with the commodity cycle, you can see where the events will take place. One of my leading long-term bearish indicators in any industry is the regulation card because it has historically highlighted the top in the industry. The mining sector is not there yet.\nThis article was written by Paul Farrugia, BCom. Paul is the President & CEO of First Macro Capital.

Capitalized stripping at Lumwana was also higher than first quarter, in line with the mine plan, leading to consolidated all-in sustaining costs per pound2 that are approximately 15-17 percent higher than the first quarter.\nWe are adjusting our 2018 copper production guidance to 345-410 million pounds, compared to our initial guidance of 385-450 million pounds.3 We also expect copper cost of sales per pound1 to be $2.00-$2.30, C1 cash costs2 to be $1.80-$2.00 per pound, and all-in sustaining costs2 to be $2.55-$2.85 per pound.3 This compares to initial guidance of $1.80-$2.10 per pound, $1.55-$1.75 per pound, and $2.30-$2.60 per pound, respectively. The revisions to our copper production and cost guidance primarily reflect operational challenges at Lumwana in the first half of the year. We expect higher production at Lumwana in the second half of 2018, driven by a steady improvement in grade and improved crusher reliability.\nBarrick will provide additional discussion and analysis regarding second quarter production and sales when the Company reports quarterly results on July 25, 2018, followed by a conference call and webcast on July 26 at 8:00 am ET.

Eng., Manager, Metallurgy of Barrick who is a \u201cQualified Person\u201d as defined in National Instrument 43-101 \u2013 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.\nSECOND QUARTER 2018 RESULTS\nBarrick will release its Second Quarter 2018 Results on July 25, 2018, followed by a conference call and webcast on July 26 at 8:00 am ET.\nToll Free (U.S. and Canada): 1-800-319-4610\nInternational: +1 416 915-3239\nThe webcast and presentation materials will be available on Barrick\u2019s website. The conference call will be available for replay by phone at 1-855-669-9658 (U.S. and Canada toll free), and +1 604 674-8052 (international), access code 2352.\nENDNOTE 1\nCost of sales applicable to gold per ounce is calculated using cost of sales applicable to gold on an attributable basis (removing the non-controlling interest of 40% Pueblo Viejo and 36.1% Acacia from cost of sales), divided by attributable gold ounces. Cost of sales applicable to copper per pound is calculated using cost of sales applicable to copper including our proportionate share of cost of sales attributable to equity method investments (Zald\u00edvar and Jabal Sayid), divided by consolidated copper pounds (including our proportionate share of copper pounds from our equity method investments).\nENDNOTE 2\nCash costs per ounce and all-in sustaining costs per ounce are non-GAAP financial measures which are calculated based on the definition published by the World Gold Council (\u201cWGC\u201d) (a market development organization for the gold industry comprised of and funded by 24 gold mining companies from around the world, including Barrick). The WGC is not a regulatory organization. Management uses these measures to monitor the performance of our gold mining operations and its ability to generate positive cash flow, both on an individual site basis and an overall company basis.\nCash costs start with our cost of sales related to gold production and removes depreciation, the non-controlling interest of cost of sales and includes by-product credits. All-in sustaining costs start with cash costs and include sustaining capital expenditures, general and administrative costs, minesite exploration and evaluation costs and reclamation cost accretion and amortization. These additional costs reflect the expenditures made to maintain current production levels.\nWe believe that our use of cash costs and all-in sustaining costs will assist analysts, investors and other stakeholders of Barrick in understanding the costs associated with producing gold, understanding the economics of gold mining, assessing our operating performance and also our ability to generate free cash flow from current operations and to generate free cash flow on an overall company basis. Due to the capital-intensive nature of the industry and the long useful lives over which these items are depreciated, there can be a significant timing difference between net earnings calculated in accordance with IFRS and the amount of free cash flow that is being generated by a mine and therefore we believe these measures are useful non-GAAP operating metrics and supplement our IFRS disclosures. These measures are not representative of all of our cash expenditures as they do not include income tax payments, interest costs or dividend payments. These measures do not include depreciation or amortization.\nCash costs per ounce and all-in sustaining costs are intended to provide additional information only and do not have standardized definitions under IFRS, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. These measures are not equivalent to net income or cash flow from operations as determined under IFRS. Although the WGC has published a standardized definition, other companies may calculate these measures differently.\nC1 cash costs per pound and all-in sustaining costs per pound are non-GAAP financial measures related to our copper mine operations. We believe that C1 cash costs per pound enables investors to better understand the performance of our copper operations in comparison to other copper producers who present results on a similar basis. C1 cash costs per pound excludes royalties and non-routine charges as they are not direct production costs. All-in sustaining costs per pound is similar to the gold all-in sustaining costs metric and management uses this to better evaluate the costs of copper production. We believe this measure enables investors to better understand the operating performance of our copper mines as this measure reflects all of the sustaining expenditures incurred in order to produce copper. All-in sustaining costs per pound includes C1 cash costs, corporate general and administrative costs, minesite exploration and evaluation costs, royalties, environmental rehabilitation costs and write-downs taken on inventory to net realizable value.\nBarrick will provide a full reconciliation of our final non-GAAP financial measures when the Company reports its quarterly results on July 25, 2018.\nENDNOTE 3\n2018 guidance is based on gold, copper, WTI oil price and Brent oil price assumptions of $1,200/oz, $2.75/lb, $65/bbl and $70/bbl respectively, a USD:AUD exchange rate of 0.75:1, a CAD:USD exchange rate of 1.25:1, a ARS:USD exchange rate of 18.35:1 and a CLP:USD exchange rate of 650:1.\nENDNOTE 4\nIncludes our 60% equity share of South Arturo.\nENDNOTE 5\nReflects our 50% equity share of Veladero.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING PRELIMINARY SECOND QUARTER PRODUCTION, SALES AND COSTS FOR 2018 AND FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\nBarrick cautions that, whether or not expressly stated, all second quarter figures contained in this press release including, without limitation, production levels and sales and associated costs (including, costs of sales per ounce for gold and per pound for copper, all-in sustaining costs per ounce/pound, cash costs per ounce, and C1 cash costs per pound) are preliminary and reflect our expected second quarter results as of the date of this press release. Actual reported second quarter production levels and sales and associated costs are subject to management\u2019s final review, as well as review by the Company\u2019s independent accounting firm, and may vary significantly from those expectations because of a number of factors, including, without limitation, additional or revised information, and changes in accounting standards or policies, or in how those standards are applied. Barrick will provide additional discussion and analysis and other important information about its second quarter production levels and sales and associated costs when it reports actual results on July 25, 2018. For a complete picture of the Company\u2019s financial performance, it will be necessary to review all of the information in the Company\u2019s second quarter financial report and related MD&A. Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to rely solely on the information contained herein.\nFinally, Barrick cautions that this press release contains forward-looking statements with respect to (i) Barrick\u2019s forward-looking production guidance; (ii) estimates of future cost of sales per ounce for gold and per pound for copper, all-in sustaining costs per ounce/pound, cash costs per ounce, and C1 cash costs per pound; and (iii) expectations regarding operations during the second half of 2018 at Barrick Nevada, Pueblo Viejo, Porgera and Lumwana.\nForward-looking statements are necessarily based upon a number of estimates and assumptions including material estimates and assumptions related to the factors set forth below that, while considered reasonable by the Company as at the date of this press release in light of management\u2019s experience and perception of current conditions and expected developments, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. Known and unknown factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements, and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements and information. Such factors include, but are not limited to: fluctuations in the spot and forward price of gold, copper, or certain other commodities (such as silver, diesel fuel, natural gas, and electricity); the speculative nature of mineral exploration and development; changes in mineral production performance, exploitation, and exploration successes; risks associated with the fact that certain Best-in-Class initiatives are still in the early stages of evaluation, and additional engineering and other analysis is required to fully assess their impact; risks associated with the ongoing implementation of Barrick\u2019s digital transformation initiative, and the ability of the projects under this initiative to meet the Company\u2019s capital allocation objectives; the duration of the Tanzanian ban on mineral concentrate exports; the ultimate terms of any definitive agreement between Acacia and the Government of Tanzania to resolve a dispute relating to the imposition of the concentrate export ban and allegations by the Government of Tanzania that Acacia under-declared the metal content of concentrate exports from Tanzania and related matters; whether Acacia will approve the terms of any final agreement reached between Barrick and the Government of Tanzania with respect to the dispute between Acacia and the Government of Tanzania; the benefits expected from recent transactions being realized; diminishing quantities or grades of reserves; increased costs, delays, suspensions and technical challenges associated with the construction of capital projects; operating or technical difficulties in connection with mining or development activities, including geotechnical challenges and disruptions in the maintenance or provision of required infrastructure and information technology systems; failure to comply with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations; timing of receipt of, or failure to comply with, necessary permits and approvals; uncertainty whether some or all of the Best-in-Class initiatives, targeted investments and projects will meet the Company\u2019s capital allocation objectives and internal hurdle rate; the impact of global liquidity and credit availability on the timing of cash flows and the values of assets and liabilities based on projected future cash flows; the impact of inflation; fluctuations in the currency markets; changes in national and local government legislation, taxation, controls or regulations and/ or changes in the administration of laws, policies and practices, expropriation or nationalization of property and political or economic developments in Canada, the United States, and other jurisdictions in which the Company or its affiliates do or may carry on business in the future; lack of certainty with respect to foreign legal systems, corruption and other factors that are inconsistent with the rule of law; damage to the Company\u2019s reputation due to the actual or perceived occurrence of any number of events, including negative publicity with respect to the Company\u2019s handling of environmental matters or dealings with community groups, whether true or not; the possibility that future exploration results will not be consistent with the Company\u2019s expectations; risks that exploration data may be incomplete and considerable additional work may be required to complete further evaluation, including but not limited to drilling, engineering and socioeconomic studies and investment; risk of loss due to acts of war, terrorism, sabotage and civil disturbances; litigation and legal and administrative proceedings; contests over title to properties, particularly title to undeveloped properties, or over access to water, power and other required infrastructure; business opportunities that may be presented to, or pursued by, the Company; our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions or complete divestitures; risks associated with working with partners in jointly controlled assets; employee relations including loss of key employees; increased costs and physical risks, including extreme weather events and resource shortages, related to climate change; and availability and increased costs associated with mining inputs and labor. In addition, there are risks and hazards associated with the business of mineral exploration, development and mining, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected formations, pressures, cave-ins, flooding and gold bullion, copper cathode or gold or copper concentrate losses (and the risk of inadequate insurance, or inability to obtain insurance, to cover these risks).\nMany of these uncertainties and contingencies can affect our actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, us. Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. All of the forward-looking statements made in this press release are qualified by these cautionary statements. Specific reference is made to the most recent Form 40-F/Annual Information Form on file with the SEC and Canadian provincial securities regulatory authorities for a more detailed discussion of some of the factors underlying forward-looking statements and the risks that may affect Barrick\u2019s ability to achieve the expectations set forth in the forward-looking statements contained in this press release.\nBarrick disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.",

Barrick is open to copper assets \"as long as that copper is a component or co-product to the gold,\" said Rod Quick, who heads Randgold's projects and evaluation and will do the same in the merged company. \"Or, unless that copper project will enhance our strategic partner network.\" In Africa, Barrick is open to exploiting its \"substantial footprint\" in the Democratic Republic of Congo to acquire world-class deposits, said Willem Jacobs, who heads Randgold's operations in central and east Africa and becomes Chief Operating Officer of Barrick's Africa and Middle East region. In Zambia, Barrick aims to lower costs at its \"relatively low-grade\" Lumwana copper mine, he added, noting the country's new mining code stands to materially affect margins. Barrick said it is keen on exploration outside its operating base, flagging South America's Guyana Shield, which crosses Suriname, Guyana and French Guyana. It also wants more exposure in Canada. Rob Krcmarov, executive vice president of exploration, said Barrick is interested in \"copper opportunities\" within its operating regions that meet investment criteria. To approve projects with potential for more than 5 million ounces of gold, Barrick will require a 15-percent rate of return, based on a $1,000 gold price, said Quick. Projects with more than 3 million ounces of gold, need a 20-percent return. Barrick expects stronger operating cash flows, non-core asset sales and lower overhead and interest costs will help it increase future dividends, said Randgold Chief Financial Officer Graham Shuttleworth, who takes the same role at Barrick. Talks are underway to sell Barrick's Lagunas Norte mine, said Mark Hill, COO of Latin America. Barrick said in August the Peru mine was an example of the non-core mines it would look at selling. Reuters reported last year that Barrick was exploring options, including the sale of all or part of, Lagunas Norte.

It was still unclear whether a decisive vote on the bill would occur then.\nOn Wall Street overnight, major indexes marked gains, with sentiment lifted by apparent progress toward passage of the tax legislation.

The House had approved its own tax bill on Nov. 16.\nNews of McCain's nod had pushed up U.S. Treasury yields to five-week highs, which underpinned the recently beleaguered dollar.\nYields also got a lift boost from U.S. data showing a rise in inflation and a decline in jobless claims, reinforcing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will hike interest rates later this month, and several times in 2018.\nBut the greenback gave up some of those gains on Friday as yields edged lower after the tax vote's postponement.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield stood at 2.408 percent in Asian trade, below its U.S. close of 2.415 percent on Thursday.\n\"We had good U.S. data overnight that added to rate increase expectations, but until there is an outcome on the tax reform vote, markets cannot move much,\" said Harumi Taguchi, principal economist at IHS Markit in Tokyo.",

We\u2019re now back to the issues, and 2018 could be a make-it-or-break-it moment for Trump.\nJohnny has enjoyed his \u201cEverybody is a Winner\u201d trophy. Now, it\u2019s time to separate the winners from the losers. Here are my top ideas for ETFs to buy for the coming new year!\nBest ETFs to Buy for 2018: Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)\nSource: Shutterstock\nTechnology was smoking hot this year, as it was the last. As proof, over the trailing one-year period, the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLK) gained nearly 36%. This amazing performance beat out every other S&P 500 sector fund, according to data compiled by Stockcharts.com.\nNaturally, the XLK belongs on anyone\u2019s ETFs to buy list, including any fellow contrarians. Like most folks, I don\u2019t like to chase my investments up. That doesn\u2019t mean you should wait for a pullback either. Considering the enormous potential of the technology sector, a pullback may be a long time coming.\nToday, a tech investment isn\u2019t just about computers, devices and core components. It\u2019s taking the next step forward, from a merely useful tool to one that has an intelligence of its own.\nAmong the XLK\u2019s top holdings include Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Both companies pioneered evolutions in data analytics and predictive technologies, and both will be mainstays in the industries of tomorrow.\nYes, the XLK has enjoyed stellar returns recently. Don\u2019t read too much into this. Sometimes, a good performance is just a good performance!\nBest ETFs to Buy for 2018: ARK ETF Trust (ARKW)\nSource: Shutterstock\nWhile we\u2019re on the subject of technology, I want to bring to your attention another same-sector fund: ARK ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:ARKW). The ARKW is an actively-managed fund that focuses on companies working in next-generation sectors, like cloud computing and Big Data. It has a nice mixture of recognizable names, as well as lesser-known speculative companies.\nBut the only name that you need to worry about is Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTCMKTS:GBTC). As the top holding in the ARKW, this fund is banking heavily on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. While that may seem like an unnecessarily heavy risk, I believe the ARKW will pay off handsomely.\nAs I have written about extensively, bitcoin and the blockchain are the ultimate disruptors. Everything that we know about business and finance will change over the next several years. As such, the bitcoin rally \u2014 which is currently approaching $12,000 \u2014 is only just beginning.\nOf course, I understand people\u2019s hesitation toward a completely alien investment class. If you don\u2019t want to invest directly into cryptocurrencies, take a shot at ARKW.\nBest ETFs to Buy for 2018: iShares Dow Jones US Aerospace & Def.ETF (ITA)\nSource: Shutterstock\nIf you watch something called \u201cthe news,\u201d you\u2019ll immediately understand why I include the iShares Dow Jones US Aerospace & Def.ETF (NYSEARCA:ITA) in my best ETFs to buy list.\nThe North Korean missile crisis is very real, and no longer an \u201cAsian problem.\u201d For decades, both liberal and conservative administrations did nothing as North Korea perfected its intercontinental ballistic missile technology. Now, according to physicists, the rogue nation has the capability to hit Los Angeles in under 40 minutes.\nWe\u2019re dealing with a complete madman who is attempting to blackmail the U.S. into submission. Furthermore, the asymmetric nature of this conflict favors North Korea \u2014 we simply have much more to lose.\nTo send a strong message to North Korea, as well as to its allies, China and Russia, we need to demonstrate that a \u201crain of hate\u201d will fall upon any country that attempts to incinerate Americans. This intense situation practically guarantees that ITA and the defense industry will have many profitable years to come.\nBest ETFs to Buy for 2018: iShares MSCI Japan ETF (EWJ)\nSource: Shutterstock\nIn my opinion, one of the most underappreciated international ETFs to buy is the iShares MSCI Japan ETF (NYSEARCA:EWJ). I don\u2019t blame anyone for overlooking the EWJ because quite frankly, Japan suffers from a credibility problem. For several years, administration after failed administration attempted to address Japan\u2019s woeful economy, dubbed the \u201cLost Decade.\u201d\nShould any more failed attempts occur, Japan would have been on track to suffer a \u201cLost Century.\u201d Thankfully, a man named Shinzo Abe appears to have discovered the magic formula. While Abe is controversial (he was recently embroiled in a cronyism scandal), his powerful leadership secured him more time. This added stability is crucial for the EWJ, as well as for the entire nation.\nJudging by the performance of core companies like Sony Corp (ADR) (NYSE:SNE), \u201cAbenomics\u201d appears to be working. Moreover, President Trump essentially mocked Prime Minister Abe \u2014 you have to read between the lines \u2014 due to Japan\u2019s apparent \u201cunwillingness\u201d to pay for its defense.\nAn alarming lack of historical context aside, Trump might push Japan to re-arm. That may trigger Japan to bolster its armament industry, which should have a long-term, positive impact on the EWJ.\nBest ETFs to Buy for 2018: SPDR Gold Trust (ETF)\nSource: Shutterstock\nWhile many of us are eagerly awaiting the new year, we also recognize that the world is going insane. Both domestic and abroad, we\u2019ve been inundated with tragedies, senseless violence, political unrest, and even the threat of nuclear war. In times like these, nothing shines brighter than gold. But if you don\u2019t want to lug around physical bullion, the SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSEARCA:GLD) is a nice alternative.\nTo be blunt, every year to a \u201cgold bug\u201d is the year. Back when commodities were the hot-ticket items, precious metal experts predicted that gold prices would hit $10,000. Silver, in turn, would hit $500. People are still making these predictions, along with incredibly dubious world-events forecasts. Strangely enough, it was bitcoin and Ethereum, not gold and silver, that hit $10,000 and nearly hit $500, respectively.\nWith all that said, 2018 really could be the year for gold and the GLD. Geopolitical tensions have never been this bad. We\u2019re engaged in both hot wars and cold wars. Our nation is extremely divided, with unreal developments like the rise of white nationalism becoming all too real.\nThe GLD doesn\u2019t solve any of these problems. What it typically does is jump on the fear trade, and there\u2019s plenty of that going around.\nBest ETFs to Buy for 2018: Sprott Physical Platinum and Palladium Trust (SPPP)\nSource: Shutterstock\nNear the beginning of October, I noticed a remarkable event: platinum\u2019s spot price dipped into the low-$900 range. That by itself wasn\u2019t remarkable, as the precious metals have been disappointing for years. Rather, gold bullion was priced somewhere around $1,270. At that moment, gold was priced nearly 40% higher than platinum.\nI try not to argue with the markets. Nevertheless, not only did that make no sense, that couldn\u2019t make sense! A commonly-cited statistic is that all the gold ever mined could fit into an Olympic-size swimming pool. Gold is rare. But all the platinum mined in human history could fit into an average-sized living room. Platinum is exponentially rarer, which is why I like the Sprott Physical Platinum and Palladium Trust (NYSEARCA:SPPP).\nAlthough physical bullion is much more fun to acquire, the SPPP has a significant advantage. Physical platinum features wide bid-ask spreads, making profitability more challenging. Furthermore, the platinum market isn\u2019t nearly as liquid as gold. With the SPPP, you can enjoy trading in relatively robust markets without having to deal with storage and security.\nFinally, the SPPP gives you coverage on palladium. With the exception of 2015, palladium has been a consistent winner among the deflated precious metals. I expect that trend to continue, given palladium\u2019s rarity and the fact that Russia controls most of the supply.\nBest ETFs to Buy for 2018: iShares MSCI Chile Inv. Mt. Idx. Fd(ETF) (ECH)\nSource: Shutterstock\nOne of my favorite international ETFs to buy is the iShares MSCI Chile Inv. Mt. Idx. Fd(ETF) (NYSEARCA:ECH). While I have no issues investing in standard or popular funds, I receive greater satisfaction finding lesser known, obscure names. Of course, none of these emotional sentiments matter if you\u2019re not profitable. Fortunately, ECH has proven to be a powerhouse.\nI first featured ECH back in August of 2016. Since then, the Chile-centric fund has gained more than 20% in the markets. Up until recently, the ECH had gained 37% since the date of publication. However, the fund took a sharp dive as a massive correction in Chilean markets sunk all boats. Nevertheless, the ECH is up 20% for the year.\nMoving forward, I view the current dip as a buying opportunity. For all the talk of next-gen technologies, none of them would pass muster without commodities. Among the most important commodities for the tech sector is lithium. Chile is one of three countries sitting in the \u201clithium triangle,\u201d which also includes Bolivia and Argentina.\nAlthough Chile is not considered a tech hub, it might as well be. Advanced nations like Japan and Australia are making heavy inroads into the lithium triangle, and that trend will only rise. Despite some volatility, over the long run, the ECH is one of the best ETFs to buy for 2018.\nBest ETFs to Buy for 2018: SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Explore & Prod. (ETF) (XOP)\nSource: Shutterstock\nSince the energy market collapse that began in 2014, oil companies have represented a poor place to park your money. Multiply that sentiment five-fold for oil and gas exploration units. As one of the more speculative branches of an already speculative industry, exploration companies were destined to get the full brunt of the fallout.\nHowever, 2018 might be the year that fortunes change. That\u2019s why I\u2019m keeping a close eye on the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Explore & Prod. (ETF) (NYSEARCA:XOP). One of the advantages of buying into a deflated sector is that remaining names are typically the strongest. In the oil industry\u2019s case, surviving companies were forced to integrate fiscal discipline. While painful at the time, these sacrifices set the stage for the XOP to potentially recover.\nFundamentally, the winds favor XOP bulls. Domestic oil production is tempered, while OPEC continues to push for production cuts. Crude oil prices may rise from their multi-year lows, which would help make explorers profitable.\nCombined with the aforementioned fiscal discipline, opportunities like the XOP suddenly look much more attractive to investors.\nBest ETFs to Buy for 2018: Fidelity MSCI Health Care Index ETF (FHLC)\nSource: Shutterstock\nHealthcare is a politically-charged topic so I\u2019ll try to be careful here. Universal healthcare is akin to the old adage, \u201cthere\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch.\u201d Somebody always pays. Under Obamacare, premiums soared. Under Trumpcare, who knows? Currently, Washington resembles a loony bin more so than the heart of American power. Nothing seems to be getting done.\nHowever, one thing I do know about President Trump is his pro-business stance. He wants to run America like a well-oiled machine. Primarily, this means investing in productive assets and cutting out the fat. To further the analogy, government bureaucracies like the FDA are downright obese. According to a CNN report, Trump was deeply troubled about how slow potentially life-saving drugs enter the market.\nHis compassion spells bigly profits for the Fidelity MSCI Health Care Index ETF (NYSEARCA:FHLC). A more efficient medical regulatory process should translate to higher revenues for pharmaceuticals. Additionally, medical equipment companies can take their products to market faster than before. Irrespective of whatever happens to the insurance front, the FHLC wins.\nAnother bullish factor is the fund\u2019s diverse portfolio. The FHLC is evenly balanced among pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and medical equipment makers. Moreover, the FHLC holds 345 stocks, providing greater coverage than rival ETFs.\nBest ETFs to Buy for 2018: iShares MSCI Canada Index (ETF) (EWC)\nSource: Shutterstock\nWith all the chaos that\u2019s occurring in our country and in our political system, it\u2019s nice to find stability. For many investors, that might come in the form of the iShares MSCI Canada Index (ETF) (NYSEARCA:EWC). While all nations have problems, Canada doesn\u2019t have anywhere near our level of divisiveness and crudity.\nBut politics aside, resource-rich Canada, and by logical extension the EWC, should find plenty of opportunities under the Trump administration. For starters, the President can use all the allies he can get. More importantly, the White House\u2019s stance on the environment, or lack thereof, opens the door to robust energy deals. I think we can all agree that getting our oil from Canada is a more palatable proposition than other sources.\nLastly, our benchmark SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) has been on an incredible run. However, all good things must come to an end.\nAlthough I\u2019m not trying to call tops, I will say that the longer our bull market lasts, the greater the probability of a correction. Investing a portion of your capital in the EWC fund helps mitigate some of that risk.\nAs of this writing, Josh Enomoto owned positions in SNE, gold, silver, platinum, palladium, bitcoin, and ethereum.",

        "full_text": "By Susan Taylor and Zandi Shabalala\nTORONTO/LONDON (Reuters) - Barrick Gold Corp <ABX.TO>, soon to become the world's largest bullion miner, is interested in adding more copper assets as long as the red metal is accompanied by bullion, executives said on Friday.\nBarrick, which expects to complete its $6.1 billion takeover of Randgold Resources <RRS.L> Jan. 1, outlined plans for exploration, expansion, streamlining and asset sales at an investor presentation in London.\nStructured under regions in North America, South America and Africa and the Middle East, Barrick spent the last four days focusing on where to take the merged company, said Randgold Chief Executive Officer Mark Bristow, who will be Barrick's new CEO.\nBarrick is open to copper assets \"as long as that copper is a component or co-product to the gold,\" said Rod Quick, who heads Randgold's projects and evaluation and will do the same in the merged company. \"Or, unless that copper project will enhance our strategic partner network.\"\nIn Africa, Barrick is open to exploiting its \"substantial footprint\" in the Democratic Republic of Congo to acquire world-class deposits, said Willem Jacobs, who heads Randgold's operations in central and east Africa and becomes Chief Operating Officer of Barrick's Africa and Middle East region.\nIn Zambia, Barrick aims to lower costs at its \"relatively low-grade\" Lumwana copper mine, he added, noting the country's new mining code stands to materially affect margins.\nBarrick said it is keen on exploration outside its operating base, flagging South America's Guyana Shield, which crosses Suriname, Guyana and French Guyana. It also wants more exposure in Canada.\nRob Krcmarov, executive vice president of exploration, said Barrick is interested in \"copper opportunities\" within its operating regions that meet investment criteria.\nTo approve projects with potential for more than 5 million ounces of gold, Barrick will require a 15-percent rate of return, based on a $1,000 gold price, said Quick. Projects with more than 3 million ounces of gold, need a 20-percent return.\nBarrick expects stronger operating cash flows, non-core asset sales and lower overhead and interest costs will help it increase future dividends, said Randgold Chief Financial Officer Graham Shuttleworth, who takes the same role at Barrick.\nTalks are underway to sell Barrick's Lagunas Norte mine, said Mark Hill, COO of Latin America. Barrick said in August the Peru mine was an example of the non-core mines it would look at selling. Reuters reported last year that Barrick was exploring options, including the sale of all or part of, Lagunas Norte.\n(Reporting by Susan Taylor in Toronto and Zandi Shabalala in London; Editing by Richard Chang and Grant McCool)",

Mineralization in this zone lies between 16 to 40 feet above the new main haulage way, which skirts the northern edge of the zone.\nProcessing of stockpiled material continue as well extending the haulage way access into the most westerly area of the mine workings to extract higher grade material. In addition, the Company is evaluating several processing and treatment alternatives to upgrade material with the objective of selling the upgraded material to start generating revenue. Further updates on its operating objectives will be provided as results are obtained.\nExpressions of interest, on favourable terms, have been received from several parties to acquire any direct shipping material the Company may produce. Discussions are continuing.\nOperations\nTo date, the Company has been working through stockpiled development material for further processing through the Company's ore-sorter.\nAssay results on ore-sorter product and reject materials show that the ore sorter typically upgrades the silver in andesite and rhyolite host rock by a factor of 5 times.\nThe Company has identified a new type of silver mineralization in a rhyolite host rock, north of the historic workings, which the ore-sorter has upgraded by as much as 25 times.\nThe Company is processing and stockpiling lower grade milling material that will require upgrading to a direct shipping grade of 100 oz/t (3,100 g/t) silver or better through either flotation or leaching.\nExcellent silver recoveries of greater than 90% have been reported to the Company by Metals US of Missoula, Montana who have provided their preliminary leaching test results on mineralization with a head grade of 15.7 oz/t silver and have reported silver recoveries of greater than 90%. Final results from those tests are anticipated within 2 weeks that will determine whether a flotation or leaching process is most cost effective for the milling grade material.\nStockpiled development material continues to be processed through the ore-sorter. Additionally the Company expects to continue stockpiling the ore-sorter upgraded milling grade material until sufficient tonnage has been accumulated for bulk processing.\nThe Company is upgrading by gravity methods the 800 plus tons of fines created by blasting and mining that are too small to be sorted through the ore-sorter.\nMining and Exploration\nSilver King Mines during its 1984 mining program, extended the mineralized zones an additional 300 feet to the west beyond the Big Dog Zone. The Company has currently extended the new haulage way an additional 150 feet further west into this area. This Westerly Zone forms part of the Company's suggested exploration target extending for a distance of over 1,000 feet containing between 500,000 - 1,000,000 tons grading between 17 - 20 oz silver per ton.\nThis potential exploration target is conceptual in nature. There has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target being delineated as a mineral resource. The Company advises that it does not have current mineral resources or mineral reserves for its Bayhorse Silver Mine property.\nThe Company advises it is not basing any decision to mine or produce on a feasibility study of mineral reserves demonstrating economic and technical viability and also advises there is increased uncertainty and specific economic and technical risks of failure associated with any such mining or production decision and it is not basing any decision to mine or produce on these historical estimates.\nIn light of weak silver and gold prices, as well as the recent trading halt caused by an unauthorized news release, the Company's share price has been under significant pressure. Therefore, the Company has elected to close its previously announced 18 cent financing. The Company's CEO, Graeme O'Neill, has sold shares in arranged sales both privately and through the facilities of the TSX Venture Exchange to participate in the current financing. These sales of free trading shares and their replacement with mandatory hold period shares are known in the industry as \"gypsy swaps\" and offer liquidity without significant dilution.\nThe Company has engaged Apex Geoscience and Dr. G. E. Ray, P.Geol, to conduct a NI 43-101 technical report on the Bayhorse Silver Mine and will file it on SEDAR in due course. An underground drilling program will accompany the preparation of the report.\nThis press release has been prepared under the supervision of and has been approved by Dr. Clay Conway, P.Geo., a Qualified Person under National Instrument 43-101and a Director of the Company.\nThis News Release has been prepared on behalf of the Bayhorse Silver Inc. Board of Directors, which accepts full responsibility for its contents.\nOn Behalf of the Board.\nGraeme O'Neill, CEO 604-684-3394\nBayhorse Silver Inc., a junior exploration company, has earned a 100% interest in the historic Bayhorse Silver Mine, Oregon, USA. The Company has an experienced management and technical team with extensive exploration and mining expertise.\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.",

There are signs that despite weaker gold and B2Gold rallying by 10% over the last month that there is further upside ahead for the miner.\nNow what?\nB2Gold reported some solid second quarter results that underscore the significant improvements made to its operations. Compared to a year earlier, gold production almost doubled to 240,000 ounces, a quarterly record that can be attributed to strong performances from the Fekola, Masbate and Otjikoto mines. It is the Fekola mine that was the key driver of this solid performance, as over the quarter it operated above plan producing 112,644 ounces of gold, which was 11% greater than forecast.\nFekola is proving to be an impressive asset to own. It has reserves of almost 3 million gold ounces with a notable average grade of 2.35 gram of gold per ton of ore, which is quite impressive for an open pit mine. Because of that high ore grade, Fekola has low operating costs that saw it report second quarter all-in sustaining costs (AISCs) of US$445 per gold ounce produced.\nAnd this, in conjunction with reduced costs at other operational mines, saw B2Gold reported some exceptional consolidated second quarter AISCs of US$721 per ounce of gold produced. These are some of the lowest among senior gold miners and were a notable 26% lower than a year earlier and 17% below budget.\nThat highlights the profitability of B2Gold\u2019s operations even amid an environment in which gold is softening and has drifted below the all-important US$1,200 an ounce mark.\nBecause of B2Gold\u2019s strong second quarter operational performance, the miner reported that cash flow from operating activities almost doubled compared to a year earlier and that net income shot-up by 11% year over year to US$21 million. This solid improvement in its financial performance compared to the equivalent quarter in 2017 was achieved because of the significant increase in production, reduced costs, and a 3% year over year increase in the average realized sale price to US$1,290 per gold ounce sold.\nHowever, weaker gold poses a threat to many gold miners because most have based their reserve calculations on US$1,200 an ounce or higher. Furthermore, analysts estimate that the industry wide marginal cost of production is only slightly lower at around US$1,080 an ounce.",

This is a rolling 10-year average of the price-to-earnings ratio on the S&P 500.\nImage source: Robert Shiller. Chart by author.\nWhat's fueling stocks right now?\nStocks have been higher than they are right now only twice in the past. The first time was in 1929 and the second time was in 1999, both of which were followed by steep corrections.\nThis doesn't necessarily mean we're in bubble territory, as there are good reasons stock prices are historically high. Interest rates are low, for example, which makes stocks more attractive than low-yielding bonds, thereby causing money to flood from the fixed-income markets into the stock market.\nThere have also been a number of important catalysts over the past year and a half that have pushed stocks higher. The presidential election was the big one, as then-candidate Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to cut the corporate tax rate from 35% down to 15%.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nLike lower interest rates, low taxes contribute directly to stock valuations. That's because stocks tend to be valued as a multiple of earnings. Therefore, because earnings will improve if taxes are cut, stock valuations were primed to climb, as they obviously have.\nAnd it isn't just stock valuations that are high. Farmland is also selling at a historically dear price. As is commercial real estate. And, of course, bitcoin prices have gone through the roof this year.\nData source: U.S. Department of Agriculture. Chart by author.\nThis seems to dim the prospects for future returns. If valuations today are high as a result of low interest rates, doesn't that mean they'll drop when interest rates climb?\nThat is a reasonable concern that investors should keep in mind when they buy stocks today. In my opinion, this would lead investors in at least two directions.\nBanks and interest rates\nThe first direction is to invest in companies that will benefit from higher interest rates. Banks offer a case in point.\nWhen a bank makes a loan, it's essentially selling money. The price at which it does so is the interest rate. So as rates rise, so, too, will the price of money. And as the price of money rises, so too should bank revenues.\nIn JPMorgan Chase's (NYSE: JPM) case, the nation's biggest bank by assets estimates that a 100-basis-point increase in both short- and long-term rates will translate into $1.9 billion in added net interest income, a component of revenue. \"The firm's sensitivity to rates is largely a result of assets repricing at a faster pace than deposits,\" notes JPMorgan Chase's latest quarterly regulatory filing.\nThe impact of higher rates will be even bigger for Citigroup(NYSE: C). It estimates that the same 100-basis-point increase in interest rates will produce $2.1 billion in additional net interest income each year on an ongoing basis. Though Citigroup's interest rate sensitivity analysis also illustrates the downside to higher rates, as the bank would suffer a one-time $4.2 billion writedown of assets that are inversely correlated in value to interest rates.\nAmong large banks, however, Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) would benefit the most, given how asset sensitive its balance sheet is. Under the same scenario as above, Bank of America would see its net interest income grow by $3.2 billion if rates rise 100 basis points on both the short and the long end of the yield curve.\nHedge against a drop in the market\nAnother direction investors could go in is to invest in securities that act as a natural hedge against a correction in the market. This isn't to say a correction will happen anytime soon, though the head of JPMorgan Chase's investment bank recently suggested that it could, but it is to say that it shouldn't come as a surprise given the height of the market today.\nThe assets that seem best positioned to serve as an effective hedge against a stock market correction are companies with exposure to precious metals, especially gold. The most direct way to get this exposure, aside from buying actually buying bullion, is to invest in the SPDR Gold Trust(NYSEMKT: GLD), which owns gold bars. A less direct, but more leveraged, way to get gold exposure is by buying shares of gold miners such as Yamana Gold(NYSE: AUY) or Barrick Gold(NYSE: ABX).\nWhile stocks tend to fall in the face of heightened risk and uncertainty, the price of gold tends to rise. We saw this in the mild correction at the beginning of 2016. At the same time that stocks dropped approximately 10% in January 2016, the price of gold soared more than 15%.\nIt's for this reason that Ray Dalio, the chairman and chief investment officer of Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund, has urged investors this year to think about allocating 5% to 10% of their portfolios to gold. There's no guarantee that the market will correct, of course, but if it does then you'll be happy you followed Dalio's advice.\nWhich of these three options you choose -- SPDR Gold Trust, Barrick Gold, or Yamana Gold -- is a function of risk and return. The SPDR Gold Trust offers the least risk as well as the lowest expected return of the three. Barrick Gold, the larger of the miners here, would be higher in terms of risk and prospective return. And Yamana Gold, the smaller miner of the two, would offer the greatest risk/return potential.\nJohn Maxfield owns shares of Bank of America and Yamana Gold.

The first key level on the charts today is $1272.30, followed by previous bottoms at $1268.10 and $1267.00. Given the recent price action, I think buyers are going to have to take out $1312.70 before investors will trust this market on the upside.\nAnd why would anyone trust a rally in gold right now with the U.S. set to raise rates later this month and perhaps as many as three times in 2018. Additionally, money continues to pore into U.S. equity markets, helped by the possibility that U.S. tax reform will become law later this week, or sometime before Christmas.\nEven another ballistic test by the North Koreans couldn\u2019t encourage investors to buy the precious metal in a major way last week. We did see some movement to the upside on Friday when Michael Flynn, a previous ally of President Trump pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. This news drove stocks sharply lower, underpinning gold prices.\nThis tells me that the only way gold is going to make any meaningful rally over the near-term is if there is a major sell-off in the stock market.

Gold production and costs for the quarter were in line with expectations, with earnings and cash flow impacted by planned maintenance activities at Barrick Nevada and Pueblo Viejo. The Company remains on track to meet full-year gold production guidance, with higher production and lower costs expected in the second half of 2018.\nOur Nevada growth projects at Cortez, Goldrush, and Turquoise Ridge continued to advance according to schedule and within budget, underpinning the next generation of profitable production from this core region for Barrick. In addition, our pipeline continues to grow with the announcement today of a new, high grade gold discovery at Fourmile, located just two kilometers north of the Goldrush project in Nevada. This discovery demonstrates the significant untapped geological potential of Barrick's properties in Nevada, where the Company is evaluating a project to increase processing capacity in order to accommodate new production from organic projects, and bring forward production from stockpiles. Prefeasibility level studies in support of a plant expansion at the Pueblo Viejo mine in the Dominican Republic are also advancing, with a pilot heap leach pad now in operation at the site.\nPartnerships form a core element of our strategy to drive long-term value. On July 9, Barrick and Shandong Gold Group signed an enhanced strategic cooperation agreement, reflecting Barrick's unique focus on creating distinctive, enduring, and trust-based relationships with China and China's best companies, as we jointly explore opportunities to enhance long-term value for our respective owners, and for our government and community partners. Under the agreement, Shandong is currently completing an independent evaluation focused on the potential to develop a mining project at Lama in Argentina, including a high-level evaluation of potential synergies between Lama and the nearby Veladero operation.\nOUTLOOK\nOur 2018 consolidated gold production guidance remains unchanged at 4.5-5.0 million ounces, at a cost of sales3 of $810-$850 per ounce, cash costs4 of $540-$575 per ounce, and all-in sustaining costs4 of $765-$815 per ounce.\nWe expect gold production and costs to improve steadily over the second half of the year, driven by stronger performance at Barrick Nevada and Pueblo Viejo. Gold production in the third quarter is anticipated to be around 1.2 million ounces.\nAt Barrick Nevada, throughput and grade is expected to improve due to the completion of scheduled maintenance shutdowns in the first half of the year, as well as increased production from the Cortez Hills open pit. At Pueblo Viejo, we expect an increase in quarter-over-quarter production as we transition to higher grades in Phase Five and Six of the Moore Pit. Third quarter throughput is expected to remain in line with the second quarter as we complete the second of two scheduled autoclave maintenance shutdowns for the year. We anticipate higher grades at Pueblo Viejo to persist into the fourth quarter, with higher throughput. Full processing capacity has also been restored at the Porgera Joint Venture earlier than initially expected, following the earthquake that struck Papua New Guinea in late February.\nWe expect to produce 345-410 million pounds of copper in 2018 at a cost of sales3 of $2.00-$2.30 per pound, C1 cash costs5 of $1.80-$2.00 per pound, and all-in sustaining costs5 of $2.55-$2.85 per pound. Copper production is anticipated to improve progressively over the third and fourth quarters, driven by a steady improvement in grade and crusher reliability at Lumwana, as well as an optimization of stacking procedures at Zald\u00edvar.\nTotal attributable capital expenditure guidance6 for 2018 remains unchanged at $1.40-$1.60 billion, including mine site sustaining capital7 of $0.95-$1.10 billion, and project capital expenditures8 of $450-$550 million.\nWe are adjusting our 2018 effective income tax rate guidance to 44-46 percent, compared to our initial guidance of 41-43 percent, reflecting lower spot gold prices and sales mix.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nThe Company reported a net loss of $94 million ($0.08 per share) in the second quarter and adjusted net earnings1 of $81 million ($0.07 per share). Operating cash flow was $141 million. Lower adjusted net earnings and operating cash flow compared to the prior-year period primarily reflect the impact of lower gold sales. In addition, while total direct mining costs were in line with the prior-year period, direct mining costs on a per ounce basis increased, primarily due to the impact of fewer ounces sold, as well as expenses associated with planned maintenance at the Barrick Nevada roaster and the Pueblo Viejo autoclaves, and higher fuel costs. This was partially offset by higher realized gold prices9, lower income tax expense, and lower depreciation as a result of lower sales volumes. While income tax expenses were lower than the prior-year period, our second quarter effective tax rate increased from 46 percent in 2017 to 48 percent in 2018, bringing our 2018 year-to-date effective tax rate to 44 percent.\nSignificant adjusting items impacting net earnings in the second quarter of 2018 included (pre-tax and non-controlling interest effects):\n- $75 million in foreign currency translation losses primarily related to the significant weakening of the Argentinean peso;\n- $59 million in net impairment charges primarily related to the Kabanga project (a joint venture between Barrick and Glencore) and Acacia's Nyanzaga project; and\n- $43 million in other expense adjustments, including $28 million relating to staffing reductions and office closures associated with the implementation of our decentralized operating model.\nDuring the second quarter of 2018, we implemented a number of organizational reductions to advance the implementation of our decentralized operating model. We completed an extensive review of all positions sitting above operations, reallocating roles where appropriate, eliminating those no longer required and closing a number of smaller offices. We are maintaining our full-year general and administrative expense guidance, as the expected savings from these changes are offset by approximately $30 million of severance expense.\nRefer to page 48 for a full list of reconciling items between net earnings and adjusted net earnings for the current and prior-year periods.\nThe Company recorded negative free cash flow2 of $172 million in the second quarter, driven by lower operating cash flows as described above. This was partially offset by lower capital expenditures compared to the prior-year period.\nBALANCE SHEET UPDATE\nAt the end of the second quarter, the Company had a consolidated cash balance of approximately $2.1 billion10. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, Barrick completed a make-whole repurchase of the outstanding principal of approximately $629 million on the Company's 4.40 percent notes due in 2021. As result, our total debt has been reduced from approximately $6.4 billion to $5.8 billion, further strengthening the Company's balance sheet. Over the past five years, Barrick has reduced its total debt by $10 billion.\nFollowing this repayment, the Company has less than $100 million in debt due before 202011, and more than 85 percent of our outstanding debt matures after 2032.\nOPERATING HIGHLIGHTS\nBarrick produced 1.07 million ounces of gold in the second quarter of 2018 at a cost of sales3 of $882 per ounce, all-in sustaining costs4 of $856 per ounce, and cash costs4 of $605 per ounce, in line with expectations. Gold production in the second quarter was impacted by lower grade and recovery at the Barrick Nevada oxide mill, and scheduled maintenance shutdowns at the Barrick Nevada roaster and the Pueblo Viejo autoclaves. Both shutdowns were successfully optimized, reflecting the Company's focus on increasing the overall availability of our processing facilities by consolidating work and extending the time between planned maintenance activities.\nSecond quarter production at the Porgera Joint Venture was impacted by a significant earthquake that occurred in late February, resulting in a change to the mine's full-year guidance. However, full processing capacity has been restored at the mine, earlier than initially anticipated. A rock fall at the Kalgoorlie open pit in mid-May also impacted production in the second quarter, with lower mining rates expected for the remainder of the year.\nDuring the second quarter, the Turquoise Ridge mine implemented a more efficient system for the shipping of ore for processing. Previously, ore was stockpiled on site before being shipped to Newmont's Twin Creeks facility for processing. Ore will now be shipped directly to Twin Creeks, eliminating double handling of the material. This change will eliminate one month of stockpiled material in 2018, resulting in a one-time change in inventory that will increase costs this year.\nOn a per ounce basis, cost of sales applicable to gold3 was higher than the prior-year period primarily due to the impact of fewer ounces sold. Direct mining costs on a per ounce basis also increased, primarily due to the impact of fewer ounces sold, costs associated with planned maintenance at the Barrick Nevada roaster and the Pueblo Viejo autoclaves, and higher fuel costs. Higher all-in sustaining costs4 compared to the prior-year period primarily reflect the impact of higher direct mining costs on a per ounce basis, as described above.\nThe Company produced 83 million pounds of copper in the second quarter, at a cost of sales3 of $2.45 per pound, all-in sustaining costs5 of $3.04 per pound, and C1 cash costs5 of $2.10 per pound. Lower copper production in the second quarter was primarily the result of unplanned downtime at the Lumwana crusher, and fewer heap leach tonnes processed at Zald\u00edvar, partially offset by an increase in production at Jabal Sayid.\nOn a per pound basis, cost of sales applicable to copper3 increased primarily due to higher processing and maintenance costs at Lumwana, and higher unit production costs as a result of lower sales at Zald\u00edvar. Higher all-in sustaining costs primarily reflected higher direct mining costs applicable to copper.\nPlease see page 35 of Barrick's second quarter MD&A for individual operating segment performance details.

Located approximately two kilometers north of Goldrush in Nevada, drilling continues to intersect high grade results, confirming the continuity of mineralization in the project area, and increasing our confidence that Fourmile and Goldrush form part of a seven-kilometer-long mineralized system. Recent drilling has encountered high grade mineralization across a number of stratigraphic horizons in multiple holes covering an area 600 meters in length by 200 meters in width.\nAssay result highlights from the second quarter include 13.9 meters grading 56.8 grams per tonne of gold, 16.6 meters grading 71.6 grams per tonne of gold, and 16.8 meters grading 57.9 grams per tonne of gold. Please see endnote 13 for a significant intercepts table including recent Fourmile drilling.\nBased on the success of our 2018 drilling campaign to date, we are allocating an additional $10 million to Fourmile exploration this year, increasing the total number of planned holes from 30 to 47. Further infill and wide spaced step out drilling will continue for the remainder of 2018.\nTurquoise Ridge (75 percent Barrick)14 - Shaft sinking contractor mobilizing on site, high grade exploration results extend deposit\nBarrick is constructing a third shaft at Turquoise Ridge, which will allow the mine to roughly double annual production to more than 500,000 ounces per year (100 percent basis), at an average cost of sales3 of around $720 per ounce, and average all-in sustaining costs4 of roughly $630 per ounce. Thyssen Mining, the shaft sinking contractor, is now mobilizing on site. Dewatering is advancing according to plan, and construction of surface infrastructure for electrical distribution and other mine utilities is well advanced. The capital cost for this project is estimated to be $300-$325 million (100 percent basis). Initial production from the new shaft is expected to begin in 2022, with sustained production from 2023.\nAt the end of 2017, Turquoise Ridge had 5.9 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves15 (Barrick's 75 percent share), at an average grade of 15.5 grams per tonne\u2014the highest reserve grade in the Company's operating portfolio, and among the highest in the gold industry. The mine added 2.1 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves in 2017 through drilling (Barrick's 75 percent share), and the deposit remains open in multiple directions, including at depth.\nMine exploration drilling at Turquoise Ridge in 2018 has continued to expand the deposit in multiple directions. The North Zone Getchell program is targeting an open area of the Getchell Fault up-dip in the northwest portion of the mine. The first hole of the program intersected 16.5 meters at 15.3 grams per tonne of gold. This intercept extends mineralization along the fault by 120 meters, with further drilling planned along the same structure.\nIn 2017, exploration drilling discovered mineralization 180 meters northeast of the deposit as part of the Foot Wall Pond Extension program. So far this year, drilling has extended known mineralization to the northeast by another 120 meters, with an intercept of 6.7 meters grading 13.9 grams per tonne gold. Follow-up drilling will also continue in this area.\nGoldrush - Decline development commenced\nWhen in full operation, the Goldrush underground project is expected to produce approximately 500,000 ounces of gold per year, at a cost of sales3 of roughly $750 per ounce, and all-in sustaining costs4 of approximately $640 per ounce. Portal pad construction for the twin declines was completed in the first quarter of 2018, and initial decline development commenced in the second quarter. Decline construction is expected to accelerate following the mobilization of the decline development contractor during the third quarter. Exploration twin declines will provide access to the orebody at depth, which will enable further drilling, as well as the conversion of existing resources to reserves. These declines can be converted into production declines in the future. Goldrush currently has proven and probable gold reserves of 1.5 million ounces15, and measured and indicated gold resources of 9.4 million ounces15, with significant potential to identify additional resources once underground access to drill the deposit is established.\nCortez Deep South16 - East decline complete, west decline advancing\nThe Deep South project is expected to contribute approximately 300,000 ounces of annual gold production when fully ramped up between 2024 and 2028, at a cost of sales3 of $650 per ounce, and all-in sustaining costs4 of $580 per ounce. Deep South will utilize infrastructure which has already been approved under current plans to expand mining in the Lower Zone of the Cortez underground mine, including the new Rangefront twin declines and other underground infrastructure already under construction. During the second quarter, west decline development and mass excavations in support of the project continued to advance. Initial production from Deep South is expected in 2022.\nDOMINICAN REPUBLIC\nPueblo Viejo (60 percent Barrick) - Pre-oxidation heap leach and pilot flotation plant civil works underway\nBarrick is advancing prefeasibility level studies for a plant expansion at the Pueblo Viejo mine that would increase throughput by 50 percent to 12 million tonnes per year, allowing the mine to maintain average annual gold production of 800,000 ounces after 2022 (100 percent basis). The project involves the addition of a pre-oxidation heap leach pad with a capacity of eight million tonnes per year, a new mill and flotation concentrator with a capacity of four million tonnes per year, and additional tailings capacity. The project has the potential to convert roughly seven million ounces of measured and indicated resources to proven and probable reserves (100 percent basis).15\nIn support of the prefeasibility study, we have completed the construction of a pilot pre-oxidation heap leach pad to test metallurgy and recoveries, and are now irrigating ore. Civil works for the pilot flotation circuit have also commenced, and a tender process for structural, mechanical, and electrical contracts is now underway.\nENHANCED STRATEGIC COOPERATION AGREEMENT WITH SHANDONG GOLD\nEarlier this month, Barrick announced that it had entered into an enhanced strategic cooperation agreement with Shandong Gold Group Co., Ltd., deepening Barrick's partnership with one of China's leading mining companies. Key elements of the enhanced strategic cooperation agreement include:\n- Lama Evaluation\nShandong Gold will carry out an independent evaluation of the potential to develop a mining project at Lama in Argentina, including a high-level evaluation of potential synergies between Lama and the nearby Veladero operation. Following the completion of this study, Barrick and Shandong may agree to conduct additional studies and technical work to evaluate a number of development options. Any decision by Shandong to invest in the project would be subject to additional agreement between the Parties.\n- Strengthening Collaboration Between Barrick and Shandong Teams\nReflecting a mutual commitment to operational excellence, safety, efficiency, and best-in-class mining practices, Barrick and Shandong have agreed to choose one of Shandong's mines to serve as a platform for learning and collaboration between the two companies. Barrick and Shandong have also agreed to establish additional mechanisms to foster greater communication and knowledge-sharing between respective management and technical teams.\n- Strengthening Cooperation on Investment Opportunities\nBuilding on a prior agreement to evaluate joint investment in organic mining projects currently owned by Barrick and Shandong, the two companies have agreed to consider opportunities to work together on acquisition opportunities or potential asset sales, if both agree it is in their collective best interests, and would enhance the value of such an opportunity.\nHEMLO ROYALTY ACQUISITION\nBarrick has acquired a 2.5 percent gross revenue royalty for $14.9 million on certain surface and mineral lands adjacent to the Hemlo property in Ontario that was originally granted to Newmont Mining Corporation as part of the land acquisition in 2015. The royalty covers approximately 37 percent of Barrick's overall land holding at Hemlo and includes large, highly prospective areas immediately west of the current operation. Drilling up to 800 meters beyond the limits of the existing resource has partly validated that ore grade mineralization is continuous. The area covered by the royalty could represent potentially significant mine life extensions.\nTECHNICAL INFORMATION\nThe scientific and technical information contained in this press release has been reviewed and approved by: Geoffrey Locke, P.

Barrick believes this to be a useful indicator of our ability to operate without reliance on additional borrowing or usage of existing cash. Free cash flow is intended to provide additional information only and does not have any standardized meaning under IFRS and may not be comparable to similar measures of performance presented by other companies. Free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.

Cost of sales applicable to copper per pound is calculated using cost of sales applicable to copper including our proportionate share of cost of sales attributable to equity method investments (Zald\u00edvar and Jabal Sayid), divided by consolidated copper pounds (including our proportionate share of copper pounds from our equity method investments).\nEndnote 4\n\u201cCash costs\u201d per ounce and \u201cAll-in sustaining costs\u201d per ounce are non-GAAP financial performance measures. \u201cCash costs\u201d per ounce starts with cost of sales applicable to gold production, but excludes the impact of depreciation, the non-controlling interest of cost of sales, and includes by-product credits. \u201cAll-in sustaining costs\u201d per ounce begin with \u201cCash costs\u201d per ounce and add further costs which reflect the additional costs of operating a mine, primarily sustaining capital expenditures, general & administrative costs, minesite exploration and evaluation costs, and reclamation cost accretion and amortization. Barrick believes that the use of \u201ccash costs\u201d per ounce and \u201call-in sustaining costs\u201d per ounce will assist investors, analysts and other stakeholders in understanding the costs associated with producing gold, understanding the economics of gold mining, assessing our operating performance and also our ability to generate free cash flow from current operations and to generate free cash flow on an overall Company basis. \u201cCash costs\u201d per ounce and \u201cAll-in sustaining costs\u201d per ounce are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning under IFRS. Although a standardized definition of all-in sustaining costs was published in 2013 by the World Gold Council (a market development organization for the gold industry comprised of and funded by 24 gold mining companies from around the world, including Barrick), it is not a regulatory organization, and other companies may calculate this measure differently. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS.

To break this level, it really needs big triggers,\" said Vandana Bharti, assistant vice president of commodity research at SMC Comtrade Ltd.\n\"It was a correction in the equity markets that provided the recent upside in gold. If equity markets tumble further, which we expect due to trade war and other issues, then we may see fresh buying in gold.\"\nAsia shares recouped early losses and crept higher as China made a fresh attempt to stabilise its stock markets, but the gains looked fragile.\nSpot gold may test a support at $1,217 per ounce, a break below which could cause a loss to the next support at $1,208, said Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.\nHoldings in SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, rose 0.7 percent to 24.27 million ounces on Monday, the highest in nearly two months.",

The Fed\u2019s dot plot projections will reveal if the central bank believes an overheating economy needs to be cooled off by more aggressive monetary policy.\nThe Gold prices are likely to break further if the Fed is hawkish in its tone. A dovish Fed could trigger a short-covering rally. However, keep in mind that investors are still concerned about a trade war, possible tariffs against China, elevated volatility and rising negative sentiment. These factors could limit gains or accelerate any sell-off.\nAs of Tuesday\u2019s close, futures market data from the CME Group shows the chances of rates going up more than three times this year is around 40%, compared with 25% a month ago.\nTraders will also get the opportunity to react to the U.S. Existing Home Sales report.

GLD has not felt the market wobble that began in late January, and since January 26 is only down 3% against a Dow drop of 7%.\nOf course, you can plot out graphs across any distance in time to prove almost anything. Consider the value of GLD over the last three years, compared to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTCMKTS:GBTC), a mutual fund tied to bitcoin. They\u2019re all within 1% of each other, and within 1% of even as well, although GBTC is far more volatile.\nGold does have advantages as a store of value. New supplies can be estimated accurately, as can demand for jewelry and electronics. It is fungible, and can be exchanged for any currency, or bartered directly for goods.\nBitcoin has many of these advantages. The total number of answers to the bitcoin puzzle is limited. Given that it exists only in a computer, it is highly transportable, and can be exchanged for any currency. It can also be bartered for goods.\nBut that doesn\u2019t make bitcoin money. That makes bitcoin a commodity, one with a total market cap of $159 billion as of May 10. The world\u2019s gold supply is worth over $7 trillion.\nWhat Makes Gold Useful\nWhat makes gold useful today is that $7 trillion market size, which is half the market cap of the NASDAQ. But gold is also like Roman Numerals, unwieldy and limited. The largest Roman Numeral was M for 1,000, so once numbers got serious they also got impossible. The same thing happens if you try to travel with, say, 50 pounds of gold in your pocket.",

That should create a headwind for investors.\"\nHigher interest rates usually push gold lower because they raise bond yields, reducing the appeal of non-yielding bullion, and boost the dollar, making gold more expensive for holders of other currencies.\n\"If the tax proposal were to fail, there would be some reason to think there's political risk at that point because it would take the market by surprise, and that would provide some support for gold,\" Haworth added.\nTop U.S. Republicans expect Congress to pass the bill this week, with votes in the House of Representatives and Senate as early as Tuesday.\nA final bout of dollar strength could hit gold into 2018, sending prices down $25 to $50, but then it should recover, said analyst Carsten Menke of Julius Baer in Zurich.\nIn other precious metals, platinum reached a 1-1/2-week high.\n\"Platinum was trending significantly lower, got a little oversold and right now, it's covering of short positions,\" a New York-based trader said.\nHaving risen 1.7 percent during the last session, platinum is on track for its biggest two-day rally since January.\nPrices of the metal have increased in January and February over the past 15 years due to maintenance shutdowns in South Africa, which accounts for 70 percent of platinum, Menke added.\nSilver <XAG=> was up 0.4 percent at $16.12 an ounce after rising to a nearly two-week high of $16.17.",

        "full_text": "Tax Party: Weekend Senate Vote Paves Way For Optimism About Possible Cuts\nJJ Kinahan\nStocks looked poised to leap out of the starting gate Monday as enthusiasm built about possible tax cuts after the Senate\u2019s weekend vote. There\u2019s a lot of hope that if corporate taxes go down, earnings could improve next year and give stocks an additional tailwind.\nDow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) futures charged up more than 200 points before Monday\u2019s opening bell following an amazing comeback stock indices had Friday. There\u2019s a definite positive response to the Senate\u2019s passage of tax legislation early Saturday, though the two houses of Congress still have to find a way to work through differences between the House and Senate versions. Republicans say they want to get this all finished before Christmas.\nTax reform is just one component of the Washington watch in coming days. Congress also has to find a way to keep the government running, a debate that could pick up steam as the week advances. At this point, the government is funded through Friday, but Congress has to take action to keep agencies going after that. Failure to do that would likely mean what we\u2019ve seen in past government shutdowns, including national parks closing and many federal employees not coming to work. Also, it might mean delays in economic data for Wall Street.\nHowever, all that remains a worst-case scenario, and Republican congressional leaders said over the weekend that a shutdown isn\u2019t happening. The hope is that the Senate getting taxes done could help with momentum in avoiding a government shutdown. However, keep an eye on volatility this week if there\u2019s any sign of problems on this issue.\nVolatility spiked Friday after what turned out to be an erroneous news report about the Russian investigation, but quickly settled down. VIX remains above 11, which is on the high side for this year but low historically.\nBelieve it or not, there are things besides Washington to think about as well. Investors face a full slate of economic data \u2014 including payrolls \u2014 this week as they get ready for the Fed meeting later this month.\nWhile Friday\u2019s November payrolls report arguably stands head and shoulders above all the other economic reports, the new week also brings factory orders, a look at the U.S. trade balance, and ISM services data. This all comes after the final week of November yielded a full basket of robust numbers, including Chicago PMI, new home sales, construction spending, and the ISM manufacturing index. All of these came in above Wall Street analysts\u2019 expectations, helping solidify anticipation of another possible Fed rate hike later this month.\nPayrolls come out just a few days before the Fed meeting. If you think back to early November (seems like a long time ago), you might remember that October job creation totaled 261,000 after a weak September report that was dogged by hurricanes. In the past, job creation has sputtered immediately after a major storm and then made steady gains the following months. We\u2019ll see if that\u2019s the case again this time, though past performance can\u2019t predict the future.\nThe oil market might also draw some eyeballs in the days ahead to see if there\u2019s any more reaction to OPEC\u2019s decision to extend its production cuts through all of 2018. Front-month U.S. futures pushed through resistance at $58 a barrel on Friday, but the real mark to watch might be $60, a level that U.S. futures haven\u2019t reached since mid-2015. Oil lost a little ground early Monday amid talk that U.S. producers might keep ramping up output now that OPEC has acted.\nAs market volatility increased Friday, it looked like some investors began gravitating toward the more \u201cdefensive\u201d parts of the market. Both gold and U.S. Treasury bonds found buyers, though neither really took off in a major way. Gold prices remain in the same $1,200 to $1,300 an ounce range they\u2019ve been in most of the year, though at the upper end.\nMerger and acquisition news didn\u2019t take the weekend off, as Sunday brought word of CVS Health Corp (NYSE: CVS) agreeing to buy Aetna Inc (NYSE: AET) in a $69 billion deal. This potentially combines one of the biggest drug store companies with one of the biggest health insurers. There hasn\u2019t been a huge amount of M&A this year, but Investor\u2019s Business Daily recently pointed out that companies \u2014 especially those in the industrial sector \u2014 are sitting on an immense hoard of cash, so it\u2019s not out of the question that we might see more M&A in the weeks and months to come. Before the AET/CVS deal announcement, $1.2 trillion in M&A had been announced so far this year, down from $1.65 trillion last year and nearly $2 trillion the year before.\nAnother thing that\u2019s getting a lot of attention lately is bitcoin, and we haven\u2019t spent any time discussing it in this column. Here\u2019s something to keep in mind: What happens when a product like bitcoin goes to these high levels is that you get people trading who probably shouldn\u2019t be, and who might not understand it. If you can\u2019t define what the product is, you might want to be extra careful.\nFIGURE 1: ROLLER COASTER FRIDAY. The S&P 500 Index (SPX) had quite a wild ride Friday, as a mid-morning news report about former national security adviser Michael Flynn was followed a few hours later by a report the U.S. Senate had secured enough votes to pass its version of the tax bill. Data source: CME Group. Chart source: The thinkorswim\u00ae platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.\nWhere\u2019s the Competition?\nThough market volatility spiked last week as political battles raged in Washington, one thing that might have been revealed \u2014 and something we touched on recently \u2014 is that there still appears to be money on the sidelines that can get injected into stocks when there\u2019s good news. That looked to be the case Thursday when markets quickly rose 1% on hopes of a Senate vote on tax reform. With bond yields still low, there\u2019s not a lot of competition from other markets for investors\u2019 rain day funds. That said, stocks have come a long way this year, so investors should consider checking allocations and making sure they\u2019re comfortable with their percentages of equities vs. fixed income.\nHow Many Rate Hikes in 2018? Jury is Out\nOne question heading into the new week is whether investors have fully baked in the possibility of several more rate increases next year. At this point, that\u2019s debatable. The futures market predicts 90% odds of a Fed rate hike before year-end, and just about a 50% chance of another hike in March. Odds of an additional hike don\u2019t rise above 50% until September, futures prices indicate. Much of Wall Street is pricing in just three rate hikes next year, which would mean rates of between 1.75% and 2% by the end of 2018. However, some analysts are starting to pencil in a possible fourth hike. That\u2019s more in line with what the Fed itself has projected, according to its \u201cdot plot\u201d from September, and might be a reason bonds saw some selling pressure late last week. The Fed meeting next week could provide further insight.\nOne Possible Rally Explanation\nYou hear a lot of explanations for the recent stock market rally, including strong economic data, hopes for tax cuts, signs of a positive start to holiday shopping season, and high bond prices. Another thought is that some of the strength could be seasonal, and, if that\u2019s the case, it might point toward further gains in the coming weeks, though nothing is guaranteed. Here\u2019s how the seasonal factor might be playing out: Portfolio managers often want to show they were holding stocks that worked at the end of the year. That can sometimes lead to the \u201cwinners\u201d being pushed higher in the year\u2019s closing weeks. With this in mind, keep tabs on which sectors have been \u201cwinners\u201d so far this year to see if some of the end-of-the-year positioning gives them further support. Info tech is the leading sector with year-to-date gains of nearly 37%, followed by health care (21%), materials (19%) and consumer discretionary (18.5%).\nInformation from TDA is not intended to be investment advice or construed as a recommendation or endorsement of any particular investment or investment strategy, and is for illustrative purposes only.

China saying it would defend its interests, while the move drew strong criticism abroad and at home where U.S. business groups and members of his own Republican Party warned of damage to the industry and raised the prospect of a global trade war that would harm American interests.\nJapan's Nikkei (.N225) ended down 1.1 percent after Nissan, Mazda and Toyota all fell [.T].\nIn Europe, German carmakers Daimler (DAIGn.DE), BMW (BMWG.DE) and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) dropped 1.7 to 2.8 percent.\nGermany's benchmark DAX index (.GDAXI) fell 0.9 percent and Europe's autos sector (.SXAP) was the worst-performing, losing 1.8 percent.\nIn the currency markets, Turkey's lira remained the big mover. It weakened beyond 4.79 against the dollar, surrendering most of the gains made a day earlier after the Turkish central bank raised its key interest rate by 300 basis points to prop up the plunging currency. Investors appeared to bet another hike would be needed to relieve the selloff.\nAs the latest U.S.-North Korea concerns boosted investor appetite for low-risk debt, gold prices (XAU=) were propelled above $1,300 per ounce. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies (.DXY) and hit a two-week low against the Japanese yen (JPY=) on the news.\nU.S. Treasuries rallied in reaction to Trump's letter, with benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note yields falling to a session low of 2.97 percent.\nTreasuries also gained on political strife surrounding Italy's new eurosceptic, anti-austerity coalition.\nItaly\u2019s partners in the euro lined up in Brussels to urge the new government in Rome to stick to EU budget rules or risk following Greece into financial calamity that would hurt the whole of Europe.\nElsewhere, oil prices recorded their largest one-day drop in two weeks amid expectations OPEC could wind down an output deal that has been in place since the start of 2017 due to concerns about supplies from Venezuela and Iran.\nInternational benchmark Brent crude fell 1.3 percent to $78.77 a barrel and WTI U.S. crude (CLc1) fell 1.7 percent to $70.64.\n(Additional reporting by Marc Jones, April Joyner, Sruthi Shankar and Andrew Galbraith; Editing by Bernadette Baum and James Dalgleish)",

Drilling was conducted by Minera Antares Peru SAC, a wholly owned subsidiary of First Quantum Minerals Ltd whereby First Quantum can earn up to an 80% interest in Panteria by completing certain milestones and payments outlined in the Company's news release dated March 15, 2016. First Quantum received all necessary permits in August, 2017 and drilled a total of 4160 metres in six holes finishing early 2018.\nThe initial drill program focused on testing a conceptual buried-porphyry target over the main Panteria area. Results strongly re-inforce the property's potential that a large copper-gold porphyry system is present within the project area and the core of the system has yet to be located. Four of the six widely spaced holes intersected copper-gold mineralization associated with strong phyllic alteration (quartz-sericite-pyrite) often overprinting an earlier potassic alteration (secondary biotite). Copper-gold mineralization associated with the typical porphyry style alteration intersected shows that there is at least a 1300 metre horizontal extent of the mineralization and alteration in the sub-surface and over a 770 metre vertical extent.\nThe last drill hole of the program, PANDD_006 located between holes PANDD_002 and PANDD_004 (see maps below), intersected tourmaline healed and hydrothermal breccias returning 31.30 metres of 0.497% Cu and 0.676 g/t Au or 0.94 % copper equivalent (\"CuEq\") within a broader interval of 125.80 metres of 0.252% Cu and 0.283 g/t Au or 0.44 % CuEq. This type of mineralization and alteration suggests close proximity to the core of the porphyry system. A strong quartz stockwork system (A veins) was intersected in PANDD_004 and later overprinted or altered to an intermediate argillic (SCC) type alteration. This mineralization and alteration in PANDD_004 is located 400 metres north of the mineralization in PANDD_006 and possibly shows a different mineralized porphyry event.

No allowance is made for losses in a normal mining situation. The reported intercepts are not necessarily true widths, as there is insufficient data at this time to determine the orientation of the mineralized body.\nDiscussion of Results\nFirst Quantum's geologists note that multiple porphyry phases were intersected and alteration and mineralization styles present strongly suggest that drilling intersected the pyritic shell. Mineralized tourmaline healed breccias abundant in PANDD_006 also suggest the core of the porphyry is within close proximity. These alteration and breccia types are always peripheral in a porphyry system and further exploration is warranted. Furthermore, further drilling is required to test the conductive zones located to the west and northwest of the current drilling.\nTypical copper-gold porphyry systems generally have high grade cores showing strong potassic alteration with well developed quartz stockworks systems. The hydrothermal system present at Panteria is very extensive and well developed over a wide area. The core of the system is generally much smaller and always higher grade and has yet to be located. The company is extremely encouraged that there are many intervals of peripheral copper-gold mineralization returning copper equivalent values above 0.20 % CuEq.\nDuran's technical team has reviewed the core and is very pleased with the quality of the data. Shareholders and potential investors are encouraged to visit Duran's website to review the maps and photos of the core showing alteration types and their relative locations.\nFirst Quantum is expected to continue the drilling once the weather improves. Duran is very pleased with the social programs being implemented by First Quantum and the Company encourages shareholders and potential investors to review the videos provided by First Quantum regarding the social and technical work on the Company's website in the Panteria project section of Duran's website (www.duranventuresinc.com).\nAll diamond drilling has been performed using HQ-diameter drill rods, reducing to NQ diameter if required. All core was shipped to First Quantum's warehouse in Arequipa for logging and splitting. Samples were submitted for preparation at ALS Peru S.A's (\"ALS\") preparation centre in Arequipa and later analyzed at ALS's facilities in Lima, Peru. All samples were analyzed using multi-digestion with inductively coupled plasma finish and fire assay with atomic absorption finish for gold. Samples over 1 per cent copper were reanalyzed using four-acid digestion with an ore-grade ICP finish.\nJeffrey Reeder, P.Geo., and a qualified person as defined in National Instrument 43-101, has prepared, supervised the preparation, or approved the scientific and technical disclosure contained in this news release.\nMaps\nPanteria Project: Topographic Map and Drill Hole Traces\nDuran Ventures Inc. is a Canadian exploration company focused on mineral processing and the exploration and development of precious and base metal properties in Peru.\nDuran Ventures Inc. is a Canadian resource company Listed on the TSX Venture Exchange and the Bolsa de Valores de Lima: Symbol \"DRV\" For additional information, contact: Jeffrey Reeder Tel: (647) 302-3290 or Oscar Pezo at (011) 511 422-1467 Website: www.duranventuresinc.com Email: info@duranventuresinc.com\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nDisclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements: This press release contains certain \"Forward-Looking Statements\" within the meaning of applicable securities legislation.

[/FRX]\n\"If (the tax bill) were to pass, we think the gold price would fall lower,\" said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist for U.S. Bank Wealth Management. \"That has to do with stronger growth, more room for the Fed to normalise interest rates. That should create a headwind for investors.\"\nHigher interest rates usually push gold lower because they raise bond yields, reducing the appeal of non-yielding bullion, and boost the dollar, making gold more expensive for holders of other currencies.\n\"If the tax proposal were to fail, there would be some reason to think there's political risk at that point because it would take the market by surprise, and that would provide some support for gold,\" Haworth added.\nTop U.S. Republicans expect Congress to pass the bill this week, with votes in the House of Representatives and Senate as early as Tuesday.\nA final bout of dollar strength could hit gold into 2018, sending prices down $25 to $50, but then it should recover, said analyst Carsten Menke of Julius Baer in Zurich.\nIn other precious metals, platinum reached a 1-1/2-week high.\n\"Platinum was trending significantly lower, got a little oversold and right now, it's covering of short positions,\" a New York-based trader said.\nHaving risen 1.7 percent during the last session, platinum is on track for its biggest two-day rally since January.\nPrices of the metal have increased in January and February over the past 15 years due to maintenance shutdowns in South Africa, which accounts for 70 percent of platinum, Menke added.\nSilver (XAG=) was up 0.4 percent at $16.12 an ounce after rising to a nearly two-week high of $16.17.\nPalladium (XPD=) fell 0.6 percent to $1,017 an ounce.\n(Additional reporting by Apeksha Nair in Bengaluru; Editing by Dale Hudson and Lisa Von Ahn)",

The group reported a total cash cost of just $507/oz. last year. That\u2019s lower than most rivals, including Africa-focused FTSE 100 miner Randgold Resources, which reported an equivalent figure of $627/oz.\nDespite the firm\u2019s low costs and proven ability to generate cash, the stock\u2019s valuation remains very modest. At the last-seen share price of 142p, the stock trades on 9 times forecast earnings and with a 14% discount to book value.\nWith a 7% dividend yield on tap, I think that\u2019s too cheap. I\u2019d rate the stock as a buy, despite the political risk of investing in Russia.\nEarn 10% from the FTSE 100\nWhat about that FTSE 100 stock I mentioned with a 10% yield? The company concerned is coal and steel group Evraz (LSE: EVR).\nAlthough this is a Russian company, it operates facilities in a number of countries around the world, including the US and Canada. I\u2019d guess that this should reduce the likelihood of the firm being targeted by US sanctions, as this would place American jobs at risk.\nEvraz shares have trebled in value as the mining market has recovered over the last two years. But with profits still rising, the share\u2019s trailing P/E of 8.1 still looks cheap to me.\nToo cheap to ignore?\nThe main weak spot in the group\u2019s finances is that it carries quite a lot of debt. However, net debt has now fallen from a 2013 peak of $6.3bn to $4bn at the end of 2017. That gives the business a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 1.5 times, which is acceptable.\nNow that debt is under control, strong cash generation is being used to fund generous dividends.\nAnalysts expect profits to double in 2018, putting the stock on a 2018 forecast P/E of 5.4 with a prospective yield of 10%.\nThe picture is less certain for 2019, when profits are expected to fall. But even then, the shares still look affordable, on a P/E of 8 and a dividend yield of 8%.\nI continue to rate Evraz as a buy.\nMore reading\n- 2 FTSE 250 dividend stocks yielding 5%+ that I'd buy with \u00a32,000 today\n- The easiest way to beat almost everyone in the markets and make yourself a million\n- 5 shares to retire on\n- Top shares for April\n- The FTSE 100 income shares I'd buy and hold forever\n- Brexit: your 5-step investor's survival guide\nRoland Head has no position in any of the shares mentioned.

Management has, perhaps, realized the importance of shareholder returns, which is why it is taking a page out of Franco-Nevada's and Royal Gold's playbook and changing Wheaton's product mix dramatically to boost returns.\nCould Wheaton Precious Metals' stock turn your thousands into millions? Image source: Getty Images.\nThe transformation is meaningful, one that has the potential to propel Wheaton shares higher and reward shareholders with much stronger returns than in the past -- something that the market appears to be overlooking, but you shouldn't.\nThe simple reason why Wheaton fell behind\nThe growth in Royal Gold's and Franco-Nevada's top and bottom lines in the past five years can put Wheaton's lackluster performance to shame.\nIt's not that Wheaton isn't utilizing its assets or capital resources efficiently. In fact, all three companies are generating strikingly similar returns on assets and invested capital of around 3% each. The problem lies elsewhere.\nWPM revenue (TTM) data by YCharts.\nGold has historically outperformed silver, and 2017 was no different: While gold prices are up almost so far, silver notched up only about 3% gains. If you go back five years, silver prices have crashed 47% while gold has lost 24% in value.\nNow correlate the disparate movements between gold and silver prices to the operational performances of the three streaming companies, and you'll spot one common factor between Franco-Nevada and Royal Gold: Both are primarily gold companies. So while Royal Gold gets 85% of its revenue from gold, the yellow metal contributed roughly 67% to Franco-Nevada's revenue in the last quarter. Comparatively, nearly 58% of Wheaton's total production came from silver last year.\nTo cut a long story short, a larger exposure to gold proved a disadvantage for Wheaton. But that's about to change.\nWheaton's big gold push\nDuring its third quarter, only 48% of Wheaton's total revenue came from silver. While the quarter was unusually skewed toward gold, Wheaton is striving hard to rebalance its silver-to-gold mix in the long run, which is why it paid $800 million to mining giant Vale (NYSE: VALE) in 2016 to acquire the right to purchase an additional 25% of the gold produced from Vale's Brazil-based Salobo mine over and above the 50% production it already had an agreement on.",

Similarly, Freeport-McMoRan(NYSE: FCX) is another mining company with exposure to numerous minerals, including gold and molybdenum, though it's copper that's primarily responsible for putting the green in its pocket.\nLet's dig in and get to know these companies better to see which one presents investors with the better buying opportunity.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nGetting to know you\nThe self-proclaimed \"premier publicly traded copper company,\" Freeport-McMoRan's portfolio includes 11 copper- and molybdenum-producing mines in the Americas in addition to Grasberg -- one of the world's largest copper and gold deposits -- located in Indonesia. One of the largest gold-mining companies by market capitalization, Barrick Gold has been digging the yellow stuff out of the ground since 1983. The company's portfolio is comprised of five core mines found in the Americas, gold-production assets in Australia and New Guinea, and three copper-producing mines found on three different continents.\nWith an elementary understanding of the companies based on their portfolios, let's become better acquainted by comparing them on some important metrics.\nCompany\nMarket Cap\nFY 2017 Revenue\nFY 2017 EPS\nFY 2017 Free Cash Flow\nFreeport-McMoRan\n$25.4 billion\n$16.4 billion\n$1.25\n$3.3 billion\nBarrick Gold\n$14.5 billion\n$8.37 billion\n$1.23\n$669 million\nData source: Company filings and Morningstar.\nA cursory glance at the two businesses may suggest that Freeport-McMoRan is the better opportunity. Nearly doubling the revenue Barrick generated in 2017, Freeport-McMoRan churned out nearly five times as much cash as Barrick. But it would be reductive to declare Freeport-McMoRan the better opportunity based solely on these figures, so let's dig in even deeper before arriving at a decision.\nDigging out of debt\nWorking to improve its financial health, Barrick Gold has made a concerted effort over the past few years to shore up its balance sheet. Since the start of 2015, for example, the company has reduced its total debt by approximately $6.7 billion, and it intends to reduce it another $1.4 billion by the end of 2018. Illustrating the success of the debt-reduction initiative, Barrick's net debt-to-EBITDA ratio at the end of 2017 was 0.84, a reduction from the 1.41 it sported at the end of 2016. Freeport-McMoRan, on the other hand, ended 2017 with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.61.\nTo find further evidence of Barrick's more conservative stance with regard to its balance sheet, we can look to two more metrics: the debt-to-equity ratio and debt to capital. In doing so, we find that Barrick is in a much sounder position, leaving it better-suited to withstand sharp declines in the prices of gold and copper. Moreover, the company can reinvest its cash in various expansion projects like the Phase 5 leach pad expansion at Veladero.\nUncertainty in Indonesia is certainly a worry\nFreeport-McMoRan's higher debt level, in and of itself, doesn't raise a red flag; however, it becomes a concern when taking into account the company's premier asset, Grasberg. How important is the mine to Freeport-McMoRan's operations? In 2017, the Indonesian asset accounted for $1.29 billion in revenue from copper sales; the company's North American copper mines and South American copper mines provided revenue of $4.22 billion and $3.67 billion, respectively. But Grasberg's importance transcends copper; the deposit represents 99% of the company's proven and probable gold reserves.\nHowever, 2018 may prove to be a lot less lustrous for Grasberg. The company is currently at odds with the Indonesian government regarding the mine, suggesting that the company's long-term stability in the country is far from a certainty. Management remains optimistic that the dispute will be resolved, but optimism hardly equates to a guarantee.\nAs for Barrick Gold, there doesn't appear to be any comparable uncertainty regrading its operations abroad.\nChecking the price tag\nBarrick Gold seems to have the edge, but let's see how the two stocks' valuations stack up against each other. Trading at less than seven times trailing earnings, Barrick Gold seems like a bargain compared to its five-year average trailing PE ratio of 11, according to Morningstar. It even seems even more alluring in light of Freeport-McMoRan, which trades at almost 15 times trailing earnings. To provide additional insight, let's consider the valuations of the two stocks in terms of operational cash flow. Barrick currently trades at 6.6 times cash flow, while Freeport-McMoRan trades at a 5.5 multiple. Although it may appear slightly more expensive, it hardly seems to be a price that would tip the scale in Freeport-McMoRan's favor.\nAnd the winner is...\nDue to a more secure financial position, greater stability in its operations, and reasonable price tag, Barrick Gold appears to be the more compelling opportunity at the moment. Moving forward, investors should keep a keen eye on the prices of copper and gold in addition to the companies' handlings of their debt and the situation in Indonesia -- all dynamics that could drastically change the thesis for either company.\nScott Levine has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

This morning, Gold Fields and Asanko Gold most recent news is on our radar and our team decided to put out a fantastic report on the company that is now available for free below:\nGold Fields' subsidiary will acquire a 50% stake in Asanko Gold Ghana Ltd (\"AGG\")'s 90% ownership interest in the Asanko Gold Mine (AGM), associated properties, and exploration rights in Ghana. The AGM is a multi-deposit complex, with two main deposits, Nkran and Esaase, and nine known satellite deposits.\nGold Fields' subsidiary will subscribe to a 9.9% share placement in Asanko by way of a private placement of 22,354,657 Asanko shares, at a price of approximately $0.79 per share, for a total consideration of $17.6 million, anticipated to be completed in the immediate future.\nUpon closing of the transaction, Gold Fields will make an upfront payment of approximately $165 million to Asanko, and a deferred payment of $20 million. Gold Fields will fund the acquisition from cash and by drawing down on Gold Fields existing debt facilities.\nAsanko will use the proceeds primarily to repay its outstanding Red Kite debt of $164 million. Asanko will remain the manager and operator of the AGM and will receive approximately $6 million per annum for services rendered to the JV.\nA management committee, comprising representatives from Asanko and Gold Fields, will be formed for overseeing the operations of the mine. A technical sub-committee will also be formed to provide technical advisory services to the management committee.\nThe transaction is expected to close in Q3 2018, provided the Ghanaian government approves the deal.\nJV Will Give Access to Asanko's Low-Cost Production Ounces\nThe Asanko JV will give immediate access to low-cost production ounces, increasing the quality of Gold Fields' portfolio. The sizeable resource base of the asset is immediately accretive to Gold Fields in terms of life, with the potential for further discoveries on the large, relatively unexplored tenement package held by Asanko. The transaction exceeds Gold Fields' requirement of a return of 15% at a gold price of $1,300/oz, with a payback period of five years out of an anticipated life-of-mine of at least 15 years.\nThe transaction is also in-line with Gold Fields' current growth strategy of focusing on jurisdictions in which the Company already has an established footprint. The AGM is located in Ghana, where Gold Fields has more than 20 years of in-country experience.\nTransaction Presents Unique Opportunity for Asanko to De-Risk its Future Production Targets\nPeter Breese, President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Asanko, mentioned that this transaction presents a unique opportunity for Asanko to de-risk its future production targets whilst at the same time eliminating corporate debt. With a healthy balance sheet and robust operational cash flows, together with a strong technical endorsement, Asanko's Life of Mine plan is assured.\nGold Fields Views AGM as Great Addition to Existing Portfolio\nCommenting on the agreement, Nicholas Holland, CEO of Gold Fields, stated that West Africa is an important part of the Company's business, and that it looks forward to a long partnership with Asanko in Ghana. Holland added that Gold Fields views the AGM as a high-quality asset and a great addition to the Company's existing portfolio of open pit gold operations in the country.\nAbout Gold Fields Ltd\nHeadquartered in Sandton, Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa, Gold Fields is an unhedged, globally-diversified producer of gold with eight operating mines in Australia, Ghana, Peru, and South Africa, with attributable annual gold production of around 2.0 million ounces.

Young and Jan Harvey\nNEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Gold prices climbed nearly 2 percent on Wednesday, rebounding from early losses that followed stronger-than-expected U.S. inflation data, as the dollar surrendered gains and equities swung higher.\nThe dollar initially rose after the U.S. Labor Department report showed U.S. consumer prices increased more than expected in January, and traders bet the U.S. Federal Reserve would boost interest rates faster than previously forecast. [FRX/]\nHowever, softer-than-forecast retail sales data and an immediate pullback in equities markets sparked concern that the Fed would struggle to raise rates quickly enough to offset inflation pressures.\nSpot gold was up 1.7 percent at $1,351.81 per ounce by 1:37 p.m. EST (1837 GMT), after reaching $1,355.08, its highest since Jan. 26. U.S. gold futures for April delivery settled up $27.60 per ounce, or 2.1 percent, at $1,358.\nBullion was on track for its strongest daily performance since May 2017. Inflation fears generally prompt investors to buy the precious metal.\n\"Gold investors are looking into gold as a hedge against inflation and higher inflation expectations are boosting an interest in gold,\" said Suki Cooper, precious metals analyst at Standard Chartered Bank.\nU.S. stocks fell immediately after the inflation report, then rebounded and traded higher in the afternoon. In addition to the strong inflation numbers, market watchers noted a surprise drop in January retail sales. [.N]\n\"Given the weak retail sales report alongside (the inflation data), the markets are probably going to talk about stagflation, where you are getting stronger inflation but not really getting a stronger consumer,\" said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York.\n\"Those two in tandem might be leading to this flattener in Treasuries, though retail sales are pretty volatile.\"\nStock markets, which scaled record peaks in recent months, slid sharply last week, dragging gold prices as investors sought refuge in the U.S. dollar.\nMeanwhile, silver was up 1.9 percent at $16.86 an ounce after hitting a one-week high of $16.98. Palladium gained 1.8 percent to $1,002.25, earlier hitting a one-week high $1,004.60 high. Platinum rose 2 percent at $993.24, earlier hitting $998.80, its highest in nearly three weeks.\nThe platinum market is set for another surplus this year after recording oversupply of 110,000 ounces in 2017, Johnson Matthey said in a report on Wednesday, though sister metal palladium is tipped for another deficit.\n(Additional reporting by Eileen Soreng in Bengaluru; Editing by David Gregorio and David Evans)",

The rally can be attributed to weaker dollar and renewed safe-haven buying prompted by heightened geopolitical tensions.\nAccording to the World Gold Council, there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about gold\u2019s performance in 2018. A number of new mines entered production in fourth-quarter 2017, which might support mine production till 2018.\nOn the demand side, major markets, India and its neighbor China will continue to be growth drivers. Further, the United States continues to be a strong market driven by economic growth, improving employment levels and growth in consumer confidence. Demand from central banks is also expected to remain strong.\nAs per the Zacks Industry classification, the gold mining industry is grouped under the broader Basic Materials sector, which is among those Zacks sectors that are expected to rack up the strongest gains in the fourth quarter. Fourth-quarter earnings for the sector are projected to climb 43.5% while revenues are expected to spike 20.7%, per the latest Earnings Preview.\nIn this write up, we run a comparative analysis on two major gold mining stocks \u2013 Barrick Gold Corp. ABX and Newmont Mining Corp. NEM \u2013 to figure out which of these stocks is better placed ahead of their fourth-quarter earnings report.\nBarrick \u2013 the biggest producer of gold on the planet \u2013 is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter numbers on Feb 14, while Newmont will post its fourth-quarter results on Feb 22. Both Barrick and Newmont carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nOther major gold stocks reporting earnings this week and the next include Goldcorp Inc. GG, Kinross Gold Corp. KGC, Agnico Eagle Mines Limited AEM, Yamana Gold Inc. AUY and AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. AU.\nLet's take a closer look at how Barrick and Newmont are stacked up against each other in terms of certain key metrics.\nESP and Earnings History\nEarnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising in their upcoming earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank #1, 2 (Buy) or 3 and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.\nNewmont is likely to beat earnings in the quarter to be reported. This is because the stock has an Earnings ESP of +1.49% and a Zacks Rank #3. However, the picture is different for Barrick with an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3, a combination which makes surprise prediction difficult.\nWith respect to surprise, Barrick beat estimates in two of the trailing four quarters while missed twice. In this timeframe, it came up with an average negative surprise of 8.2%. On the other hand, Newmont has a fairly impressive surprise history, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 17.6%.\nGrowth Expectations\nIn terms of earnings growth expectations, Newmont scores way above Barrick. The expected earnings per share growth rate for Newmont for the fourth quarter currently stands at 21.2% compared with an expected decline of 4.6% for Barrick.\nPrice Performance\nNewmont clearly outpaced Barrick in terms of price performance in 2017. Newmont\u2019s shares rallied 10.1% for the year while Barrick lost 9.4%. Newmont also outperformed the broader industry\u2019s gain of 9.2%.",
