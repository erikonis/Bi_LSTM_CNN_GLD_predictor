Just as the rest of the market, the oldest of Wall Street\u2019s three main stock indexes had rallied on prospects of a resilient economy, ebbing inflation and robust earnings.\nThe last time the measure of blue chips broke a major milestone was in November 2020 \u2014 when it topped 30,000 \u2014 amid market-friendly developments that unleashed animal spirits even as the pandemic continued to rage. This time around, the market is defying the old adage \u201csell in May and go away,\u201d with equities on pace for their best month in 2024.\n\u201cBreaking the 40,000 barrier is a big psychological boost for the bulls as round numbers hold special significance in people\u2019s hearts and minds,\u201d said Chris Zaccarelli at Independent Advisor Alliance. \u201cMarkets are now headed into \u2018overvalued territory,\u2019 so it\u2019s prudent to dollar-cost average and be more discerning when investing in equities.\u201d\nThe S&P 500 closed below 5,300. Walmart Inc. surged on a bullish outlook as the big-box retailer attracts consumers looking for essentials and discounts. GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. tumbled as the meme-stock frenzy faded.\nTreasury 10-year yields rose four basis points to 4.38%. The dollar bounced back after dropping to a one-month low.\n\u201c40,000 is a great milestone, but at the end of the day, there isn\u2019t much difference between 39,999 and 40,000,\u201d said Ryan Detrick at Carson Group. \u201cStill, this is a great reminder of how far we\u2019ve come. Think about how many people were talking about recessions and bear markets all of last year, now we are once again back to new highs.\u201d\nCan stocks keep going?\n\u201cWe think they can,\u201d Detrick said. \u201cEarnings continue to surprise to the upside, balance sheets for Corporate America are in great shape, while the consumer might have some cracks, but is still strong thanks to a very healthy employment backdrop. Then consider lower rates are likely coming, thanks to inflation that should drastically improve in the second half of this year.\u201d\nTo Matt Maley at Miller Tabak + Co., a very short-term \u201cbreather\u201d is quite likely right now and would be a healthy development after the rally to fresh records.\n\u201cThere is a lot of leeway for the stock market if we do see a short-term pullback soon,\u201d Maley said. \u201cPut another way, the bulls are still fully in charge right now, and so it will take a significant reversal to stem the tide of the upside momentum.\u201d\n\u201cThe market is showing more and more confidence in a genuine soft landing or even no landing scenario where overall economic growth in the US continues to stay solid,\u201d said Lisa Shalett at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. \u201cIt makes sense that a broader group of companies, even those that are more cyclical in areas like industrials, materials and energy can do well.\u201d\nAnalysts have ratcheted up earnings forecasts for the current quarter at the swiftest pace in two years, suggesting that the worst of the US profit slump may be firmly in the rear-view mirror, Bloomberg Intelligence data show.\nTo John Lynch at Comerica Wealth Management, the Dow hitting 40,000 is a testament to the powers of capital formation, innovation, profit growth, and economic resilience.\n\u201cThe recent technical momentum and fundamental strengths, including earnings and interest rates, suggest further near-term gains,\u201d he said. \u201cInvestors should be careful not to sprint on the victory lap, though, as a combination of geopolitics, valuation, and market interest rates may lead to a sudden directional shift.\u201d\nIt\u2019s also worth saying that while the Dow Average has evolved over time since it was first launched in 1896 by American journalist Charles Dow, it\u2019s still a much narrower equity gauge than the S&P 500 or Nasdaq 100.\nThe Dow is price-weighted, meaning that changes in the highest-priced stocks have greater impact on the index level than price changes in the lower-priced stocks. The S&P 500, however, is market-cap-weighted.\nTraders also kept a close eye on a drumbeat of Fed speakers, with three officials saying the central bank should keep borrowing costs high for longer as policymakers await more evidence inflation is easing, suggesting they\u2019re not in a rush to cut interest rates.\nCleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, New York Fed President John Williams and Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin, speaking separately Thursday, argued it may take longer for inflation to reach their 2% target.\nMeantime, Jamie Dimon said he\u2019s still more worried about inflation than markets appear to be.\nThe JPMorgan Chase & Co. chief said significant price pressures are still influencing the US economy and may mean interest rates will be higher for longer than many investors are expecting. Dimon cited costs linked to the green economy, re-militarization, infrastructure spending, trade disputes and large fiscal deficits.\n\u201cThere are a lot of inflationary forces in front of us,\u201d Dimon said in an interview on Bloomberg Television Thursday. \u201cThe underlying inflation may not go away the way people expect it to.\u201d\nCorporate Highlights:\nAmgen Inc. won US approval for a new drug to treat a particularly aggressive form of advanced lung cancer, providing a badly needed new option for patients when chemotherapy stops working.\nUnder Armour Inc. will restructure its business amid a continued decline in revenue and make men\u2019s apparel its highest priority as the company realigns itself under founder Kevin Plank.\nTractor maker Deere & Co. reduced its profit outlook for the year as declining agriculture income pressured the world\u2019s biggest farm machinery maker.\nCharles Schwab Corp. said Chief Financial Officer Peter Crawford is leaving after 22 years with the firm and will be replaced by Mike Verdeschi from Citigroup Inc. as part of a series of management changes.\nMeta Platforms Inc. is under investigation by the European Union over concerns its algorithms are illegally exploiting the weakness of children to get them addicted to Facebook and Instagram.\nUnited Airlines Holdings Inc. said it can begin the process to add new planes and routes again after the Federal Aviation Administration indicated it would ease restrictions, a sign of progress after a series of safety issues led to a clampdown on the carrier\u2019s operations.\nKey events this week:\nChina property prices, retail sales, industrial production, Friday\nEurozone CPI, Friday\nUS Conf.

But that belies the emotional angst that many people are feeling.\"\nThat anxiety \u2014 driven by everything from inflation to geopolitical tensions \u2014 has helped power a record surge in gold prices, which hit $2,450 per ounce in May, up from $2,100 at the beginning of March. Precious metals like gold and silver are sometimes seen as \"safe haven assets\" that hedge against inflation and stock market volatility. But they can come with their own downsides.\n\"I haven't had a single client ask me about buying gold,\" Baker conceded. But, he added, those who are eyeing it should ask themselves if they're willing to monitor gold prices regularly enough to know when it may be time to sell.\nIt can be helpful to set out \"a particular target relative to appreciation,\" he said. For example, \"that might be a trigger to say, 'OK, we had an election. It's OK.

We entered into an agreement with TuNya, which provides both exploration funding and access to a technical team with over 125 years of combined experience on the extremely prolific Ashanti gold belt, including significant experience at the Obuasi mine itself. We anticipate this additional knowledge to provide real value to the development of the next phase of exploration at Obuasi.\"\n\"In addition, our drill program at our Manfo Project on the Sefwi Belt in Ghana extended known mineralization at the southern ends of both the Pokukrom East and West deposits. Potential remains to establish additional extensions to the mineralization and to grow the Manfo resource with continued drilling at a number of the targets yet to be drilled around these deposits, plus exploration drill testing of multiple targets across the property.\n\"In Canada, several of our properties are benefitting from exploration completed by others. We anticipate exploration at both our Birch Lake and Grenfell properties to be completed by our option partners, First Mining and Record Gold, in 2024. Our Seeley property near Hemlo will benefit from exploration, including 2,500 m of drilling completed by Barrick on Hemlo Explorer's Pic Project. Our Mann property has benefitted from new data provided by the significant discovery made by Canada Nickel on its adjacent Mann Northwest Project.\"\nGHANA\nManfo Project\nThe 96 km\u00b2 Manfo project, located in the Sefwi-Bibiani Belts 15 km southeast of Newmont's Ahafo gold mine and 40 km north of Asante Gold's Bibiani gold mine, has recently been Pelangio's exploration focus in Ghana. Refer to Figure 1. In 2013, SRK Consulting estimated the project hosts a gold mineral resource of 195,000 oz (at 1.52 g/t Au) Indicated and 298,000 oz (at 0.96 g/t Au) Inferred with the bulk of the resource contained in the two Pokukrom deposits.\u00b9\nIn 2021, Pelangio identified opportunities to grow the project through step-out drill testing of open-ended mineralization in the known deposits to demonstrate possible extensions that would be further drilled for potential resource addition, plus drill testing of multiple exploration targets along and near the 9 km of mineralized structures within the property. A multi-phase 3,700 m diamond drill program was planned of which\n1,423 m has been drilled to date.\nThe 2023 drill program, detailed in Pelangio's July 24, 2023 news release, tested for strike and down-dip extensions in select areas of both Pokukrom East and West deposits, in addition to a soil plus auger gold geochemical target sitting on the western flank of Pokukrom East. The drill hole south of Pokukrom West returned an intercept of 1.88 g/t Au over 13 m, including 4.01 g/t over 4 m. The shallow oxide mineralization is still open further to the south and the potential remains to expand the Pokukrom West resource with further drilling to the south. The down-dip drill test at the shallower southern end of Pokukrom East intercepted 0.71 g/t Au over 20 m plus 1.66 g/t Au over 7 m, including 1 m of 8.43 g/t Au. The mineralization remains open down-dip in this area and there is potential to expand the resource to depth here.\nThe 2023 program followed the 2021 program at Pokukrom West. The first hole of the 2021 program was drilled in the midst of previous drilling to gain a better understanding of the structural controls on the mineralization. It returned an intercept of 3.81 g/t Au over 15 m, including 5.65 g/t Au over 7 m - better than surrounding holes. The second hole tested for the down-plunge continuation of the Pokukrom West lode. It returned an encouraging intercept of 3.19 g/t Au over 12 m, including 6.85 g/t Au over 3 m, demonstrating that the Pokukrom West deposit does in fact continue down-plunge. Table 1 summarizes the significant drill intercepts at Pokukrom from the 2021 and 2023 programs, and Figure 2 illustrates the drill hole locations.\nWith a number of targets yet to be drilled in the planned resource step-out diamond drilling program around the Pokukrom deposits, potential remains to establish additional extensions to mineralization and potentially grow the resource with infill drilling. This would be followed with a resource estimation update for Manfo which, at a higher gold price than the US$1,450/oz used in the 2013 MRE, is expected to result in some addition to the Manfo project gold resource. In addition, a 7,000 m exploration air-core drilling program is planned to test up to 21 previously untested geological, geochemical, and structural targets along and near the 9 km long main structural corridor, which could yield satellite deposit discoveries that might also add significantly to the project. With a defined gold mineral resource and a number of opportunities remaining to add to it, Manfo continues to be Pelangio's priority in Ghana.\n-\nThe Manfo mineral resource estimation was conducted by SRK Consulting and published in June 2013. (Refer to the Mineral Resource Evaluation Technical Report, Manfo Gold Project, by SRK Consulting (Canada) Inc., released on June 21, 2013 and available on Pelangio's website). The resource estimation was made in accordance with National Instrument 43\u2010101 \u2010 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects at the time of the mineral resource estimation in 2013. NI 43-101 standards for disclosure have been amended multiple times since 2013 and as a result, Pelangio's 2013 resource estimate is no longer NI 43-101 compliant under the current standards.\nObuasi Project\nPelangio's 100% owned Obuasi project covers 284 km\u00b2 immediately adjacent to and on geological strike with AngloGold Ashanti's 25 Moz Obuasi Mine. Refer to Figures 1 and 3. The Obuasi project is also immediately adjacent to TuNya's property, which hosts the Kyereboso deposit. Obuasi was Pelangio's flagship project in Ghana from 2007 to 2011. With the recent litigation settlement and a recently signed binding letter of intent (\"LOI\") to option a portion of the Obuasi property to TuNya Mineral Resources, Pelangio is turning new focus to the Obuasi project.\nEarly exploration activity plus subsequent and more recent data reanalysis, prospectivity and targeting exercises prioritized two large principal target areas for follow-up exploration situated in the southwestern corner of the property closest to the Obuasi Mine property. The Obuasi Targets area covers the strike extension of geological stratigraphy along which the Obuasi deposits lie. The NGA Targets area straddles the main Birimian-Tarkwaian metasedimentary contact and has seen minimal drill testing by Pelangio, although two drill holes returned high grades over narrow widths, including 24.50 g/t Au over 1 m and 11.28 g/t Au over 2 m. This high-grade prospect will likely be one of the first revisited after completion of the work by TuNya.\nOngoing work on the Obuasi project will continue the desktop target development and ranking exercise, augmented by fieldwork to include a comprehensive review of drill core, detailed field mapping and a structural study. This effort will be conducted largely by TuNya's \"Obuasi experts.\" Pelangio and TuNya's LOI includes an option for TuNya to earn into an 80% interest on the southern portion of Pelangio's Obuasi project covering principally Tarkwaian geology. For details, refer to Pelangio's July 31, 2023 news release. This allows TuNya to explore the Tarkwaian for extensions and additions to their Kyereboso deposit that could result in a more robust project for them, while Pelangio maintains a 20% interest in ground that was unlikely to be explored by Pelangio over the near term. In exchange, TuNya will undertake a comprehensive review of Pelangio's Obuasi property prospects, focusing on the Obuasi and NGA Target areas and utilizing their personnel who have considerable senior technical and management experience at the Obuasi Mine and elsewhere along the Ashanti Belt.\nWorking with TuNya and their new products, Pelangio expects to be able to develop a more informed ranked target list for ongoing Obuasi exploration. At the same time, Pelangio plans to enhance this with improved geochemical and geophysical datasets through targeted auger drilling programs plus a high resolution airborne aeromagnetic survey covering the western third of the Obuasi property. As has been done in the past at Obuasi, upon completion of these programs, an AI (artificial intelligence) prospectivity platform can be utilized to generate smarter exploration targets with better, more detailed datasets. This work will be guided by the Obuasi expertise of TuNya's technical people, including a structural geologist, a geophysicist, and a GIS specialist. These efforts should ultimately delineate the very best targets for drill testing. Drill testing will initially be performed at shallow depths, followed by deeper probes as and where warranted.\nDankran Project\nPelangio entered into an option agreement to acquire the Dankran property adjacent to the Obuom mine and contiguous to the northeast corner of Pelangio's Obuasi property in late 2020.Refer to Figure 3. The Dankran project, which is now 100% owned by Pelangio, has shown evidence of high-grade gold potential on the Obuasi-Obuom trend from limited, shallow (<70 m vertical) RC drill testing, which warrants follow up drilling. While currently a lower priority than Pelangio's Manfo and Obuasi projects, the Dankran project represents an early-stage, high-grade gold exploration opportunity hosting 7 km of underexplored strike of the Ashanti Belt, 25 km away from the world-class Obuasi Mine.\nCANADA\nBirch Lake Project\nPelangio's 100% owned Birch Lake Project is located within the Birch-Uchi Belt, 120 km northeast of Red Lake and contiguous with First Mining Gold's claims covering the Springpole deposit, approximately 3 km from the proposed open pit. See Figure 4. First Mining has an initial option to earn a 51% interest in the project by paying Pelangio $220,000, issuing 2,100,000 shares and spending $1,500,000 in exploration over seven years, since the signing of their earn-in agreement in 2021. First Mining has an additional option to increase its interest to 80% by spending an additional $1,750,000 in exploration and paying $400,000 in cash or shares over two years.\nDuring 2022-2023, First Mining conducted mapping and geochemical sampling and flew the Birch Lake property with an electromagnetic and magnetic survey as part of an extensive district-wide airborne survey. One target was drilled and additional drilling is anticipated in 2024, dependent on weather conditions and permitting.\nGrenfell Project\nPelangio's Grenfell property is located 10 km northwest of the Macassa Mine owned by Agnico-Eagle Mines Limited. In 2022, Pelangio granted Record Gold the option to acquire an 80% interest in the Grenfell property by paying Pelangio $60,000 and incurring $2,000,000 in exploration expenditures over five years. To maintain the option, Record Gold shall pay $60,000 and complete $250,000 of exploration expenditures by August 19, 2024.\nPelangio conducted two diamond drilling programs in 2020 and 2021 with notable drilling results of\n1.32 g/t Au over 26.0m including 314 g/t Au over 1.74 m (uncut) and 10.95 g/t Au over 3.00 m including 23.40 g/t Au over 1.00 m.\nSeeley Project\nPelangio's 100% owned Seeley Project located near Hemlo, Ontario, is surrounded by the Pic Project owned by Hemlo Explorers. See Figure 5. Previous work on the project by Pelangio in 1997 and 2008 included gold results of 4.71 g Au/t over 1 m and 4.85 g Au/t over 2 m, associated with anomalous copper and zinc values, and indicated alteration and a geologic setting similar to that found with volcanic-associated massive sulfide (VMS) deposits, which are frequently sources of metals such as copper, lead, and zinc. In 2009 mapping, prospecting and soil sampling resulted in seven anomalies around previous Pelangio drilling. The geological mapping and whole rock analysis indicated potential for gold deposits and identified ultramafic rocks anomolous in nickel. Notably, Barrick is completing a 2,500 m drill program on Hemlo Explorer's Pic project.\nMann Project\nPelangio's 100% owned Mann project has come to the forefront with a recent nearby discovery by Canada Nickel Company. Canada Nickel is advancing their 2 billion tonne Crawford nickel project and aggressively exploring multiple properties in the district. The Mann Property is located in Mann Township, 50 km northeast of the City of Timmins, and covers an area of approximately 2 km\u00b2. Pelangio's patented claims (mining and surface rights) cover a portion of a large ultramafic intrusive complex that is prospective for nickel, copper, cobalt, chromium and PGEs close to where Canada Nickel has just reported assays from a significant new discovery on their Mann Northwest Property surrounding Pelangio's patented claims (see Canada Nickel's August 22, 2023 release). See Figure 6.\nCanada Nickel drilled eight holes from May to July 2023, testing 2.7 km of strike. Each hole returned multi-hundred-meter-wide intersections of \"strongly serpentinized peridotite, dunite and pyroxenite with fine mineralization throughout.\" Canada Nickel reported assays from five of the eight holes drilled which were all mineralized with significant nickel, platinum and palladium values returning up to 348.5 m of 0.23% Ni and 0.04 g/t Pt+Pd including 33 m of 0.31% Ni and 0.057 g/t Pt+Pd. This hole also ended with 28.9 m of 0.52 g/t Pt+Pd. Canada Nickel's drill holes are located 2.2 km from Pelangio's Mann property boundary. The Mann patents cover historical airborne electromagnetic anomalies that experienced limited shallow drill testing by Inco from 1948 to 1951 and returned significant nickel values over narrow widths. Given the very significant nearby discovery by Canada Nickel, Pelangio is currently considering exploration programs to evaluate the potential of the property.\nQualified Person\nMr. Kevin Thomson, P.Geo.

Early on in this session, the attention of global investors was taken hold of by a developing story\u2014although certainly not a \u201cnew\u201d one\u2014that we may do well to pay more attention to over the summer: the US Dollar hit a 38-year high vs. the Japanese Yen, as Tokyo\u2019s currency continues to dip and lead traders and analysts to speculate about near-term intervention from the Bank of Japan. More than any real concern about a Yen-centric boon to the global economy (although, never say \u201cnever\u201d), gold prices were suppressed lower by Greenback\u2019s aggressive climb. For a time, it looked as though the chart might threaten recent support at the $2300 level with a few forays lower, but by the start of New York\u2019s midweek session, buyers had once again stepped in to support gold and the bid/ask spread for spot held steady alongside that key psychological number through the US hours and the Thursday overnights.\nIn the US morning, the waning gold chart provided an unexpected tailwind from what we likely would have written off on Monday as relatively minor data reports for the yellow metal in the form of the latest Durable Goods report at the 3rd calculation (second revision) of the US\u2019 Q1 GDP growth rate. For Durable Goods, while the new number for May moderately outperformed expectations, the prior month\u2019s read was revised lower by as much as 60% of the original print. Also, a deeper look into the May numbers suggests that the only reason for the beat vs. projections was a large uptick in \u201cdefense aircraft,\u201d which is not likely to have been driven by the US consumer. Analysis of new orders for durable goods also fell considerably. Layered within the Commerce Department\u2019s updated Q1 GDP calculations, there were also strong signals that consumer spending in the US has been meaningfully slowed in 2024.",

I\u2019d like to know if it\u2019s worth doing and if it\u2019d make life easier for me as I think keeping gold is easier than Lamborghinis.\u201d\nMr Ash, who lives in Nottingham, has no mortgage to pay off, no debts and no children. He\u2019s also keen on exploring investment opportunities.\nHe has taken a coaching session with financial planners Bestinvest, but doesn\u2019t have experience with wealth management.\n\u201cI know I need to be in it for the long term, but I don\u2019t really know where I\u2019d start,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI think it\u2019d be good to have a good spread of investments.\u201d\nCharles Ambler, co-chief investment officer at Saltus, says:\nHowever, when looking at gold as an investment, it is important to understand the drivers of the market: both buyers and holders, such as central banks, international retail buyers, the Indian consumer and contract speculators, that will use derivative products rather than buying physical gold.\nGold is often thought of as a global macro hedge, so it\u2019s an asset class that is designed to benefit from sudden negative macro events such as political or economic stress.\nIn real terms, an investment of \u00a310,000 over the last 10 years would be worth \u00a321,500 today.\nNot a bad return, however we should caveat that the value of gold is currently high and inflation has been very low for a lot of the last decade which enhances the real return per annum \u2013 it is also highly volatile.\nFor context, over the longer term, gold has typically done circa 8pc per annum but with volatility of 23pc; over the same time period, global equities (the great companies of the world) have achieved circa 12pc per annum with lower volatility of 17pc.\nThere are now very large and very committed, newish, buyers in a market in the form of the Chinese and Russian central banks.\nThey have put a major floor on the gold price vs history which has caused prices to rise and for the traditional inverse relationship between the gold price and real yields to break down somewhat.\nReal yields have been rising in the post-Covid era as central banks in the West raised rates which should, all else equal, have caused gold to fall in price\nHowever, this has not been the case as certain central banks started to increase gold buying following the invasion of Ukraine and US sanctions on Russian dollar-based reserves.\nTo put some context on this, during 2023, the Chinese central bank was the largest buyer of physical gold at 225 metric tonnes, the next closest country was Poland at 130 metric tonnes followed by Singapore at 30 metric tonnes.\nAccording to the World Gold Council, China\u2019s buying is the largest by a central bank since 1977. These additional buyers are causing gold prices to structurally shift up.\nThere is a strong argument to be made that de-dollarisation will continue and hence these central bank buyers are unlikely to step away from the gold market for some time.\nOn top of this, as central banks begin cutting rates, this will lower real yields, which should make gold relatively more attractive to potential buyers. All of this suggests that gold will likely continue to rise in price.\nThere are similar storage needs for gold as there are with expensive cars \u2013 a secure location with adequate security and insurance.\nThese conditions come at a cost. It is very unlikely that household insurance would cover bullion and so a separate policy would be required which would have specific requirements on storage.\nAnother option for Mr Ash is to buy a physical gold Exchange Traded Fund (EFT).\nA physical gold ETF is a listed instrument that owns physical gold and participates in the price changes but without having the risk of theft.\nJohn Moore, senior investment manager at wealth manager RBC Brewin Dolphin, says:\nSelling a tangible and highly enjoyable collection of Lamborghinis is going to be a big shift in mentality for Mr Ash.\nCombined with his limited experience of investments, he would benefit from spending more time with an adviser to frame his goals and understand how to respond to inevitable market volatility.\nGiven his current circumstances, I am going to assume a medium- to high-risk approach, substantially invested in equities.\nMr Ash should still have some liquidity, with around 2pc of his assets in a high-interest, easy access account that would offer a reasonable return and flexibility.\nA further 8pc could be allocated to short duration gilts that trade below par, offering tax-free capital upside on the assumption that they are held to maturity.\nWith the equity allocation, he could allocate around 70pc to overseas stocks and shares with a bias towards household names, which have good long-term growth prospects.\nLuxury goods group LVMH is likely to be of interest, while Nestl\u00e9 and Novartis offer more \u201clittle and often\u201d transaction appeal and the Swiss franc exposure will help with wider portfolio balance.\nTurning to the US, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon offer leadership in their respective technology-driven areas and would provide exposure to AI growth opportunities.\nVisa and Booking Holdings offer a proxy on financial transaction growth and discretionary spending trends. Warren Buffet\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway provides an investment trust-like approach to collecting a range of assets.\nAdding an S&P 500 tracker will broaden the market exposure in the USA. Actively managed funds like GQG US Equity Growth and BNY North American Income will also further diversification, without duplicating other parts of the portfolio.\nLooking at Asia, I believe that this is best accessed through funds and Stewart Investors Asia Pacific Leaders and Fidelity Asian Values Investment Trust offer attractive, well-researched, but slightly different, approaches. M&G Japan takes a flexible approach to a market that is often difficult to read but has opportunities for patient investors.\nAdding some global exposure will help add coverage and balance.\nScottish Mortgage looks for businesses that offer growth potential from disruptive trends, but also has exposure to Tesla, Ferrari, and Northvolt in its top 15 holdings.\nTurning to the UK, Diageo and Haleon offer consumer-based growth from international markets. Ashtead is a great play on infrastructure spending trends, while Experian and RELX have great positions in the financial, legal, and medical data world.\nBP owns the Castrol brand recommended for Lamborghini engines and the company\u2019s portfolio offers a hedge against energy needs and oil price spikes.\nFinally, Mr Ash has mentioned exposure to gold, which I would suggest should be no more than 5pc of the portfolio.\nWe typically recommend buying direct exposure to the gold spot price through the likes of an iShares Physical Gold ETC or similar. This removes the need to store physical metal and takes away the risk of investing in gold miners, which typically operate in politically risky parts of the world.",

He added, \"I look for the entire asset class to 4X by the time of the US mid-terms in late 2026.\"\nStandard Chartered highlight several factors contributing to this growth projection.\nThese include potential regulatory changes, such as a repeal of SAB 121 and favorable stablecoin regulations, which the bank anticipates could be enacted shortly after the new administration takes office in January 2025.\nAdditionally, Standard Chartered expects the SEC to adopt a softer regulatory stance on digital assets, further opening pathways for mainstream use.\nTrending: Over the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83% \u2014 Investors like Bill O\u2019Reilly and Rudy Giuliani are using this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence.\nThe report also suggests that assets closely linked to practical, end-use cases\u2014like Solana (CRYPTO: SOL), which the bank expects to outperform Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), and Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH)\u2014are likely to see the most significant growth.\nKendrick sees strong growth potential for sectors like gaming, tokenization, and emerging areas such as decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN) and consumer social, which he notes are still in early stages of development.\nFurthermore, while Standard Chartered considers a U.S. Bitcoin reserve a low-probability event, it notes this move could have a significant impact on the digital assets market if implemented.\nAlso Read: Dogecoin millionaires are increasing \u2013 investors with $1M+ in DOGE revealed!\nKendrick emphasizes that the regulatory clarity and adoption policies expected from a Trump administration could lift the entire asset class, providing an environment conducive to digital assets going mainstream.",

Instead, last year's buying was more of a catch up to currency holdings.\n\"Looking at the IMF IFS data, we see few signs that gold is significantly more popular than the fiat currencies,\" Dolgin said. \"Although the headline share of gold increased from 14.4% to 15.9% of total international reserves over 2023, this entire increase was due to revaluation effect. Assuming a fixed gold price of end-2023, the share of gold didn't change over 2023.\"\nMeanwhile, the Chinese yuan saw its share of reserves decline, though that's largely on account of Russian activity. Before 2022, Moscow held a third of global yuan reserves, but was forced to sell when faced with a budget deficit.\nThe \"yuanization\" of global reserves has likely slowed outside of Russia as well, Dolgin said.\nThis currency has often been pitted against the greenback as an up-and-coming challenger, and ING acknowledged that broad yuanisation remains on the agenda for Beijing.\nReserves aside, the tender has made gains in international finance last year, with its share of global payments surging on the SWIFT financial system. But this may prove temporary, as the role of yuan in trade finance has already begun moderating into 2024:",

In fact, at the beginning of July, Nvidia stock hit a $4 trillion market cap for the first time, making it the very first company to reach this huge milestone, thanks in part to the generative AI boom.\nIf you were wise enough to hang onto your initial investment, here\u2019s how much you\u2019d have today if you invested $1,000 in Nvidia in 2015.\nQuick Take: Nvidia Stock (NVDA)\nNvidia (NVDA) is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Nvidia\u2019s focus has shifted from PC graphics to the new frontiers of artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR) platforms, and high-performance computing (HPC).\nThe recent rally for Nvidia has come even in the wake of political tariff tensions and ongoing issues with sales due to trouble getting chips from China. Here are some key numbers as of July 9, 2025:\n-\nStock price: $162.83\n-\nMarket cap: $3.97 trillion\n-\n52-week high: $164.42\n-\n52-week low: $86.63\n-\nDividend yield: 0.025%\nRead Next: I\u2019m a Financial Advisor: 4 Investing Rules My Millionaire Clients Never Break\nNvidia Investment Now vs. 10 Years Ago\nIn 2015, Nvidia\u2019s stock price was around $0.80 per share. That\u2019s right, 80 cents. A $1,000 investment made back then would have purchased you around 1,250 shares of NVDA. As the stock is currently running at about $163 per share, your investment would be worth about a whopping $203,750.\nTo put this into perspective, a $1,000 investment in Nvidia in 2015 would have yielded you much more than the same $1,000 investment in the S&P 500 or gold during the same period.\nNvidia\u2019s Upside Potential: Is It a Good Buy?\nThere\u2019s even more upside forecasted for Nvidia as they explore AI technologies, make headway into advanced computing, and even advance toward developing autonomous vehicles in collaboration with luxury automakers like Mercedes-Benz and Audi. The generative AI boom has helped push the company to become the first to reach a $4 trillion market capitalization.\nHowever, it\u2019s good to keep in mind that many investors have been selling the stock heavily over the last couple of months while business is still performing strongly. Nvidia stock is trading at relatively cheap valuations right now, and it remains on many analysts\u2019 lists of high-risk, high-reward growth stocks to buy now. But keep in mind, as always, to proceed with caution.",

The metal hit an all-time high on Oct. 30, and since then it's been in retreat for the most part.\nThere are several reasons for this. As ever when an asset rises notably, many investors are tempted to sell it in the hope of getting out at or near a peak. This was likely happening with gold, and this can lead to something of a copycat effect shortly thereafter.\nAnother major factor is the comedown from Election Day and business-friendly Donald Trump's unexpected victory in the presidential race (which led to a brief pop in the otherwise sliding price).\nTrump has pledged to impose punitive tariffs on countries that actively export to the U.S. like China. Tariffs tend to strengthen the U.S. dollar due a number of factors, one of the main ones being that they have a habit of driving up inflation with the sudden spike in U.S. demand for domestic products. To combat inflation, the Federal Reserve (Fed) is likely to raise its key interest rate, making the dollar more attractive and therefore bumping up its value.\nWhen the dollar strengthens notably, like it has in recent days, this can have a negative effect on dollar-denominated assets. That's largely because investors operating in other currencies are forced to pay more for them. This is contributing to the gold sell-off which, as ever, is having a direct impact on the stocks of companies that mine it.\nThis ride could get bumpy\nAfter such a long period in which investors were basically euphoric about gold, it's possible we're entering an era of uncertainty for the metal. While it remains to be seen exactly how Trump's plans take shape, the market is wary right now, and it doesn't feel as if this is a brief correction or reset. It might be best to sit on the sidelines with both gold and gold stocks these days.",

To add perspective, many Bitcoin ETFs also saw a significant uptick, trading at nearly twice their typical volume.

Additionally, Trump's return to office has sparked optimism in the crypto space, with many pointing to his pro-crypto stance and anticipated policy support as potential catalysts for Bitcoin's continued growth.\nAs Bitcoin ETFs break new ground, the broader landscape has seen asset managers scramble to file for a range of altcoin-focused ETFs, including those for Solana, XRP and Litecoin. They've also proposed several crypto index ETFs, allowing investors to hold diversified digital assets.\nBalchunas previously described these filings as \"call options on a Trump victory,\" indicating that fund managers may be banking on a favorable regulatory climate under the new administration. Should pro-crypto policies become a reality, experts believe the market may see even more significant inflows and innovations in the ETF space.",

Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 230,000 claims for the latest week, although the data was not considered to be a notable shift in the labor market due to seasonal factors.\nA closely watched part of the Treasury yield curve steepened as the uptick in unemployment claims added to the view that the Fed is likely to begin cutting interest rates in September.",

Gaza's economy, for instance, saw an 86% decline in Q4 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. Trade disruptions, notably through the Suez Canal, have also affected regional and global commerce.\nOver the last decade, many MENA economies have faced rising debt-to-GDP ratios, particularly among oil-importing countries, which struggle to reduce these ratios due to high oil prices. The inability to lower debt through inflation, exacerbated by exchange rate fluctuations and off-budget factors (stock-flow adjustments), underscores the need for greater debt transparency. In contrast, oil-exporting nations tend to see smaller increases in debt-to-GDP ratios during periods of high GDP growth, and in some cases, a decrease.\nMeanwhile, private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) investments have gained momentum in the Middle East and Africa, reflecting a shift in investment trends. Data from Preqin and the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) reveals that about 65% of regional investors plan to maintain or increase their exposure to private equity in 2024, with 56% expressing similar interest in venture capital.\nDespite the challenges posed by geopolitical tensions, venture capital continues to play a crucial role in the region's investment landscape. Investors remain optimistic, with many reporting that their PE and VC investments have met or exceeded expectations. Key sectors attracting interest include fintech, technology, healthcare, and infrastructure.\nAs the region navigates the complexities of economic growth, debt management, and investment trends, it's clear that there are both challenges and opportunities on the horizon. Investors remain optimistic about the region's potential, however, it's essential for policymakers to prioritize debt transparency, economic diversification, and infrastructure development to unlock the full potential of the MENA region's economies. With that in context, let's take a look at the 10 worst Middle East and Africa stocks to buy according to short sellers.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we used a Finviz stock screener to find 20 large companies in the Middle East and Africa, by market cap. From that list, we shortlisted companies that have the highest percentage of shares outstanding that were sold short. The list is sorted in ascending order of their short interest. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA mining truck loaded with precious metals in an open pit mine.\nSibanye Stillwater (NYSE:SBSW) is a multinational mining and metals processing company based in South Africa. The company is one of the world\u2019s largest producers of platinum, palladium, rhodium, and gold. Sibanye Stillwater (NYSE:SBSW) also engages in the extraction and refining of iridium, ruthenium, nickel, chrome, copper, and cobalt. Sibanye Stillwater (NYSE:SBSW) is a global leader in recycling platinum group metals (PGM), commonly known as catalytic converters. In recent years, Sibanye Stillwater (NYSE:SBSW) has expanded into the battery metals sector, focusing on mining and processing critical materials and reprocessing mining waste to recover valuable minerals.\nFor the quarter ending March 31, Sibanye Stillwater (NYSE:SBSW) delivered strong operational performance, particularly in its U.S. Platinum Group Metals segment, where platinum and palladium output surged 22%. The company also saw a 28% reduction in All-In Sustaining Costs (AISC), boosting adjusted EBITDA despite lower PGM prices. Production from its South African operations, including platinum, palladium, rhodium, and ruthenium, increased by 3%, driven by the acquisition of an additional 50% stake in the Kroondal mine, one of South Africa's largest platinum reserves. Additionally, the company\u2019s Sandouville nickel refinery reported a 42% increase in production and a 36% reduction in sustaining costs. Although gold production dipped slightly, the company maintained strong EBITDA thanks to favorable gold prices.\nSibanye Stillwater\u2019s (NYSE:SBSW) Keliber lithium project in Finland is advancing on schedule and within budget which will position the company to benefit from rising demand for lithium and battery materials. In August, the company secured a $560 million green financing package to fund the full development of this project, including the construction of lithium mining, processing, and refining facilities.\nWhile 2.39% of the company's shares are shorted, 18 hedge funds have maintained a bullish sentiment on the stock as of the second quarter with stakes worth $129.07 million.

Investors believe inflation will continue to move toward the Fed's preferred 2% target. The Fed can then focus on the labor market and lower interest rates to achieve the highly sought-after soft landing scenario.\nRecently, however, billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones, who has successfully managed the hedge fund Tudor Investment Corporation for four decades, went on CNBC and said, \"All roads lead to inflation.\" The two messages seem to contradict one another, because the Fed probably wouldn't have a lot of room to lower interest rates if inflation reignited. But could both the market and Jones be right? Let's take a look.\nA look at the national debt\nThe Fed's two mandates are to support stable prices and maximum employment. However, according to Jones, the country's finances will overshadow these goals, especially considering that both presidential candidates are proposing policies that could drastically increase spending and the federal deficit, which occurs when the government spends more money than it takes in. The federal deficit ballooned to more than $1.8 trillion in fiscal year 2024, which is 8% higher than the prior fiscal year.\nThe total national debt is closing in on $36 trillion. A number like this can be difficult for people to wrap their heads around and there are certainly experts that might suggest it's still manageable. However, the U.S. spent 17% of its total budget in fiscal 2024 on debt interest payments. If interest rates rise, the cost of maintaining the debt will increase as well because the U.S. Treasury Department has to issue new Treasury bills at higher interest rates.\nThis is the crux of Jones' argument. He said on CNBC, \"We are going to be broke really quickly unless we get serious about dealing with our spending issues.\" If the buyers of U.S. Treasury bills ever doubted the U.S. government's ability to pay its debt, they might require higher interest payments, which would likely lead to a big decline in bond prices and a surge in yields. Tudor Jones' prediction echoes a similar call I covered from billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller, who warned of fiscal recklessness and said he is making bets against Treasury bonds.\nCurrent U.S. debt-to-gross domestic product is at 124%. Some experts believe this ratio would be untenable once it reaches 200%. The government could then default on its debt in a way that has not been seen before. Jones said the U.S. will essentially have to inflate itself out of these fiscal issues. His playbook calls for the U.S. to:",

He noted that this cooling is not necessarily a bad thing, as it may be a sign of a more sustainable labor market. Additionally, he mentioned that the housing market is still a concern, with housing inflation running at around a 3% annualized pace, which is contributing to overall inflation.\nIn terms of monetary policy, Powell indicated that the Fed is committed to using its tools to achieve its inflation target of 2%. He noted that the Fed has made progress in reducing inflation but still has work to do. He also stated that the Fed will be monitoring the data closely and will adjust its policy stance as needed to maintain the strength of the economy.\nJamie Dimon: Fed Rate Cut Was Necessary\nIn an interview with CNBC on 29 September, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, discussed the recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, saying that it was a necessary move to adjust to slowing economic growth and decreasing inflation. He notes that the economy is still strong but that there are underlying concerns about inflation and geopolitics that could impact the market. In terms of geopolitics, Dimon expresses concern about the ongoing war in Ukraine and notes that it is likely to get worse. He believes that the US and its allies need to be prepared for a longer war and that more military help will be needed to support Ukraine. Dimon also touches on the topic of the US presidential election, saying that he is not endorsing any candidate at this time and is instead focusing on policy issues that can help both the world and the US.\nWith the Fed's ongoing efforts to balance growth and inflation, the economy appears poised to continue its steady expansion; with that in context, let's take a look at the 7 best cheap stocks to buy today under $10.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile our list of the 7 best cheap stocks to buy today under $10, we used the Finviz and Yahoo stock screeners to find the largest companies with stock prices under $10. From that list, we selected companies that are trading at a forward P/E ratio of under 15, as of October 1. We then narrowed our choices to 7 stocks that were the most widely held by hedge funds.

The company prioritizes high-quality and low-cost gold development projects. Kinross Gold (NYSE:KGC) has a promising pipeline of gold projects that includes the Great Bear project in Ontario, the Manh Choh project in Alaska, and the Lobo-Marte project in Chile, driving its future growth and expansion.\nIn Q2, Kinross Gold (NYSE:KGC) reported a 4% decrease in gold production to 535,300 ounces, primarily due to declines at Tasiast, Paracatu, and La Coipa. However, the company's US operations, including Fort Knox and Round Mountain, showed a production increase. Despite the overall production decline, Kinross Gold\u2019s (NYSE:KGC) revenue rose 10% year-over-year to $1.43 billion, driven by higher gold prices. While all-in-sustaining costs (AISC) increased 7% to $1,387 per ounce, the higher gold price offset the cost increase, resulting in a 40% increase in AISC margins to $955 per ounce.\nKinross Gold\u2019s (NYSE:KGC) focus on low-cost and high-quality gold production has enabled it to generate consistent cash flow. With a realized gold price of $2,342 an ounce, the company's annual operating cash flow potential is over $2 billion. Furthermore, with gold prices trading above $2,500 an ounce, the company's annual free cash flow visibility is over $1.5 billion to $2 billion. This robust free cash flow generation will enable Kinross Gold (NYSE:KGC) to invest in growth initiatives and potentially increase its dividend payout.\nAs of the second quarter, the company\u2019s stock is held by 37 hedge funds, with a total stake valued at $629.88 million.\nOverall KGC ranks 2nd on our list of the best cheap stocks to buy under $10.

        "full_text": "While investors had grown prickly in recent weeks on signs of wavering economic momentum in the US, a disappointing jobs print on Friday appeared to kick concerns over the soft-landing narrative into overdrive. A few general observations:\n-\nThe newly hawkish bias of the Bank of Japan (BOJ) stands in sharp contrast with the dovish leanings of other central banks like the Federal Reserve, and has caused the yen to strengthen. The abrupt repricing of fed funds rate expectations following the weak jobs report last week supercharged this move and served as a lighting bolt to the carry trade. The generationally low valuation of the yen made it highly elastic to this sort of change in relative expectations.\n-\nJapan's Nikkei 225 shed more than 12% on Monday, its biggest one-day decline since the Black Monday crash in October 1987.1 The Japanese equity market, in our view, is arguably undervalued relative to cash flows and assets. Japanese policy makers face tough choices unwinding their extremely accommodative monetary and fiscal policy settings; while this risk may be better priced following recent market drawdowns, the path forward will be a function of unpredictable policy evolution and geopolitical developments.\n-\nBig tech names were another hard-hit segment, with the Magnificent Seven at one point having shed about $750 billion in market capitalization; yet, this cohort remains sharply higher year to date.2 Earnings reports over the past few weeks generally have been underwhelming, and investors who have bid up the prices of these stocks for several years now may be growing impatient for tangible results from massive AI-related expenditures. That said, equity markets overall appear to merely have corrected from overbought levels; we have not seen the type of drawdown that would suggest a seasoned bear market.\n-\nThere is usually a tight relationship between equity market implied volatility and high yield credit spreads. In this selloff, however, equity market volatility spiked considerably more than credit spreads.3 This suggests to us that there are either technical pressures leading the equity volatility market to be oversold, or that equity volatility markets (along with the yield curve) are signaling recession risk that will ultimately be reflected in higher credit spreads. Either way, the risk-reward in high yield credit has become relatively less attractive, in our view.\n-\nAs we have seen in previous incidents when liquidity first begins to get tight, the yen and US Treasuries rallied, the CBOE Volatility Index spiked and the gold price eased. Perhaps this is not surprising given short-term interest rates at cyclical highs in absolute terms and relative to softening wage inflation.4\nIn the view of the Global Value team, certain exposures like cash, gold and more defensive sectors like consumer stapleswhile not immune to market drawdownsmay provide some element of resilience compared with tech-heavy, broad market aggregates. We believe today's shock market move is a good reminder of the importance of respecting the inherent uncertainty of markets by investing in resilient assets.\nSoft US Jobs Report Reverberates Globally\nFor some time now, market sentiment has appeared to be closely tied to expectations around the Fed's ability to engineer a soft landing for the US economy. Friday's job report appeared to flip a switch in the prevailing narrative and serve as a catalyst for Monday's sharp selloff, but it's not the first sign of economic fade we've seen this summer. Despite a range of economic data from PMI reports to loan activity to consumer balance sheetssuggesting heightened cyclical risk, markets have been pricing in a soft landing and continued earnings growth.\nTraders now expect a 50 basis point cut in the federal funds rate at each of the central bank's next two meetings in September and November, and another nearly 50 basis points in December.5 However, Fed officialsincluding Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee on Mondayhave rushed to caution against overreacting to one month's numbers.6 Indeed, the Fed will get another set of labor market data before the September meeting, and there are reasons to believe the hurricane that hit Texas may have impacted the July readings. Another bad report in August, however, likely would cause the Fed to act aggressively come September. Current market volatility is unlikely to prompt an inter-meeting cut by the Fed, as it is well aware that repricing was to be expected in certain markets where valuations appeared stretched.\nBank of Japan Charts Its Own Course\nOn July 31, the BOJ raised its policy target rate to 0.25%, the highest level since 2008, and presented a comprehensive plan for quantitative tightening. The BOJ also indicated that it would issue a series of hikes to bring policy rates toward neutral, assuming its forecasts are being met; this suggests rates in Japan could exceed the pre-global financial crisis peak of 0.5% and highlights the significant changes taking place in Japan's economy and policy settings.7\nShrinking interest-rate differentials as a hawkish BOJ contrasts with the dovish leanings of other central banks like the Fed exerted upward pressure on the yen, which was exacerbated by the swift repricing of fed funds rate expectations following the soft jobs report last week. The yen rally has been further supported by traders unwinding their carry trades (i.e., where investors borrow money in economies with low interest rates to finance investment in higher-yielding areas).\nMarkets no longer expect additional BOJ rate hikes in 2024. In our view, it makes sense for the BOJ to be more cautious given the currency and equity volatility, as well as growing concerns about the health of the US economy. However, reading the minutes of July's BOJ meeting, officials appear to believe that a durable, virtuous cycle between wages and inflation is developing; once market volatility subsides, it would make sense to expect a gradual tightening in policy by the BOJ next year.8 We continue to believe the yen is undervalued and would expect it to appreciate over the medium term, though nearer-term moves are more difficult to forecast given sensitivity to developments in the US.\nSelloff Highlights the Importance of Building Resilience from the Bottom Up\nMarkets feel more rationally priced today than they felt a few weeks ago, but it would be unwise to assume things only can get better from here; we've long observed that markets can deliver a lot of pain to a lot of participants before arriving at fair prices. This is among the reasons why the Global Value team spends far less time obsessing over the macroeconomic and political variables that drive short-term performance than we do seeking opportunities in quality businesses that we believe can demonstrate resilience across multiple states of the world.\nAssets promising growth have been assigned premium valuations by the market for some time now, but the market may start to value potential resilience should the investment backdrop remain volatileif the soft-landing scenario fails to play out, or sovereign debt concerns promote a broad repricing of government paper, or if any one of the global military hotspots ignites into broader conflict. Resilience has traded at a premium in the past; in our view, there's no reason to believe it won't do so again under the right circumstances.\nAll comments are as of August 5, 2024.\n1.

It's a worry for markets.\nThe market signal, called a yield curve, has been upside down since early July 2022, with investors getting less to lock up their money for longer periods than they are for shorter durations. The benchmark U.S. curve shows yields on 2-year Treasuries are about 30 basis points higher than 10-year bonds.\nIn the past, yield curves typically become right-side up as an economic slowdown leads the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, bringing down yields on near-term bonds that are sensitive to policy rates, a phenomenon called bull steepening.\nThis time around, though, it is starting to look like the curve may normalize because longer-term bond yields would rise in a bear steepening, interviews with half a dozen investors and other market experts show. That is due to pressure on longer-term rates from increasing U.S. debt, while a surprisingly robust economy and sticky inflation keep the Fed from cutting rates.\nA bear steepening, which briefly reared its head in October, could resume at some point this year, leading the yield curve back to normal through a rarely trodden path.\n\"What we saw in the later stages of 2023 was the beginning of that curve normalization,\" said Dan Siluk, a portfolio manager at Janus Henderson. \"We'll get a continuation of that theme through the back end of 2024.\"\nBoth the shape of the curve and the reasons for its steepening have important implications for the real economy and Wall Street. The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds would have to rise above 5% for the curve to normalize, the investors estimated, which raises interest costs of businesses and consumers. Inflation would remain sticky in a bear-steepening scenario.\nWhile a normal yield curve is good for banks, a bear steepening would be hard to trade and pressure stocks, leading possibly to market swings.\nMoreover, the normalization of the curve would not mean the economy had dodged a recession. Higher long-term rates could make an eventual slowdown more likely, and a high debt load would hamper the government's ability to respond.\n\"It's too early to dismiss this as a false signal,\" said Campbell Harvey, a Duke University professor who first proposed the inverted yield curve as a recession indicator. \"It is negative that long-term rates go up.\"\nHarvey pointed out that the time it takes for a downturn to manifest after inversion varies, and that in the four most recent inversions the curve turned positive before a recession started.\nINCHING HIGHER\nTo be sure, a bull steepening could also still happen. High policy rates could still slow down the economy, weaken the labor market and hurt consumers, leading the Fed to cut rates. High interest rates could also cause a market ruction, like a banking crisis, that forces the Fed to lower rates.\nBut investors said absent that, conditions were building up for a bear steepening. If growth and inflation persist, it would suggest the long-run equilibrium interest rate for the economy, called the neutral rate, is higher, putting pressure on yields. And the immense amount of debt the U.S. government is taking on would eventually lead investors to charge more for it.\nThere are some signs of investor worries in markets. A New York Fed model that breaks down Treasury yields into its components shows the premium investors charge for lending money over time has been inching up once again.\nThe term premium had turned positive during the October bear steepening, but fell into negative territory later that year as the Fed pivoted to guiding the market on lower rates. It turned positive again this month, most recently on April 24.\nAnother indicator of the broader concern: the price of gold and bitcoin.\nPramol Dhawan, head of Pimco's emerging markets portfolio management, attributed an increase in the price of gold over its fair value due to demand from official institutions for safe-haven assets.\nThat would reduce buyers of Treasuries even as supply increases.\nHARD TO PREDICT\nWhat is not clear, though, is when these concerns will become front and center for markets, which are more focused on the Fed rate outlook at the moment.\nAn event like the UK\u2019s debt crisis of autumn 2022 is hard to predict, although investors said they were watching for spending plans of both U.S. political parties as the November election approaches.\nBNY Mellon strategist John Velis said they were concerned about the Treasury Department's August refunding announcement, in which it lays out the borrowing needs for the quarter. The one before that on May 1 is of less concern as tax receipts would have lessened the need for funding through the summer.\nMore likely, a bear steepening would be a slow process with uncertain timing. That, however, makes it harder for traders.\nBill Campbell, who heads DoubleLine Capital's global sovereign team, said it is costly to put trades ahead of a bear steepening, so timing becomes important.\nThat is leading macro hedge funds to go in and out of the trade, Campbell said. Investors are also looking at other ways, such as using smaller trade sizes.\n\"You're just trying to find clever ways to put it on,\" Campbell said. \"In the bear steepening scenario, we think it's going to be more of a grind higher.\"\n(Reporting by Paritosh Bansal in New YorkEditing by Matthew Lewis)",

The report also showed the median wage for workers switching jobs jumped 10% on an annual basis after increasing 7.6% in February, a bad sign for inflation.\nBut the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey for the U.S. services industry showed a measure of prices businesses paid for inputs fell to a four-year low, a good inflation sign.\nMSCI's gauge of global stock performance closed up 0.1%, while bond yields retreated. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note's yield fell 1.6 basis points to 4.349% after hitting a four-month high of 4.429%.\nSurvey data such as ISM's have been less useful in gauging the economy than gross domestic product, employment and even retail sales numbers, said Joe LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in New York.\n\"One of the problems is that the survey data have not been particularly accurate,\" he said.\n\"I'm not sure the equity market's reacting to any specific set of data at this point. It just seems to be a constant inflow (of investment) as the market keeps getting excited. One about AI and secondly about the prospects of an Immaculate landing.\"\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.29%, as the ISM data cheered European investors. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 gained 0.11% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.23%, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.11%.\nThe Fed should not cut its benchmark rate until year's end, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told broadcaster CNBC, maintaining his view that policymakers should reduce borrowing costs only once in 2024.\nThe dollar index held near its highest level in more than four months, pinning the yen close to its lowest in decades, though the increased threat of currency intervention by Tokyo capped further declines in the Japanese currency.",

He argued the double whammy of surging demand and limited supply would cause the yellow metal's price to soar.\nPaulson's call proved prescient. The Fed has raised its benchmark rate from nearly zero to north of 5% in a bid to bring down inflation, and the price of gold has jumped from about $1,800 per troy ounce when Paulson touted it in 2021 to record levels above $2,400 in recent weeks.\nBurry correctly predicted inflation and rising rates as well, and appears to share Paulson's view that gold stands to benefit.",

The Company remains debt free with $123.0 million in cash, and the strong operating cash flows are supporting the ramp-up of the AGM as the Company executes its return to hard rock mining operations.\n45% increase in Mineral Reserves at Abore to 485,000 ounces\nThe Company is pleased to report that following a successful infill drilling campaign in 2023 and early 2024, the Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves at the Abore deposit have increased to 11.8 million tonnes (\"Mt\") at a grade of 1.28 grams per tonne (\"g/t\") gold, representing an increase of 151,000 ounces (45%) to 485,000 ounces, effective June 30, 2024, when compared to the report titled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report and Feasibility Study for the Asanko Gold Mine, Ashanti Region, Ghana\" with an effective date of December 31, 2022 (\"2023 Technical Report\").\nThese results, in addition to infill and step out drilling results at other deposits, will be used to update a consolidated AGM Mineral Reserve estimate and an optimized life of mine plan in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nAsanko Gold Mine Q2 highlights (100% basis):\nSubsequent to closing of the transaction with Gold Fields Ltd., the operational and financial results of the AGM have been consolidated into the Company from March 4, 2024 onwards. To enable a comprehensive understanding of the operational performance at the mine asset level, the following highlights for the AGM are presented on a 100% basis for the entire six months ended June 30, 2024.\nSafety: There were no lost-time injuries (\"LTI\"), nor total recordable injuries (\"TRI\"), recorded during Q2. The 12\u2013month rolling LTI and TRI frequency rates as of June 30, 2024 were 0.15 and 0.60 per million employee hours worked, respectively.\nProduction performance: Gold production of 26,437 ounces during Q2 and 56,823 ounces year-to-date. Gold production during Q2 was impacted by challenging ground conditions in the upper portion of the Abore pit and heavy seasonal rainfall in Ghana, which impacted fresh ore delivery to the mill such that a greater proportion of lower grade stockpiles were processed than originally planned. Lower throughput resulting from harder material processed also affected production levels.\nMilling performance: Achieved mill throughput of 1.3 Mt of ore at a grade of 0.7 g/t during Q2, with metallurgical recovery averaging 82%. Mill throughput during Q2 was 9% lower than the first quarter of 2024 due to processing harder ore both mined from Abore and stockpiled material that was previously mined from Nkran. Engineering and early earthworks for the installation of a permanent secondary crusher continued during the quarter and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2025. This circuit upgrade will maintain plant throughout at 5.8 Mtpa when treating harder ore.\nCost performance: Total cash costs1 of $1,271/oz and AISC of $1,759/oz for the three months ended June 30, 2024. Year-to-date AISC1 of $1,777/oz.\nRevised 2024 guidance: Due to the slower than expected ramp-up in mining, coupled with temporary lower mill throughput, the Company is revising full year production guidance from between 140,000 to 160,000 ounces to between 120,000 and 130,000 ounces. Operating costs are estimated to be in line with previous expectations, however AISC1 guidance per gold ounce sold for 2024 is being revised from between $1,600/oz to $1,750/oz to between $1,975/oz and $2,075/oz. This increase is due to lower expected gold production coupled with investments in additional stripping at Abore.\nCash flow generation: Generated positive cash flow from operations of $9.2 million, with Free Cash Flow1 negative at $4.5 million during Q2 due to investments in waste stripping at the Abore deposit.\nFinancial performance: Gold revenue of $63.8 million generated from 27,830 gold ounces sold at an average realized price of $2,292/oz during Q2. Net income of $13.9 million and Adjusted EBITDA1 of $19.3 million during Q2.\n_______________________________ |\n1 Refer to Non-IFRS Performance Measures |\nGaliano Q2 Highlights:\nRobust liquidity: The Company ended the quarter with $123.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and no debt.\nEarnings: Net income of $8.8 million or $0.03 per common share during Q2, which included the consolidation of the AGM's financial results for the three months ended June 30, 2024. Adjusted net income1 for Q2 was $7.3 million or $0.03 per common share.\nSenior management appointment: Appointed Michael Cardinaels as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer (\"COO\"), effective September 3, 2024. The appointment of Mr. Cardinaels as the new Executive Vice President and COO is part of the Company's commitment to operational improvements and its overarching strategy to drive growth at the AGM. Mr. Cardinaels brings over two decades of mining sector experience across various commodities, most recently with Perseus Mining Ltd.\n\"The second quarter of 2024 marked significant progress in advancing mining operations at the Abore deposit, while the Company remained fully funded by operating cash flow,\" said Matt Badylak, Galiano's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"In addition, the 45% increase in Abore's Mineral Reserves highlights the value that we are beginning to realize beyond the 2023 Technical Report, as well as the prospectivity of our tenements. Although 2024 production and costs have been impacted by a slower than expected ramp-up, the growth in Mineral Reserves and resulting investments in stripping during the second quarter will enhance the optimized life of mine plan, resulting in a larger, longer-term net benefit for the Company and its stakeholders.\nAs we continue to generate positive cash flows from operations and maintain a robust balance sheet, Galiano remains uniquely positioned to execute on its strategy to become a leading mid-tier gold producer.\nI am also pleased to be welcoming Michael Cardinaels to the position of Chief Operating Officer at Galiano. Michael has over 20 years of industry experience including significant exposure to mining complex orogenic deposits on the African continent. His technical expertise, energy and enthusiasm will be valued as we continue ramping up production at the AGM.\"\nAsanko Gold Mine \u2013 Summary of quarterly operational and financial highlights (100% basis)\nOperating and financial results are on a 100% basis for all periods presented to enable comparability with prior quarters.\nAsanko Gold Mine (100% basis) | Q2 2024 | Q1 2024 | Q4 2023 | Q3 2023 | Q2 2023 |\nMining | |||||\nOre mined ('000t) | 467 | 265 | 22 | - | - |\nWaste mined ('000t) | 7,427 | 4,877 | 3,415 | - | - |\nTotal mined ('000t) | 7,894 | 5,142 | 3,437 | - | - |\nStrip ratio (W:O) | 15.9 | 18.4 | 155.2 | - | - |\nAverage gold grade mined (g/t) | 1.0 | 0.9 | 0.7 | - | - |\nMining cost ($/t mined) | 2.98 | 3.63 | 4.30 | - | - |\nOre tonnes trucked ('000 t) | 503 | 566 | 657 | 695 | 729 |\nOre transportation cost ($/t trucked) | 5.71 | 6.79 | 6.54 | 6.63 | 5.88 |\nProcessing | |||||\nOre milled ('000t) | 1,336 | 1,467 | 1,486 | 1,573 | 1,457 |\nAverage mill head grade (g/t) | 0.7 | 0.8 | 0.8 | 0.8 | 0.8 |\nAverage recovery rate (%) | 82 | 83 | 84 | 87 | 85 |\nProcessing cost ($/t milled) | 11.18 | 10.55 | 9.94 | 9.69 | 11.01 |\nG&A cost ($/t milled) | 5.13 | 4.74 | 5.55 | 4.16 | 4.68 |\nGold produced (oz) | 26,437 | 30,386 | 31,947 | 35,779 | 33,673 |\nFinancials, costs and cash flow | |||||\nRevenue ($m) | 64.0 | 65.6 | 59.5 | 67.8 | 64.1 |\nGold sold (oz) | 27,830 | 31,840 | 30,555 | 35,522 | 32,912 |\nAverage realized gold price ($/oz) | 2,292 | 2,056 | 1,942 | 1,902 | 1,944 |\nTotal cash costs1 ($/oz) | 1,271 | 1,180 | 1,352 | 1,056 | 1,127 |\nAll-in sustaining costs1 ($/oz) | 1,759 | 1,793 | 2,065 | 1,445 | 1,374 |\nAll-in sustaining margin1 ($/oz) | 533 | 263 | (123) | 457 | 570 |\nAll-in sustaining margin1 ($m) | 14.8 | 8.4 | (3.8) | 16.2 | 18.8 |\nIncome from mine operations ($m) | 23.1 | 23.5 | 8.7 | 23.7 | 24.4 |\nAdjusted net income1 ($m) | 13.9 | 23.5 | 3.7 | 21.3 | 24.4 |\nCash provided by operating activities ($m) | 9.2 | 26.1 | 24.1 | 39.7 | 18.0 |\nFree cash flow1 ($m) | (4.5) | 5.8 | 2.3 | 24.0 | 10.1 |\nAsanko Gold Mine \u2013 Financial and operational highlights for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 (100% basis)\nThe following tables present excerpts of the operating and financial results of the AGM on a 100% basis for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, so performance can be compared with the comparative period in the prior quarter.\nThree months ended June 30, | Six months ended June 30, | |||\n(All amounts in 000's of US dollars, unless otherwise stated) | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |\nAsanko Gold Mine (100% basis) | ||||\nFinancial results | ||||\nRevenue | 63,963 | 64,066 | 129,565 | 129,259 |\nIncome from mine operations | 23,071 | 24,406 | 46,567 | 49,063 |\nNet income | 13,945 | 24,378 | 28,402 | 44,992 |\nAdjusted EBITDA1 | 19,279 | 25,541 | 40,792 | 48,404 |\nCash generated from operating activities | 9,231 | 17,979 | 35,336 | 36,922 |\nFree cash flow1 | (4,509) | 10,113 | 1,304 | 22,072 |\nAISC margin ($ per gold ounce sold)1 | 533 | 570 | 389 | 577 |\nOperating results | ||||\nGold produced (ounces) | 26,437 | 33,673 | 56,823 | 66,351 |\nGold sold (ounces) | 27,830 | 32,912 | 59,670 | 68,086 |\nAverage realized gold price ($/oz) | 2,292 | 1,944 | 2,166 | 1,896 |\nTotal cash costs ($ per gold ounce sold)1 | 1,271 | 1,127 | 1,222 | 1,104 |\nAISC ($ per gold ounce sold)1 | 1,759 | 1,374 | 1,777 | 1,319 |\nThe AGM produced 26,437 ounces of gold during Q2 2024, as the processing plant achieved milling throughput of 1.3 Mt of ore at a grade of 0.7 g/t with metallurgical recovery averaging 82%. Mill feed for the quarter was sourced primarily from existing stockpiled ore with a blend of mined Abore material. Milling rates during Q2 were impacted by harder ore from Abore and Nkran stockpiles. The Company is in the process of installing a permanent secondary crushing circuit, which is anticipated to maintain plant throughput when treating harder ore at design capacity of 5.8 Mtpa once completed in the first half of 2025.\nSold 27,830 ounces of gold in Q2 2024 at an average realized gold price of $2,292/oz for total revenue of $64.0 million (including $0.2 million of by-product silver revenue), in line with Q2 2023 revenue. Revenue was flat quarter-on-quarter as an 18% increase in realized gold prices relative to Q2 2023 was largely offset by a 15% reduction in sales volumes.\nIncome from mine operations for Q2 2024 totaled $23.1 million, comparable with $24.4 million in Q2 2023.\nReported Adjusted EBITDA1 of $19.3 million in Q2 2024 compared to $25.5 million in Q2 2023. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA1 was driven by the decrease in income from mine operations, higher payments made to mining contractors and a $2.9 million realized loss on gold hedging instruments.\nTotal cash costs1 in Q2 2024 amounted to $1,271/oz compared to $1,127/oz in Q2 2023. The increase in total cash costs1 was primarily driven by lower gold sales volumes, which decreased by 15% in Q2 2024 and had the effect of increasing fixed costs on a per ounce basis. Additionally, operational waste stripping costs at Abore contributed to the higher total cash costs1 in Q2 2024.\nAISC1 for Q2 2024 was $1,759/oz compared to $1,374/oz in the comparative period. AISC1 was higher in the current quarter predominately due to the increase in total cash costs per ounce1 described above, 15% fewer gold ounces sold and higher capitalized stripping costs at Abore. Additionally, payments to mining services contractors were $146/oz higher in Q2 2024.\nThe AGM generated $9.2 million of cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow1 of negative $4.5 million during Q2 2024. This compares to $18.0 million of cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow1 of $10.1 million during Q2 2023. The decrease in free cash flow1 was primarily due to investments in waste stripping at the expanded Abore deposit, partly offset by higher realized gold prices during Q2 2024.\nAbore Mineral Reserve Estimate as of June 30, 2024\nProven | Probable | Proven + Probable | |||||||\nTonnes | Grade | Au Contained | Tonnes | Grade | Au Contained | Tonnes | Grade | Au Contained | |\nDeposit | (Mt) | (g/t) | (koz) | (Mt) | (g/t) | (koz) | (Mt) | (g/t) | (koz) |\nAbore | - | - | - | 11.8 | 1.28 | 485 | 11.8 | 1.28 | 485 |\nNotes on Abore Mineral Reserve Estimate:\nMr. Richard Miller, P.Eng., Vice President Technical Services for Galiano Gold Inc., is the Qualified Person responsible for the Abore Mineral Reserve statement.\nRefer to the Company's news release dated April 16, 2024 for Abore's Mineral Resource Estimate as of March 31, 2024.\nAbore Mineral Reserves are reported assuming a gold price of US$1,650/oz Au.\nAbore Mineral Reserves are reported at 0.50 g/t Au cut-off.\nThe overall strip ratio (the amount of waste mined for each tonne of ore) is 7.2:1.\nProcessing recovery is 0.10 g/t tails grade and capped at 94.0%.\nThe average mining dilution is calculated to be 6.9%.\nA 6.8% ore loss has been applied to the Mineral Reserve estimate.\nThe Mineral Reserve is stated as diluted dry metric tonnes.\nAll other Mineral Reserves of the AGM remain as previously stated, except stockpiles which have been restated for depletion.\nThe increase to the Abore Mineral Reserve estimate is not considered a material change to Galiano.\nGaliano Gold Inc. \u2013 Financial highlights for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023\nThree months ended June 30, | Six months ended June 30, | |||\n(All amounts in 000's of US dollars, unless otherwise stated) | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |\nGaliano Gold Inc. | ||||\nRevenue | 63,963 | - | 95,658 | - |\nIncome from mine operations | 25,132 | - | 29,778 | - |\nNet income | 8,831 | 11,961 | 4,072 | 20,454 |\nNet income per share attributable to | 0.03 | 0.05 | 0.02 | 0.09 |\nAdjusted net income1 | 7,264 | 11,961 | 13,757 | 20,454 |\nAdjusted net income per share attributable to | 0.03 | 0.05 | 0.06 | 0.09 |\nAdjusted EBITDA1 | 17,598 | 9,634 | 21,105 | 16,374 |\nCash and cash equivalents | 123,039 | 55,503 | 123,039 | 55,503 |\nCash generated from (used in) operating activities | 4,463 | (1,377) | 17,491 | (1,920) |\nThe Company consolidated the financial results of the AGM commencing on March 4, 2024. As revenue and income from mine operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 relate to the financial results of the AGM, refer to the discussion above on the AGM's financial results for the quarter.\nThe Company reported net income of $8.8 million in Q2 2024 compared to net income of $12.0 million in Q2 2023. The decrease in net earnings during Q2 2024 was due to a $2.1 million increase in share-based compensation expense resulting from an increase in the fair value of cash\u2013settled long\u2013term incentive plan awards linked to the Company's share price, and $1.4 million in accretion expense and fair value adjustments on the deferred and contingent consideration payable to Gold Fields associated with the Company's acquisition of Gold Fields' 45% interest in the AGM.\nAdjusted EBITDA1 for Q2 2024 amounted to $17.6 million, compared to $9.6 million in Q2 2023. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA1 was due to consolidating the financial results of the AGM from March 4, 2024 onwards; whereas, in the prior quarter the Company only recognized its 45% share of the AGM's Adjusted EBITDA1.\nCash generated from operating activities in Q2 2024 was $4.5 million, compared to cash used in operating activities of $1.4 million in Q2 2023. The increase in cash generated from operating activities in Q2 2024 was driven by the consolidation of the AGM's cash flows effective March 4, 2024.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $123.0 million and no debt.\nThis news release should be read in conjunction with Galiano's Management's Discussion and Analysis and the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, which are available at www.galianogold.com and filed on SEDAR+. |\n1 Non-IFRS Performance Measures\nThe Company has included certain non-IFRS performance measures in this news release. These non-IFRS performance measures do not have any standardized meaning and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Accordingly, these performance measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Refer to the Non-IFRS Measures section of Galiano's Management's Discussion and Analysis for an explanation of these measures and reconciliations to the Company's and the AGM's reported financial results in accordance with IFRS.\nTotal Cash Costs per Gold Ounce\nManagement of the Company uses total cash costs per gold ounce sold to monitor the operating performance of the AGM. Total cash costs include the cost of production, adjusted for share-based compensation expense, by-product revenue and production royalties per ounce of gold sold.All-in Sustaining Costs per Gold Ounce and All-in Sustaining Margin\nThe Company has adopted the reporting of \"AISC per gold ounce sold\" as per the World Gold Council's guidance. AISC include total cash costs, AGM general and administrative expenses, sustaining capital expenditure, sustaining capitalized stripping costs, reclamation cost accretion and lease payments made to and interest expense on the AGM's mining and service lease agreements per ounce of gold sold. All-in sustaining margin is calculated by taking the average realized gold price for a period less that period's AISC.EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA provides an indication of the Company's continuing capacity to generate income from operations before taking into account the Company's financing decisions and costs of amortizing capital assets. Accordingly, EBITDA comprises net income excluding interest expense, interest income, amortization and depletion, and income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA adjusts EBITDA to exclude non-recurring items and to include the Company's interest in the Adjusted EBITDA of the AGM joint venture for the period from January 1, 2024 to March 3, 2024. Other companies may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently.Free cash flow\nThe Company believes that in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, the Company and certain investors and analysts use free cash flow to evaluate the AGM's performance with respect to its operating cash flow capacity to meet non-discretionary outflows of cash. The presentation of free cash flow is not meant to be a substitute for the cash flow information presented in accordance with IFRS, but rather should be evaluated in conjunction with such IFRS measures. Free cash flow is calculated as cash flows from operating activities of the AGM adjusted for cash flows associated with sustaining and non-sustaining capital expenditures and payments made to mining and service contractors for leases capitalized under IFRS 16.Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per common share\nThe Company has included the non-IFRS performance measures of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per common share. Neither adjusted net income nor adjusted net income per share have any standardized meaning and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to other measures presented by other issuers. Adjusted net income excludes certain non-cash items or non-recurring items from net income or net loss to provide a measure which helps the Company and investors to evaluate the results of the underlying core operations of the Company or the AGM and its ability to generate cash flows and is an important indicator of the strength of the Company's or the AGM's operations and performance of its core business.\nQualified Person\nRichard Miller, P.Eng., Vice President Technical Services with Galiano, is a Qualified Person as defined by Canadian National Instrument 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, and has approved the scientific and technical information contained in this news release.\nAbout Galiano Gold Inc.\nGaliano is focused on creating a sustainable business capable of value creation for all stakeholders through production, exploration and disciplined deployment of its financial resources.

        "summary": "These countries are among the biggest gold consumers Gold has been a desirable commodity for thousands of years, dating back to ancient civilization. In Rome, Julius Caesar gifted 200 gold coins to each of his soldiers to celebrate their victory against Gaul. Gold production and consumption have grown continually through modern times. In fact, most gold worldwide\u2014more than 90%\u2014has been mined since the mid-1800s California Gold Rush. Today, gold is used broadly across industries from dentistry to electronics, where its durability and conductivity make it well suited for wiring and plating.

        "full_text": "These countries are among the biggest gold consumers\nGold has been a desirable commodity for thousands of years, dating back to ancient civilization.\nIn Rome, Julius Caesar gifted 200 gold coins to each of his soldiers to celebrate their victory against Gaul. Gold production and consumption have grown continually through modern times. In fact, most gold worldwide\u2014more than 90%\u2014has been mined since the mid-1800s California Gold Rush.\nToday, gold is used broadly across industries from dentistry to electronics, where its durability and conductivity make it well suited for wiring and plating. Individuals worldwide also continue to invest in gold, collecting it in various forms: from bars and coins to jewelry. According to World Gold Council data, buyers purchased more than 3,200 metric tonnes of gold in 2023, and the average price per ounce set a new record: $1,940.54, an 8% increase from the previous year.\nSD Bullion used data from the World Gold Council to break down gold consumption per capita, identifying the countries with the greatest consumer demand. Keep reading to learn more about how this demand has changed in recent years and the different ways people invest in this precious metal.\nConsumer demand has fallen over the past decade\nConsumer demand for gold has declined globally for the past decade, so U.S. consumption ranks well below smaller, wealthier countries like the United Arab Emirates, Switzerland, and Kuwait. Rising gold prices and economic change\u2014including significant cost of living increases\u2014have impacted both the jewelry market and consumer investments internationally in bars and coins. Central banks, however, kept a \u201chistoric pace\u201d in 2023, continuing to build their reserves by purchasing large amounts of gold.\nWhile overall demand is reduced, gold remains a popular investment in many countries where unique regional factors contribute to greater interest. In China, for example, buyers are investing in gold at younger ages than ever before. Trends favoring traditional Chinese elements in jewelry contributed to a 16% increase in gold consumption in the first half of 2023. Comparatively, investors from the UAE preferred buying gold bars and coins in 2023. Viewing these purchases as stable investments that would yield better returns, demand for the year equaled 11 tonnes\u2014a 34% increase from 2022.\nHow people buy gold\nJewelry is more than just an expression of style or a status symbol, it is the most popular form of gold for investors in countries around the globe. Many younger people in China choose to purchase gold because of its stable, long-lasting value rather than attempt fluctuating investments in stocks or real estate.",

GOLD has been incessantly trading above the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) since June 18, 2024. The stock also eclipsed its 50-day SMA on Aug. 8, 2024. Notably, the 50-day SMA continues to read higher than the 200-day moving average since the golden crossover on April 29, 2024, indicating a bullish trend.\nGOLD Trades Above 50-Day SMA\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nKey Projects to Underpin Production Growth for GOLD\nBarrick is well-placed to benefit from the progress in key growth projects that should significantly contribute to its production. Its major gold and copper growth projects, including Goldrush, the Pueblo Viejo plant expansion and mine life extension, Donlin Gold, Fourmile, Lumwana Super Pit and Reko Diq, are currently in execution.\nThese projects are advancing per schedule as well as within budget, underpinning the next generation of profitable production. The restart of the Porgera mine would offer a further upside, supporting the company\u2019s planned production ramp-up through 2024.\nThe recently commissioned Goldrush mine is ramping up to a targeted 400,000 ounces of production per annum by 2028. Bordering Goldrush is the 100% Barrick-owned Fourmile, which is yielding grades double those of Goldrush and is anticipated to become another Tier One mine. The Reko Diq copper-gold project in Pakistan is designed to produce 400,000 tons of copper and 500,000 ounces of gold annually in its second development phase. In Zambia, the Lumwana Super Pit project is set to double the mine\u2019s production over a mine life of more than 30 years.\nGOLD recently stated that the feasibility study for the expansion of its Lumwana mine is expected to be completed by the end of this year, with construction slated to commence in 2025. The expansion includes doubling throughput by twinning the existing process circuit and significantly increasing mining volumes. It could transform the mine into a long-life, high-yielding operation, placing it among the top 25 global copper producers and achieving Tier One copper mine status.\nSurging Gold Prices to Drive Barrick\u2019s Margins and Cash Flow\nRallying gold prices should translate into strong profit margins and free cash flow generation. Gold prices are hitting record highs this year, and the yellow metal has been among the best-performing assets. Gold has rallied roughly 29% this year, driven by strong demand from central banks, a dovish Fed interest rate outlook, global uncertainties and a surge in safe-haven demand thanks to geopolitical tensions. The recent rally in gold prices has been driven by the 50-basis-point cut in interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Gold scaled a record high of $2,685.42 per ounce on Sept. 26, 2024, on the U.S. interest rate cut and growing expectations of another reduction in November, which have weighed on the U.S. dollar. Increased tensions in the Middle East arising from the Israel and Hezbollah conflict also fueled safe-haven demand. Iran\u2019s recent missile attack on Israel has raised risks of a wider conflict in the Middle East.\nGOLD\u2019s Strong Liquidity & Attractive Dividend Bode Well\nBarrick has a robust liquidity position and generates healthy cash flows, which position it well to take advantage of attractive development, exploration and acquisition opportunities, as well as drive shareholder value and reduce debt. At the end of the second quarter of 2024, Barrick\u2019s cash and cash equivalents were around $4 billion. It also generated an operating cash flow of $1.16 billion and a free cash flow of $340 million.\nGOLD offers a healthy dividend yield of 2% at the current stock price. Its payout ratio is 39% (a ratio below 60% is a good indicator that the dividend will be sustainable), with a five-year annualized dividend growth rate of 17.3%.\nHigher Production Costs Weigh on Barrick Stock\nGOLD is hamstrung by higher costs, which may eat into its margins. Its cash costs per ounce and all-in-sustaining costs (AISC) \u2014 the most important cost metric of miners \u2014 increased significantly in 2023 due to lower production and sales volumes, along with unplanned costs and changes in the sales mix across different mine sites. In the second quarter, cash costs per ounce of gold increased around 10% year over year, while AISC rose roughly 11%. GOLD projects total cash costs per ounce of $940-$1,020 and AISC of $1,320-$1,420 per ounce for 2024, which indicates a year-over-year increase at the midpoint of the respective ranges. Increased mine-site sustaining capital spending and potentially steeper energy costs may lead to higher costs this year.\nGOLD\u2019s Earnings Estimates Moving Higher\nEarnings estimates for Barrick have been going up over the past 60 days, reflecting analysts\u2019 optimism. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 and 2025 have been revised upward over the same time frame.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for 2024 is currently pegged at $1.26, suggesting year-over-year growth of 50%. Earnings are also expected to register a 34.4% growth in 2025.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nHow Should Investors Play the GOLD Stock?\nBarrick\u2019s growth initiatives, actions to boost production, solid financial health and bullish technicals paint a promising picture. A healthy growth trajectory, rising earnings estimates and a safe dividend yield are the other positives. Rallying gold prices should also boost GOLD\u2019s profitability and drive cash flow generation. Despite GOLD\u2019s attractive valuation and upbeat growth prospects, its high production costs warrant caution.

Has It Worked?\nNew York City Paid $2 Million for Empty Hotel Rooms Meant for Migrants\nThe potential for a flurry of mergers and acquisitions in the world\u2019s biggest gold producer after China and Russia has been one of the major talking points at the three-day Diggers & Dealers Mining Forum in the dusty Western Australian mining town of Kalgoorlie.\nWith the hunt for new Australian reserves at a four-year low, mainly due to surging costs for labor and equipment, many bigger miners think the best way to expand is \u201cthrough M&A \u2014 because it\u2019s not really happening through exploration,\u201d said Paul Early, the co-head of energy resources and sustainability at Sydney-based advisor Barrenjoey Markets Pty.\n\u201cCommodity prices are strong, and particularly so in gold,\u201d he said on the sidelines of the conference. \u201cBoards feel comfortable, shareholders generally are supportive \u2014 those are the conditions that trigger deal-making.\u201d\nThose conditions helped pave the way for the sector\u2019s biggest ever takeover \u2014 the almost-$15 billion purchase of Australia\u2019s Newcrest Mining Ltd. by US giant Newmont Corp. completed late last year.\nWhile that\u2019s so far been an outlier, with the number of deals globally on a downward trend in recent years, the time now seems ripe for smaller producers to be targeted, according to Simon Lawson, the chief executive officer of Perth-based explorer and developer Spartan Resources Ltd.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a smorgasbord,\u201d Lawson, who last month saw rival Ramelius Resources Ltd. double its shareholding in Spartan, said at the conference. \u201cIf you\u2019re producing and have got the cash, there is just a huge opportunity to roll up a bunch of junior explorers and developers.\u201d\nGold prices are up around 16% this year, setting successive records, as buying by central banks and Chinese consumers, heightened geopolitical risks and US monetary policy all powered the rally. The Federal Reserve is expected to finally pull the trigger on its much anticipated pivot to rate cuts next month, which should help maintain momentum.\nThat\u2019s helped to renew interest in the sector, marking a sharp contrast from recent years that were characterized by miners being hit by rising inflation and operational challenges, and missed production targets.\nIn efforts to appease shareholders, explorers have erred on the side of caution when it comes to pursuing growth \u2014 opting instead to prioritize cost-cutting. That\u2019s effectively put deal-making on the back-burner.\nNow, with greenfield exploration lagging despite gold prices that would normally spur increased spending on drilling programs, and capital-raising proving difficult as investors chase energy transition metals like lithium and copper, the backdrop is starting to tip in favor of gold M&A.\nMajor Australian companies including Northern Star Resources Ltd. and Ramelius are reporting stronger cash flows this year as easing inflation hints at incoming relief for producers.\nStill, the stock prices of most gold miners are lagging the rally in spot prices. The ratio between the FTSE Gold Mines Index and the MSCI All-Country World gauge remains considerably lower than previous peaks as bullion has rallied \u2014 an indication that stocks are cheap.\nYet if bullion prices, currently near $2,400 an ounce, keep rising those valuations would likely increase, potentially making deals more expensive. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. this week maintained a $2,700 price target for gold in 2025.\nFor now, the industry remains positive over the likelihood of future deals. Tim McCormack, an analyst at financier Canaccord Genuity Inc., identified potential Australian gold miner targets as Gold Road Resources Ltd., De Grey Mining Ltd., Bellevue Gold Ltd., and Ora Banda Mining Ltd.\n\u201cYou look around the global landscape of the majors, and even the bigger Aussies, all of them are craving growth,\u201d he said at the conference.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nMade-in-China Goes Upscale as a New Generation of Brands Battles Slowdown\nRetailers Locked Up Their Products\u2014and Broke Shopping in America\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

The impact of these measures has created an optimistic outlook for the market, potentially setting the stage for continued growth in the coming months.\nThe third quarter proved to be the strongest for Canada's main stock market, thanks to a combination of domestic rate cuts and rebounding global markets. Economies around the world showed signs of recovery, improving investor sentiment and benefiting Canadian equities. Financial and technology stocks were among the biggest contributors to the market\u2019s positive performance, with financial stocks gaining 10% and tech stocks up by 12% during the quarter, according to data from Reuters.\nThis strong performance was driven by key players in the industry, highlighting the potential of Canadian financial and tech stocks. The financial sector also saw significant gains, supported by the large weight of financials in the Canadian index, which amplified the impact of rate relief on credit performance. The recovery was further bolstered by strong earnings reports and a pivot towards rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which lent additional support to the Canadian market.\nThe impressive performance of Canadian stocks can be attributed to a combination of domestic and global factors. Analysts noted that the Bank of Canada\u2019s rate cuts had a revitalizing effect on the real estate market, which in turn bolstered financial services stocks. Jimmy Jean, a prominent economist, pointed out that the expectation of additional rate cuts created a favorable environment for the real estate sector, allowing it to lead the market recovery.\nFurthermore, the Canadian stock market benefited from a broader global recovery, as investor sentiment improved in tandem with solid earnings reports from international markets. In this context, Canada emerged as one of the best-performing markets worldwide in the third quarter, following a period of underperformance in the second quarter.\nAs the outlook for the remainder of the year unfolds, analysts anticipate that if the Bank of Canada continues its rate-cutting strategy, the positive momentum could persist. Lower mortgage rates are expected to alleviate borrowing costs for households, stimulating demand for housing and further strengthening the real estate and financial sectors. However, challenges remain, particularly in light of geopolitical tensions that could impact oil prices and the energy sector. Despite these concerns, the overall sentiment surrounding Canadian equities remains cautiously optimistic, with a focus on identifying undervalued stocks poised for growth in this evolving market landscape.\nWith these factors in mind, this article delves into the seven most undervalued Canadian stocks that analysts recommend for investors seeking opportunities in this recovering market.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we used the Finviz stock screener to identify all the companies operating out of Canada with a forward Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of less than 15 as of October 7, 2024. We then reviewed the price targets set by analysts for each stock and compared them to their respective closing prices on October 7 to evaluate the upside potential. Additionally, we analyzed data from approximately 912 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey during the second quarter of 2024 to assess hedge fund ownership of each company. The stocks are ranked in ascending order based on their upside potential.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA man, dressed in protective gear, holding a golden nugget freshly extracted from an underground mining shaft.\nTRX Gold Corporation (NYSE:TRX), based in Oakville, Canada, is engaged in the exploration, development, and production of gold properties in the United Republic of Tanzania. The company\u2019s primary asset is the Buckreef Gold Project, which includes a Special Mining License covering 16.04 square kilometers and 12 Prospecting Licenses spanning 98.19 square kilometers in north-central Tanzania. Formerly known as Tanzanian Gold Corporation, the company rebranded to TRX Gold Corporation (NYSE:TRX) in May 2022 to align with its expanded operations and strategic focus.\nIn Q3 2024, TRX Gold Corporation (NYSE:TRX) delivered a strong financial performance, showcasing significant revenue growth and improved gold production. The company reported revenues of over $10 million for the quarter, contributing to a year-to-date figure of around $30 million. The gross profit margin for Q3 2024 stood at approximately 43%, demonstrating robust operational efficiency. Year-to-date gross margins also remained strong at over 40%, highlighting TRX Gold\u2019s ability to manage costs effectively despite increased production activities.\nA key highlight from the earnings call was TRX Gold Corporation (NYSE:TRX) ability to ramp up production to nearly 1,900 tonnes per day, a substantial 116% increase compared to the previous quarter. This surge in production capacity resulted from the successful commissioning of the company\u2019s 2,000 tonnes-per-day processing plant, which was expanded on time and within budget. The expansion was funded entirely through internally generated cash flow, preventing any dilution of shareholder value.\nThe company\u2019s liquidity position remains healthy, with just under $8 million in cash and a debt-free balance sheet. This solid financial footing enables TRX Gold to explore further operational expansions and pursue strategic investments to optimize gold recovery rates. TRX Gold Corporation (NYSE:TRX) also benefits from favorable realized gold prices, with year-to-date prices averaging $2,300 per ounce and recent sales fetching as high as $2,460 per ounce.\nDespite the rising operating costs due to higher mining expenses, TRX Gold Corporation (NYSE:TRX) remains focused on optimizing throughput and recovery rates to enhance profitability. The company\u2019s transition from oxides to sulfide ores presents some challenges, but ongoing evaluations and potential investments in advanced milling technology are expected to mitigate these issues. With strong financial performance, operational expansion, and a solid liquidity position, TRX Gold Corporation (NYSE:TRX) is well-positioned for future growth, making it one of the most undervalued Canadian stocks to consider for investment according to analysts.\nOverall TRX ranks 2nd on our list of the most undervalued Canadian stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of TRX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TRX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.",

In the past year, investors globally have sought secure avenues, such as those provided by Silver Bullion, to protect their wealth, leading to a substantial increase in the volume of stored precious metals.\nMoreover, the surge in gold prices, reaching historic highs in recent months, has further bolstered the overall value of assets entrusted to The Safe House's protection. Raising the insurance coverage now also better prepares the company for the increased demand in storage volume that comes with precious metal bull markets.\nJohn Tay, Director of The Safe House, said, \"Bullion stored within The Safe House\u2019s vaults are always fully insured. We prioritize the safety and security of our clients' assets above all else and continuously increase insurance coverage as the assets under storage grow. Our comprehensive all-risk insurance coverage, which includes protection against third-party theft, fire, terrorism and sabotage, employee infidelity, and mysterious disappearance, underscores our dedication to providing security and peace of mind to our customers.\"\nVergel Villasoto, Director of Silver Bullion, said, \"From our experience of past gold and silver bull markets, investor interest in bullion rise in tandem as prices trend upwards toward the peak. Our decision to raise the insured amount, even beyond the current stored precious metal value, is also driven by our anticipation of a resumption of the next leg in the bull market in gold and silver. While gold has reached historic highs, silver has yet to follow suit. However, historical data suggests that silver tends to lag behind gold in the initial phases of precious metal bull markets, with silver eventually outperforming gold.

The average mining rate during the fourth quarter was 28,955 tonnes per day with a strip ratio of 0.43. The average grade of ore processed during the fourth quarter was 0.73 g/t gold, in line with plan. Gold sold during the fourth quarter 2023 totaled 31,300 ounces. Tonnes of waste mined remained lower than planned during the quarter as the Company awaited receipt of permits from the Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources (known as \"SEMARNAT\") for access to certain areas of the pit. Fourth quarter cash costs and AISC totaled $536 and $802 per ounce of gold sold, respectively. AISC in the fourth quarter was impacted by higher sustaining capital related to the timing of execution of planned and unplanned projects.\nExploration and Projects Update\nIn the fourth quarter, exploration efforts were concentrated on drilling activities at Camino Rojo in Mexico and South Railroad in Nevada, US. Throughout 2023, drilling totaled 77,955 metres, with a focus on these key projects. In early 2024, Orla released multiple press releases highlighting the results of exploration activities from the second half of 2023 at the Camino Rojo and South Railroad projects.\nCamino Rojo Exploration Update (Mexico)\nIn 2023, a comprehensive drilling program at Camino Rojo covered a total of 57,715 metres, with 37,677 metres allocated to infill and extension drilling on the Sulphides deposit, 6,503 metres drilled on the near-mine oxide extension, and 13,535 metres dedicated to regional exploration aimed at uncovering new satellite discoveries.\nFollowing positive results from the 2023 Sulphides Extension drill program, exploration efforts in 2024 will shift from infill drilling of the Caracol-hosted Sulphides to focus on assessing the extensions of the Camino Rojo deposit, referenced below. The Company will also continue to advance underground resources estimation and advance the economic evaluation of the Caracol-hosted mineralization.\nHigh grade poly-metallic gold-silver-zinc intersections continue to support potential for Camino Rojo Sulphides Extensions\nOrla has confirmed and discovered new sulphide mineralization extending beyond the established open pit mineral resource boundaries at Camino Rojo. This drilling and mineralization is building on an updated geological model and the success of the previously reported CRSX22-15C hole drilled 200 metres down-plunge from the existing resources.\nThe highly positive intercepts, both historical and recent, justified the execution of a new drill section in the second half 2023, targeting 450 metres down-plunge from the existing resources, along the dike zone structure. This significant step-out drilling initiative consisted of drilling 2,400 metres, targeting the area around the positive historical intercept in hole CR12-366D (15.7 g/t Au, 29.0 g/t Ag, 0.73% Zn, 0.10 % Pb, 0.08% Cu (19.6 g/t AuEq) over 4.5 metres. This new drill section confirmed the presence of significant polymetallic semi-massive to massive sulphide replacement mineralization.\nInitial metallurgical testing on polymetallic sulphide mineralization material from CRSX-22-07 and CRSX-22-08C were positive with high gold recovery reported in both CIL bottle roll tests between 81-96% and rougher flotation on the CRSX-22-07 material produced a gold concentrate with 85-88% gold recovery. Open-circuit zinc cleaner tests on material from CRSX-22-07 produced a zinc concentrate with zinc grades of 52% and over 85% zinc recovery. These results suggest this new style of mineralization may be amenable to both standard cyanide processing and flotation. Orla plans to further explore these promising results through additional metallurgical test work in 2024.\nFor additional details, please see press releases dated February 22, 2024 (Orla Mining Discovers New Style of Sulphide Mineralization at Camino Rojo Extending 0.5km Beyond Current Resources), and June 22, 2023 (Orla Mining Provides Update on Successful Drilling Program in Mexico).\nNear mine oxide layback drilling seeking to confirm mineralization with targeted mineral resource addition\nThe Company completed drilling in the oxide pit layback to confirm and delineate mineralization on the Fresnillo property, located immediately north of and adjacent to the Camino Rojo Oxide Mine open pit. Results from the 2,503-metre layback drill program were positive and as expected and are included in the 2023 year-end mineral resource and mineral reserve estimate update set forth in the Company's annual information form for the year ended December 31, 2023. Additionally, 4,000 metres of drilling was performed, with encouraging results, targeting the extension of oxide gold mineralization hosted by key structures controlling oxide mineralization within and beyond the currently designed oxide open pit.\nSouth Railroad Exploration Update (Nevada, US)\nOrla completed 14,695 metres of drilling in the first full year of exploration at South Railroad, following the acquisition of the project in August 2022. The exploration objectives at South Railroad are to upgrade and grow resources at satellite deposits and drill test multiple targets for new discovery. During the second half of 2023, exploration focused on infill drilling to support upgrading resources at the North Bullion deposit, testing the pit extension potential of the Dark Star and Pinion deposits, and testing exploration targets across the South Railroad Project.\nInitial results released on March 7, 2024 demonstrated that the Company has extended oxide gold mineralization at the Pinion and Dark Star deposits outside of the current projected open pits. Meanwhile, infill drill results met expectations, confirming robust oxide mineralization within projected pits, while supplying material for new metallurgical column test work to further optimize the planned development project.\nSubsequent to quarter end, the Company announced on February 26, 2024, the acquisition of Contact Gold Corp. (\"Contact\"). Contact's key asset is the 100%-owned Pony Creek property, a 4,500 hectare exploration land package, strategically located adjacent to Orla's South Railroad property in the southern part of the Carlin trend in Nevada. Contact also owns the Green Springs property located in the southern end of the Cortez trend. Under the terms of the proposed transaction, each holder of Contact shares will receive, for each Contact share held, 0.0063 of an Orla common share, representing a total purchase price of approximately US$8.1 million. It is anticipated that the transaction with Contact will close in the second quarter of 2024.\nAn additional release of results related to the North Bullion deposit and other regional targets, as well as exploration plans for 2024, will be released in the coming weeks.\nFull drill results are available at www.orlamining.com.\nPanama Update\nIn November 2023, the National Assembly of Panama passed Law 407 that included a moratorium on granting, renewing, or extending concessions for the exploration, extraction, or exploitation of metal mining in Panama. On December 15, 2023, Minera Cerro Quema, S.A. (\"MCQSA\"), the Company's subsidiary that holds the Cerro Quema Project, received three resolutions from MICI. The resolutions rejected the request for extension for the three mining concessions comprising the Cerro Quema Project, retroactively declared the concessions canceled, and declared the area comprising the concessions to be a reserve area under the Panamanian mining code. Under the Panamanian mining code, MICI is prohibited from granting mining concessions for exploration or extraction on a reserve area. On December 26, 2023, MCQSA filed requests for reconsideration of MICI's decisions. On March 11, 2024, MICI rejected the requests for reconsideration. For further details, please see the Orla's press release dated December 18, 2023, Orla Mining Provides Update on Panama and the Cerro Quema Project.\nThe Company is exploring all legal remedies available to protect its historical investments and potentially unlock additional value for its stakeholders in respect of the Cerro Quema Project. The Company intends to file a Notice of Intent to Arbitrate under the FTA. The Notice of Intent facilitates consultations between the Government of Panama and the Company. In the event that such consultations are unsuccessful, the Company expects to proceed to file a Request for Arbitration. Although the Company intends to pursue these legal remedies, the Company's preference is an amicable resolution with the Government of Panama that results in a positive outcome for all stakeholders.\nIn light of these events, the Company has evaluated the facts, circumstances, and the significant uncertainties associated with mining in Panama. Orla took a prudent approach and did not include any estimated future cash flows from activities involving the exploration, extraction, or exploitation of metal mining since these activities were legally prohibited as at December 31, 2023. As a result, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $72.4 million at the Cerro Quema Project during the year ended December 31, 2023. The estimated recoverable amount of $10.0 million relates to the value of land ownership and possession rights in Panama, which the Company acquired with a view to developing the project. This impairment has been taken without prejudice to, or without at present attributing any specific value to, the legal remedies that may be obtained through any arbitration proceedings or otherwise.\n2024 Guidance\nAs set forth in the Company's January 16, 2024 news release, gold production from the Camino Rojo Oxide Mine is expected to be 110,000 to 120,000 ounces in 2024. The Company is planning to mine approximately 8.3 million tonnes of ore and 9.9 million tonnes of waste for a total of 18.2 million tonnes mined resulting in a waste to ore strip ratio of 1.20. The increased strip ratio in 2024 is a result of increased waste mining planned for the east-west pit expansion following the receipt of applicable permits.\nGold Production | Oz | 110,000 \u2013 120,000 |\nTotal Cash Cost (net of by-product) | $/oz au sold | $625 - $725 |\nAll-in sustaining cost (\"AISC\") | $/oz au sold | $875 - $975 |\nCapital Expenditures | $m | $31.0 |\nSustaining capital expenditures | $m | $18.0 |\nPP&E / Leases | $17.5 | |\nExploration \u2013 capitalized | $0.5 | |\nNon-sustaining capital expenditures | $m | $13.0 |\nProjects | $2.0 | |\nExploration \u2013 capitalized\n| $11.0\n| |\nExploration Expenses & Project Development (expensed) | $m | $31.0 |\nCorporate G&A (inclusive of share-based compensation) | $m | $19.0 |\n1. AISC is a non-GAAP measure. See the \"Non-GAAP Measures\" section of this news release for additional information. |\n2. Exchange rates used to forecast cost metrics include MXN/USD of 18.0 and CAD/USD of 1.33. A +/-1.0 change to the MXN/USD exchange rate would have an impact of +/-$10/oz on AISC. |\nCamino Rojo's 2024 total cash cost is expected to be in a range of $625 to $725 per ounce of gold sold, including royalties and net of changes in inventory, while sustaining capital expenditures are expected to total $18.0 million, of which $12.5 million is for the planned heap leach pad expansion (phase 2) which is scheduled for the first half of 2024 and $0.5 million is for capitalized exploration on the Camino Rojo oxide layback. About half of the annual sustaining capital is expected to be spent in the first quarter 2024, which will result in a higher AISC for the period. Non-sustaining capital is expected to total $13.0 million in 2024 with $11.0 million related to the Camino Rojo Extension exploration. AISC for 2024 is expected to be in the range of $875 to $975 per ounce of gold sold. The higher AISC guidance range in 2024 versus 2023 is predominantly a result of increased waste stripping at Camino Rojo (~$85/oz) and sustaining capital related to the heap leach pad expansion (~$110/oz).\nIncome tax expense during 2024, including Mexican Special Mining Duty, is expected to range between $35.0 and $40.0 million. The Company pays income tax in monthly instalments, with a final annual true-up in March upon filing its year-end tax returns. The Special Mining Duty related to 2023 totals $9.1 million and is expected to be paid in March of this year.\nFinancial Statements\nOrla's audited financial statements and management's discussion and analysis for the year ended December 31, 2023, are available on the Company's website at www.orlamining.com, and under the Company's profiles on SEDAR+ and EDGAR.\nQualified Persons Statement\nThe scientific and technical information in this news release was reviewed and approved by Mr. J. Andrew Cormier, P. Eng., Chief Operating Officer of the Company, and Mr. Sylvain Guerard, P. Geo., Senior Vice President, Exploration of the Company, who are the Qualified Persons as defined under NI 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.\nFourth Quarter 2023 Conference Call\nOrla will host a conference call on Wednesday, March 20, 2024, at 10:00 AM, Eastern Time, to provide a corporate update following the release of its financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and year ended 2023:\nDial-In Numbers / Webcast:\nConference ID: | 5844017 |\nToll Free: | 1 (888) 550-5302 |\nToll: | 1 (646) 960-0685 |\nWebcast: |\nAbout Orla Mining Ltd.\nOrla's corporate strategy is to acquire, develop, and operate mineral properties where the Company's expertise can substantially increase stakeholder value. The Company has two material gold projects: (1) Camino Rojo, located in Zacatecas State, Mexico and (2) South Railroad, located in Nevada, United States. Orla is operating the Camino Rojo Oxide Gold Mine, a gold and silver open-pit and heap leach mine. Orla is also developing the South Railroad Project, a feasibility-stage, open pit, heap leach gold project located on the Carlin trend in Nevada. The property is 100% owned by Orla and covers over 160,000 hectares which contains a large oxide and sulphide mineral resource. Orla also owns 100% of Cerro Quema located in Panama which includes a pre-feasibility-stage, open-pit, heap leach gold project and a copper-gold sulphide resource. The technical reports for the Company's material projects are available on Orla's website at www.orlamining.com, and on SEDAR+ and EDGAR under the Company's profile at www.sedarplus.ca and www.sec.gov, respectively.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nThe Company has included certain performance measures in this news release which are not specified, defined, or determined under generally accepted accounting principles (in the Company's case, International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"\")). These are common performance measures in the gold mining industry, but because they do not have any mandated standardized definitions, they may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Accordingly, the Company uses such measures to provide additional information and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). In this section, all currency figures in tables are in thousands, except per-share and per-ounce amounts.\nAverage Realized Gold Price\nAverage realized gold price per ounce sold is calculated by dividing gold sales proceeds received by the Company for the relevant period by the ounces of gold sold. The Company believes the measure is useful in understanding the gold price realized by the Company throughout the period.\nAVERAGE REALIZED GOLD PRICE | Q4 2023 | Q4 2022 | 2023 | 2022 | |\nRevenue | $ 62,946 | $ 56,758 | $ 233,643 | $ 193,230 | |\nSilver sales | (1,166) | (229) | (2,688) | (836) | |\nGold sales | 61,780 | 56,529 | 230,955 | 192,394 | |\nOunces of gold sold | 31,300 | 32,438 | 118,993 | 107,502 | |\nAVERAGE REALIZED GOLD PRICE | $ 1,974 | $ 1,743 | $ 1,941 | $ 1,790 | |\nNet Cash (Debt)\nNet cash (debt) is calculated as cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments less total debt adjusted for unamortized deferred financing charges at the end of the reporting period. This measure is used by management to measure the Company's debt leverage. The Company believes that in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, net debt is useful to evaluate the Company's leverage and is also a key metric in determining the cost of debt.\nNET CASH (DEBT) | Dec 31, 2023 | Dec 31, 2022 |\nCash and cash equivalents | $ 96,632 | $ 96,278 |\nLess: Current portion of long term debt | \u2014 | (45,000) |\nLess: Long term debt | (88,350) | (100,795) |\nNET CASH (DEBT) | $ 8,282 | $ (49,517) |\nAdjusted Earnings and Adjusted Earnings per share\nAdjusted earnings excludes deferred taxes, unrealized foreign exchange, changes in fair values of financial instruments, impairments and reversals due to net realizable values, restructuring and severance, and other items which are significant but not reflective of the underlying operational performance of the Company. The Company believes these measures are useful to market participants because they are important indicators of the strength of operations and the performance of the core business. With the addition of performance share units (\"PSUs\") at the end of Q1 2023, the Company expects greater volatility in share-based payments expense going forward. Accordingly, the effect of these PSUs in the calculation of adjusted earnings was excluded.\nADJUSTED EARNINGS | Q4 2023 | Q4 2022 | 2023 | 2022 | |\nNet income (loss) for the period | $ (58,442) | $ 18,690 | $ (27,010) | $ 45,770 | |\nImpairment and derecognition of exploration properties | 72,743 | \u2014 | 72,743 | \u2014 | |\nUnrealized foreign exchange | 1,300 | 1,971 | (843) | (1,862) | |\nLoss on extinguishment of credit facility | \u2014 | \u2014 | 1,547 | 13,219 | |\nAccretion on deferred revenue | 123 | \u2014 | 676 | \u2014 | |\nShare based compensation related to PSUs | (22) | \u2014 | 121 | \u2014 | |\nOther | \u2014 | \u2014 | 517 | \u2014 | |\nADJUSTED EARNINGS | $ 15,702 | $ 20,661 | $ 47,751 | $ 57,127 | |\nMillions of shares outstanding \u2013 basic | 314.5 | 304.5 | 311.5 | 272.2 | |\nAdjusted earnings per share \u2013 basic | $ 0.05 | $ 0.07 | $ 0.15 | $ 0.21 | |\nCompanies may choose to expense or capitalize their exploration expenditures. The Company expenses exploration costs based on its accounting policy. To assist the reader in comparing against those companies which capitalize their exploration costs, please note that included within Orla's net income (loss) for each period are exploration costs which were expensed, as follows:\nQ4 2023 | Q4 2022 | 2023 | 2022 | ||\nExploration & evaluation expense | $ 9,316 | $ 5,605 | $ 34,616 | $ 18,939 | |\nFree Cash Flow\nThe Company believes market participants use Free Cash Flow to evaluate the Company's operating cash flow capacity to meet non-discretionary outflows of cash. Free Cash Flow is not meant to be a substitute for the cash flow information presented in accordance with IFRS. Free Cash Flow is calculated as the sum of cash flow from operating activities and cash flow from investing activities, excluding certain unusual transactions.\nFREE CASH FLOW | Q4 2023 | Q4 2022 | 2023 | 2022 | |\nCash flow from operating activities | $ 21,903 | $ 31,836 | $ 65,296 | $ 95,311 | |\nCash flow from investing activities | (30,062) | (20,188) | (41,728) | (13,356) | |\nFREE CASH FLOW | $ (8,159) | $ 11,648 | $ 23,568 | $ 81,955 | |\nMillions of shares outstanding \u2013 basic | 314.5 | 304.5 | 311.5 | 272.2 | |\nFree cash flow per share \u2013 basic | $ (0.03) | $ 0.04 | $ 0.08 | $ 0.30 | |\nCash Costs and All-In Sustaining Costs\nThe Company calculates cash cost per ounce by dividing the sum of operating costs and royalty costs, net of by-product silver credits, by ounces of gold sold. Management believes that this measure is useful to market participants in assessing operating performance.\nThe Company has provided an AISC performance measure that reflects all the expenditures that are required to produce an ounce of gold from operations.

Except as required by the securities disclosure laws and regulations applicable to the Company, the Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements if management's beliefs, estimates or opinions, or other factors, should change.\nCautionary Note to U.S. Readers\nThis news release has been prepared in accordance with Canadian standards for the reporting of mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates, which differ from the previous and current standards of the United States securities laws. In particular, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the terms \"mineral reserve\", \"proven mineral reserve\", \"probable mineral reserve\", \"inferred mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\", \"measured mineral resources\" and \"mineral resources\" used or referenced in this news release are Canadian mineral disclosure terms as defined in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 \u2013 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\") and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the \"CIM\") \u2013 CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council, as amended (the \"CIM Definition Standards\").\nFor United States reporting purposes, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") has adopted amendments to its disclosure rules (the \"SEC Modernization Rules\") to modernize the mining property disclosure requirements for issuers whose securities are registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The SEC Modernization Rules more closely align the SEC's disclosure requirements and policies for mining properties with current industry and global regulatory practices and standards, including NI 43-101, and replace the historical property disclosure requirements for mining registrants that were included in Industry Guide 7 under the U.S. Securities Act. As a foreign private issuer that is eligible to file reports with the SEC pursuant to the multijurisdictional disclosure system, the Company is not required to provide disclosure on its mineral properties under the SEC Modernization Rules and provides disclosure under NI 43-101 and the CIM Definition Standards. Accordingly, mineral reserve and mineral resource information contained in this news release may not be comparable to similar information disclosed by United States companies.\nAs a result of the adoption of the SEC Modernization Rules, the SEC now recognizes estimates of \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources.\" In addition, the SEC has amended its definitions of \"proven mineral reserves\" and \"probable mineral reserves\" to be \"substantially similar\" to the corresponding CIM Definition Standards that are required under NI 43-101. While the above terms are \"substantially similar\" to CIM Definition Standards, there are differences in the definitions under the SEC Modernization Rules and the CIM Definition Standards. There is no assurance any mineral reserves or mineral resources that the Company may report as \"proven mineral reserves\", \"probable mineral reserves\", \"measured mineral resources\", \"indicated mineral resources\" and \"inferred mineral resources\" under NI 43-101 would be the same had the Company prepared the reserve or resource estimates under the standards adopted under the SEC Modernization Rules or under the prior standards of Industry Guide 7. Accordingly, information contained in this news release may not be comparable to similar information made public by U.S. companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements under the United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nSOURCE Orla Mining Ltd.\nView original content to download multimedia: http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/March2024/19/c5333.html",

Should You Buy Them?\nThere has been an increased interest in gold and silver as investments, mainly due to recent inflation and economic uncertainty. And Costco is getting in on the action.\nIn fact, it might surprise you to learn that Costco now sells between $100 million and $200 million worth of gold and silver per month, according to estimates by Wells Fargo. The retailer is currently offering one-ounce gold coins for sale.\nBut should you buy gold from Costco if you can fit the purchase into your budget? In this article, we'll dive into the gold coins Costco is selling, how the discount retailer's prices compare to the competition, and whether gold should be a part of your investment strategy.\nCostco's gold coins\nCostco is selling 2024 1 oz American Eagle Gold Coins, which are produced by the U.S. Mint and contain one ounce of pure gold.\nAs of this writing, Costco is selling these coins for $2,469.99 each. It is limiting purchases to one transaction per membership, and up to five gold coins can be bought in that single transaction. It's also worth noting a few things:\nThe price could change by the time you're reading this if the spot price of gold fluctuates.\nCostco doesn't apply any sort of price adjustments to gold coins.\nCostco clearly states on its website that this price includes shipping and handling, and that the gold coins might be available in person for a lower price, since Costco won't have the expense of making sure they're delivered safely.\nCostco's price per ounce vs. current gold prices\nWith those prices in mind, consider that the spot (market) price of gold at the same time was about $2,406 per ounce. So, you're paying about $64 more than the current market value for one ounce of gold.\nHaving said that, Costco's prices are quite low compared with other ways to buy the same gold coins. You'll always pay more for a U.S. Mint-produced gold coin than you would for a one-ounce bar of gold because of the coin's value as a collectible. For comparison, major precious metals exchange APMEX charges $2,532.59 (as of this writing) for one 2024 1 oz American Eagle Gold Coin, which includes shipping.\nIs gold a good investment?\nThe short answer is that it depends on what you mean by \"investment.\" Gold can be a good way to store value and protect against economic crashes, but it is unlikely to deliver comparable performance to the stock market over time. For example, since 2010 gold has increased in value by 91% through April 19. That might sound like solid performance, until you learn that the S&P 500 produced a return of 484% in the same period.\nLegendary investor Warren Buffett once explained why he doesn't think of gold as a great investment.\nIn short, he classifies gold as an \"unproductive asset.\" It doesn't produce anything of value (like a business would) and it doesn't generate income (like dividend stocks do). Other than making jewelry -- which a very small percentage of gold is actually used for -- it has little practical utility. Its value is simply based on what someone else is willing to pay for it.\nThe bottom line\nGold can be an excellent store of value and could work as a hedge against inflation. And to be fair, it's certainly a better investment than most purchases I've made at Costco. Its value also tends to hold up well in uncertain times and market crashes. The bottom line is that buying some of Costco's gold coins could be a smart idea, but it's important to realize that it doesn't replace a smart long-term investment strategy.\nAlert: our top-rated cash back card now has 0% intro APR until 2025\nThis credit card is not just good \u2013 it\u2019s so exceptional that our experts use it personally.

Welcome to our weekly market wrap, where we take a look back at these last five trading days with a focus on the market news, economic data and headlines that had the most impact on gold prices and other key correlated assets\u2014 and may continue to into the future.\nGold prices have rebounded aggressively after last week\u2019s first decline in nearly a month, rallying to major gains this week and even briefly meeting new all-time highs.\nSo, what kind of week has it been?\nIn what feels like a return to historical norms, a week of trading that has been demarcated by a broad risk-off shift in financial markets and particularly turbulent waters in US equity markets has also been a week of strong, even record-breaking performance for gold prices. Over the first two days of trading, a deeper sense of unease settled into markets as investors looked ahead to Wednesday\u2019s FOMC announcements and the July Jobs Report posting Friday. As a rocky week of headlines and quarterly reporting drove instability in the US stock market\u2014 especially in a number of dominant tech-focused sectors\u2014 gold prices stabilized following a poor showing last week, tentatively stepping back above $2415/oz and then finding steady support to hold that line. There seemed to be two sentiments aiding the yellow metal. On one hand, growing expectations that we have moved just around the corner from the Federal Reserve\u2019s first interest rate hike; on the other, a still-creeping concern that recent economic data may be indicating the central bankers have left it a bit too late to avoid turbulence in the US economy under the more restrictive financial conditions.\nThe announcement made by the FOMC at the close of their August meeting (with only three remaining this year) was not by any means a surprise: No change to key policy rates, an indication that we are near to that event, but also a reiteration that timing of the next move is \u201cdata dependent.\u201d Over Tuesday night and into the early pre-market hours in New York, traders and investors had mostly pre-positioned for this news based on the consensus projections and mood. As a result, with equity markets continuing to stutter, gold prices made their way comfortably to $2425 by lunchtime as markets awaited the Fed. Having already made strong gains, it was a bit surprising to see the yellow metal rocket higher again with the release of the committee\u2019s consensus statement, picking up more than $20/oz within the hour and maintaining a strong hold on that level through the rest of the day.\nGiven that lack of true surprise from Jerome Powell & Company, there was some consideration as to whether a (relatively) quieter Thursday session would see an unwinding of the Fed Day moves. Before that could play out in US trading\u2014 the precious metal held steady through Asian and early European hours\u2014 markets were hit with more unsettling macroeconomic data as the ISM Manufacturing Index surveyed an unexpected decline in industrial activity and was preceded by the highest number weekly Initial Jobless Claims in nearly a year. While gold spot marginally softened as some took their profits off the top of Wednesday\u2019s rally, prices remained supported by the thrum of discomfort and uncertainty these Thursday data points amplified in the markets and never looked likely to fall below $2440/oz for long.",

But in Bank of America's view, copper is also the epicenter of the energy transition, and will further benefit as artificial intelligence data centers expand.\nIt is a similar story for cocoa, as droughts and bad harvests have rocketed the ingredient to records. Over the past 12 months, cocoa futures have gained 256%, and a metric ton costs a record $10,900.",

This is expected to have been driven by the uptrend in gold prices throughout the quarter and higher production levels.\nStay up-to-date with all quarterly releases: See Zacks Earnings Calendar.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Idaho Strategics\u2019 earnings for the third quarter is pegged at 21 cents per share, suggesting a substantial improvement from the 3 cents reported in the third quarter of 2023. The estimate has moved up 5% over the past 60 days.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe consensus estimate for IDR\u2019s revenues is pegged at $7.40 million, indicating a 124% surge from the year-ago quarter's actual.\nIdaho Strategic\u2019s Earnings Surprise History\nIDR\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimates in three of the trailing four quarters but missed in one. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 116.55%, on average. The trend is shown in the chart below.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nWhat the Zacks Model Unveils for IDR Stock\nOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Idaho Strategic this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that is not the case here.\nEarnings ESP: IDR has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\nZacks Rank: The company currently flaunts a Zacks Rank of 1. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nFactors Likely to Have Shaped Idaho Strategic\u2019s Q3 Performance\nIDR has delivered solid results so far in 2024, with first-half revenues rising 82.8% and earnings surging 325% year over year. The company produced 6,019 ounces of gold in the first half of 2024, which marked a 55% jump from 3,877 ounces in the first half of 2023. This momentum is expected to have continued throughout the third quarter of 2024 as mining on the H-Vein progresses.\nGold prices averaged $2,491 per ounce in the third quarter, up 29% from the prior-year level. Throughout the quarter, gold prices have been fueled by increasing expectations of interest rate cuts and rising tensions in the Middle East. The Fed\u2019s announcement of a 50-basis-point rate cut at the Sept. 17-Sept. 18 meeting lifted gold prices, which ended the quarter at above 2,600 per ounce.\nHigher gold prices and production levels are expected to have boosted the company\u2019s revenues in the third quarter.\nHowever, drilling activity at the company\u2019s Golden Chest Mine is expected to have increased exploration expenses in the quarter from the prior year- quarter. Meanwhile, increase in production is anticipated to have resulted in lower cash costs. Improved efficiencies are also expected to have benefitted IDR\u2019s earnings in the third quarter.\nIDR\u2019s Price Performance & Valuation\nShares of Idaho Strategic have surged 220.9% in a year, way ahead of the industry's 48.4% growth. In comparison, the Zacks Basic Materials sector and the S&P 500 have rallied 15.8% and 39%, respectively, in the same period.\nIDR\u2019s Price Performance Against Industry & Broader Market\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe company has also outscored major gold miners like Barrick Gold GOLD and Newmont\u2019s NEM gains of 25.9% and 23.6%, respectively.\nThe IDR stock is currently trading at a forward sales multiple of 8.09, well above the industry average of 2.97.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nInvestment Thesis on Idaho Strategic\nWith a strong cash flow and low debt, IDR is well-equipped to invest in existing mines while exploring and developing gold and rare earth element (REE) prospects. It recently announced the discovery of Red Star Vein during a drill program at its Golden Chest mine, indicating growth potential.\nGold prices have gained 34% year to date and are currently at $2,780 per ounce, gaining on safe-haven demand amid uncertainty surrounding the U.S. election and rising tensions in the Middle East. Gold demand has been robust, driven by safe-haven investment, central bank purchases, and increasing use in sectors like energy and healthcare. The favorable environment for gold presents a promising outlook for IDR.\nDemand for REEs is rising due to their critical role in clean energy technologies, and given China\u2019s dominance in the market, the United States has heightened its focus on developing domestic REE capabilities. IDR is taking steps to capitalize on this opportunity.\nShould You Buy IDR Stock Right Now?\nIdaho Strategic is likely to deliver solid year-over-year improvement in revenues and earnings in the to-be-reported quarter, aided by higher gold prices and production, which could further boost the stock. IDR offers investors the stability of profitable gold production and the added benefit of diversification through its exposure to REE elements. Despite its expensive valuation, IDR is a great stock to add to one\u2019s portfolio to benefit from the solid long-term fundamentals of the gold and REE markets. Idaho Strategic currently flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 and has a VGM Score of B.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

While that\u2019s not ideal for a central bank trying to get close to its 2% target, the CPI was not a shocker to Wall Street traders dreading another post-inflation rout.\n\u201cAnother hotter-than-expected CPI reading may breathe new life into the sticky inflation narrative, but whether it actually delays rate cuts is a different story,\u201d said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. \u201cSticky doesn\u2019t necessarily mean overheating.\u201d\nThe S&P 500 closed around 5,175. Tech led gains on Tuesday, with Oracle Corp. soaring 12% amid cloud revenue growth. Nvidia Corp. rallied over 7%. Boeing Co.\u2019s losses in 2024 approached 30%. Treasuries remained lower after a $39 billion sale of 10-year notes and a growing slate of new corporate bonds.\nFor a glimpse on how anxiety was running high before Tuesday\u2019s CPI print, the options market provided some clues.\nTraders were more concerned about a potentially big S&P 500 move post-CPI than they were about the Fed\u2019s rate decision next week, according to Citigroup Inc. analysts.\nAfter closing at its highest since October, the Cboe One-Day Volatility Index \u2014 a measure of cost in S&P 500 options with maturities of no more than 24 hours \u2014 fell sharply on Tuesday. The more famous 30-day volatility index known as the VIX also retreated after the inflation data.\nNow the relative sense of calm in the face of a strong inflation print was unusual. In fact, the advance in stocks marked a break from how stocks have traded on CPI days since the Fed started lifting rates.\nAn S&P 500 move of 1% or more has only happened on a handful of occasions on the day of the CPI release since March 2022. Most of the time, however, gains were on the back of lower \u2014 not higher \u2014 core inflation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s proving difficult to see what may stop the market\u2019s momentum, as earnings, inflation, and interest rates are moving in the right direction,\u201d said Skyler Weinand at Regan Capital.\nThe S&P 500 will deliver stronger-than-expected earnings in 2024, powered by resilient economic growth and artificial intelligence breakthroughs, according to Bank of America Corp. strategists \u2014 who are now among Wall Street\u2019s most bullish profit forecasters.\nThe team including Ohsung Kwon and Savita Subramanian raised their earnings-per-share estimate to $250 from $235, tying with BMO Capital Markets and Deutsche Bank AG for the most optimistic outlook among strategists tracked by Bloomberg.\nSubramanian last week raised her S&P 500 target to 5,400.\nAs a flurry of forecasters bump up their optimism toward US stocks in lockstep, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Mike Wilson won\u2019t budge, arguing he sees no justification to upgrade his outlook given an absence of broad earnings growth.\nThe strategist stuck to his year-end S&P 500 forecast of 4,500 in an interview on Tuesday with Bloomberg Surveillance Radio, even as a growing list of peers at firms including Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and UBS Group AG have raised projections for the benchmark.\n\u201cA lot of folks have raised their price targets because of higher multiples,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWe\u2019re not willing to do that.\u201d\nThe stock market may be rallying, but the yield curve remains inverted \u2014 which suggests that there are plenty of investors who are still concerned about economic conditions this year, according to Weinand at Regan Capital.\n\u201cWhile a recession would naturally steepen out the yield curve to positive territory, we think the yield curve can steepen this year without a recession,\u201d he noted. \u201cInvestors will eventually realize that we can achieve a soft landing and that sentiment shift can push 10-year Treasury bond yields back above 2-year Treasury bond yields.\u201d\nThe Fed is widely expected to hold interest rates steady for a fifth straight meeting when policymakers gather March 19-20. Much of the focus by investors will be on the Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s quarterly forecasts for rates, including whether fresh employment and inflation figures have prompted any changes.\nTo Bret Kenwell at eToro, regardless of whether the inflation print is ideal, investors mostly want to know whether they can count on what\u2019s expected \u2014 and right now, that\u2019s for a June rate cut.\nCorporate Highlights:\n3M Co. named aerospace veteran William Brown as its new chief executive officer, a move aimed at providing fresh direction for a company mired in mounting legal liabilities and a much-diminished stock price.\nBoeing Co.\u2019s aircraft deliveries trailed rival Airbus SE\u2019s last month as the US planemaker dealt with the growing fallout from an early-January accident that has since plunged the company into crisis.\nUnited Airlines Holdings Inc. has told Boeing to stop building 737 Max 10 jets for the carrier, opting to switch to a smaller variant and the rival Airbus SE A321 until the US planemaker can pull the stretched single-aisle through its long-delayed certification.\nSouthwest Airlines Co. plans to cut capacity this year, halt most hiring and review its spending plans in response to reduced aircraft deliveries from Boeing Co., the planemaker facing regulatory and criminal investigations in the wake of a near-catastrophic accident in January.\nKohl\u2019s Corp. reported same-store sales in the fourth quarter that missed the average analyst estimate, suggesting the department store chain struggled to attract shoppers during the crucial holiday shopping season.\nKey events this week:\nEurozone industrial production, Wednesday\nECB Governing Council member Yannis Stournaras speaks, Wednesday\nVolkswagen, Adidas earnings, Wednesday\nUS PPI, retail sales, initial jobless claims, business inventories, Thursday\nChina property prices, Friday\nJapan\u2019s largest union federation announces results of annual wage negotiations, just ahead of Bank of Japan policy meeting, Friday\nBank of England issues inflation survey, Friday\nUS industrial production, University of Michigan consumer sentiment, Empire Manufacturing, Friday\nSome of the main moves in markets:\nStocks\nThe S&P 500 rose 1.1% as of 4 p.m. New York time\nThe Nasdaq 100 rose 1.5%\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6%\nThe MSCI World index rose 0.9%\nCurrencies\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changed\nThe euro was unchanged at $1.0926\nThe British pound fell 0.2% to $1.2794\nThe Japanese yen fell 0.5% to 147.68 per dollar\nCryptocurrencies\nBitcoin fell 1% to $71,389.82\nEther fell 1.3% to $3,980.55\nBonds\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries advanced six basis points to 4.15%\nGermany\u2019s 10-year yield advanced three basis points to 2.33%\nBritain\u2019s 10-year yield declined three basis points to 3.95%\nCommodities\nWest Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.2% to $77.79 a barrel\nSpot gold fell 1.2% to $2,156.94 an ounce\nThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.\n--With assistance from Lu Wang, Felice Maranz, David Marino, Tatiana Darie, Michael Mackenzie and Ye Xie.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nGold-Medalist Coders Build an AI That Can Do Their Job for Them\nAcademics Question ESG Studies That Helped Fuel Investing Boom\nLuxury Postnatal Retreats Draw Affluent Parents Around the US\nPrimaries Show Candidates Can Win on TikTok But Lose at the Polls\nHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never Built\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

The decrease in both periods was primarily due to higher production and slightly lower unit costs for key consumables, including energy and fuel.\n-\nAll-in sustaining costs(1) (\"AISC\"): $1,207 per ounce sold in Q4 2023 and $1,220 per ounce sold in 2023, within the tightened guidance range for the year, and lower than $1,246 per ounce sold in Q4 2022 and $1,276 per ounce sold in 2022. Decreases in both periods primarily reflect the decrease in cash operating costs per ounce sold, partially offset by higher royalties due to higher metal prices. The decrease in the year was also due to lower sustaining capital expenditures.\n-\nTotal capital expenditures: $128.6 million in Q4 2023, and $401.9 million in 2023, including $52.5 million and $153.8 million of growth capital(1) invested at our Skouries project in the respective periods. Growth capital at the operating mines of $121.1 million in 2023 was primarily focused at Kisladag, including waste stripping to support mine life extension, construction of the first phase of the North Heap Leach Pad (\"NHLP\"), and upgraded higher-capacity conveyors. Sustaining capital at operating mines(1) totaled $121.8 million in 2023, including $72.7 million at Lamaque primarily related to underground development, equipment rebuilds, and expansion of the tailings management facility.\nFinancial\n-\nRevenue: $306.9 million in Q4 2023 an increase of 25% from revenue of $246.2 million in Q4 2022, and $1,008.5 million in 2023, an increase of 16% from revenue of $872.0 million in 2022, both due to higher average realized gold prices and higher volumes sold.\n-\nNet cash generated from operating activities of continuing operations: $159.6 million in Q4 2023, an increase from $96.2 million in Q4 2022, and $382.9 million in 2023, an increase from $211.2 million in 2022. Increases in both periods were due to higher revenue, lower unit operating costs, lower income taxes paid, and lower mine standby costs.\n-\nCash flow from operating activities, before changes in working capital(2): $138.0 million in Q4 2023, an increase from $85.2 million in Q4 2022 and $411.2 million in 2023, an increase from $239.5 million in 2022. Increases in both periods were primarily due to higher net cash generated from operating activities.\n-\nCash, cash equivalents and term deposits: $541.6 million as at December 31, 2023, up from $314.7 million as at December 31, 2022.\n-\nNet earnings (loss) attributable to shareholders from continuing operations: $91.8 million in Q4 2023, an increase from $41.9 million in Q4 2022, and $106.2 million in 2023, an increase from net loss of $49.2 million in 2022. Increases in both periods were primarily due to higher revenue, and lower mine standby costs, write-downs of assets, and income taxes.\n-\nAdjusted net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\")(2): $147.2 million in Q4 2023, an increase from $97.1 million in Q4 2022, and $463.3 million in 2023, an increase from $321.5 million in 2022. These increases were driven by higher net earnings, combined with the reversal of unrealized losses on derivative instruments of $24.6 million in Q4 2023 and $9.6 million in 2023, among other adjustments.\n-\nAdjusted net earnings(2): $49.3 million or $0.24 per share in Q4 2023, an increase from $25.8 million or $0.14 per share in Q4 2022, and $110.7 million or $0.57 per share in 2023, an increase from $10.1 million or $0.05 per share in 2022. Adjusted net earnings in Q4 2023 removes a $59.4 million gain on deferred income taxes due to the Turkiye hyperinflationary tax basis adjustment and added back a $24.6 million loss on derivative instruments, among other adjustments. Adjusted net earnings in 2023 removes a $59.4 million gain on deferred income taxes due to the Turkiye hyperinflationary tax basis adjustment and added back a one-time deferred tax expense adjustment of $22.6 million related to a retroactive income tax rate increase from 20% to 25% in Turkiye as well as a $29.3 million loss on foreign exchange translation of deferred tax balances, among other things.\n-\nFree cash flow(2): $29.3 million in Q4 2023, and negative $47.2 million in 2023 due to significant investment in growth capital. Free cash flow excluding capital expenditures at Skouries(2) was $82.0 million in Q4 2023 and $112.6 million in 2023.\n-\nProject Term Facility Drawdowns: Drawdowns on the Skouries Term Facility as of December 31, 2023 totaled \u20ac153.2 million.\n\u201cEldorado finished 2023 with its strongest quarter of production, delivering 143,166 ounces of gold,\u201d said George Burns, President and CEO of Eldorado Gold. \u201cAcross our four operating mines we produced 485,139 ounces of gold at an all-in sustaining cost of $1,220 per ounce, within our guidance range. This was an important year as we delivered 7% production growth, a 6% lower cash cost per ounce and a 4% lower AISC per ounce compared to 2022. We achieved this in a challenging inflationary environment and successfully delivered key initiatives across our operations. Kisladag successfully commissioned the new agglomeration drum and North Heap Leach Pad; Olympias started up its ventilation system and bulk emulsion explosives; Lamaque converted a portion of the Ormaque inferred resources into indicated in preparation for an initial reserve later in 2024. By completing these critical activities we have set up our operations for success to deliver consistent, sustainable results through continued execution.\u201d\n\u201cIn 2023, following the closing of the \u20ac680 million project financing facility with two Greek Banks we advanced into full construction on our transformational Skouries project in Greece. In addition, we completed a C$81.5 million strategic investment in Eldorado with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. As we advanced on finalizing key contracts in 2023, we remained within the original capital cost estimate from the December 2021 feasibility study. More recent and pending contracts incorporate labor rates and labor hours established through a diligent tendering process that are higher than the feasibility study. This has positioned us to provide an update to the overall capital cost estimate which has increased by 9% to $920 million from $845 million. With the project financing in place and a robust balance sheet we remain fully funded to complete the construction of Skouries. We look forward to bringing online this world class copper-gold asset that will deliver an additional 40% of high-quality gold production growth for our company by 2027.\u201d\n\u201cI would like to thank our global team for all their contributions during the year. We are well positioned for a strong 2024 and beyond as we continue to benefit from our efforts over the past several years to optimize our asset portfolio. With a solid balance sheet we are well funded to complete construction of Skouries and to advance on continuous improvement projects across our assets. Our focus in 2024 is on safety, productivity and driving efficiencies across our portfolio to generate free cash flow,\" concluded George Burns.\nSkouries Highlights\nCapital Estimate and Schedule\nAfter finalizing key contracts in 2023, the capital cost estimate remained in line with the December 2021 feasibility study estimate. More recent and pending contracts incorporate labor rates and labor hours established through a diligent tendering process that are higher than the feasibility study. This has resulted in a revised capital estimate of $920 million, an increase of 9% over the original estimate of $845 million.\nThe time invested in diligently negotiating the key project contracts has increased execution confidence with a modest effect on the production schedule. First production of the copper-gold concentrate is now expected in the third quarter of 2025 from prior guidance of mid-2025. As such, the 2025 gold production range has been lowered to between 50,000 to 60,000 ounces from prior guidance of 80,000 to 90,000 ounces. Copper production is expected to be between 15 to 20 million pounds in 2025. A steep ramp up curve is expected over that second half of 2025 and remains on track for commercial production at the end of 2025. We are assessing our plans with the goal of increasing our 2026 gold and copper production profile at Skouries.\nBetween the Skouries project finance facility and our balance sheet the project remains fully funded.\nCapital spend towards the original estimate of $845 million totalled $52.5 million in Q4 2023, and $153.8 million in 2023.\nAs at December 31, 2023:\n-\nOverall project progress was 38% complete and 70% complete when including the first phase of construction;\n-\nDetailed engineering was 61% complete and procurement was 82% complete;\n-\nProject execution and ramp-up continued for major earthworks including construction of haul roads to support construction of earthworks structures;\n-\nMobilized contractor and commenced work on the tailings filtration infrastructure earthworks and pilings;\n-\nProgress advanced on the foundation construction of the primary crusher; and\n-\nCompleted the upgrade of the underground power supply from 400V to 690V and the ventilation upgrade.\nAs the project advances in 2024 the capital spend is expected to be between $375 and $425 million.\nUpcoming milestones in 2024 include:\nProcurement and Engineering\n-\nSubstantial completion of procurement and engineering\nProcess Plant\n-\nCommence construction of the control room and electrical room building\n-\nCommence construction of the tailings thickeners\nTailings filter facility\n-\nAwarding the filter facility contract\n-\nPreassembly of the filter press plates and frames\n-\nCompletion of the structural steel\nIEWMF\n-\nCompletion of the coffer dam\nUnderground\n-\nAwarding the underground development and test stoping contract\n-\nCompletion of approximately 2,200 metres of underground development\nConstruction Progress\nWork continues to ramp up on construction for the build of major earth works structures including the haul roads, IEWMF construction, low-grade stockpile, water management, process facilities, crusher and filter buildings.

In Q2 2024 it is expected that the filter building contract will be awarded which will include the building structure, assembly of equipment within the building, including air compressors, conveyors, filter presses and other ancillary equipment, in addition to the piping and electrical work. The filter press plates arrived on site in Q1 2024 with the frames for supporting the filter press plates fabricated and expected to ship in Q2 2024. Preassembly is expected to start Q2 2024.\nWork for the mill/flotation building is in progress with commissioning work on overhead cranes, installation of construction lighting and scaffolding, and the commencement of structural steel work. Mechanical, piping and electrical work for the process plant are mobilizing with work commencing in Q1 2024.\nBy the end of 2024 we expect to have completed the IEWMF coffer dam and significantly advanced the IEWMF earthworks, water management facilities, process plant and filter plants.\nThe first four Company owned Cat 745 trucks have arrived on site with the remaining 15 scheduled for delivery through the end of Q2 2024. These trucks will be used once Skouries is in operation to build the lifts that will be required on the dry stack tailings facility. During construction of the civil works these trucks will be used as part of an integrated fleet with the earthwork's construction contractor for construction of the IEWMF facilities.\nUnderground Development\nThe upgrade of the underground power supply from 400V to 690V has been completed. The ventilation upgrade is also complete, and the new contact water pumping system will be fully operational in 2024.\nThe first phase of underground development continues to advance the West Decline and access to the test stopes with a local contractor. The second underground development contract proposals are in the final evaluation stage and awarding of the contract is planned for Q2 2024. This contract includes the test stope work as well as additional development and services work to support the development of the underground mine. We expect to complete approximately 2,200 metres of underground development by the end of 2024.\nEngineering\nAt December 31, 2023, engineering has been fully transitioned to Greece and was 61% complete with anticipated substantial completion in Q3 2024. Detailed engineering work continues to advance in all areas. The release of structural steel for fabrication is nearing completion and construction drawings are being issued to support the project schedule.\nProcurement\nAt December 31, 2023, procurement was at 82% with substantial completion expected in Q2 2024. All long lead items have been procured and focus is now shifting to managing fabrication and deliveries.\nOperational Readiness\nRecruitment of qualified and experienced people began in 2023 and will continue through 2024 as we build workforce capability as Skouries advances towards first production. Under the direction of Louw Smith, Eldorado\u2019s EVP, Development in Greece, we are progressing with establishing the Skouries operating team with approximately 40 personnel now on board. This includes 12 in leadership roles, 10 embedded in the construction projects teams of open pit mining, underground mining and dry stack tailings construction; and 9 in sustainability. Recruitment activities are on track with the operational workforce plan.\nWorkforce\nIn addition to the Operational Readiness team as of December 31, 2023, there were approximately 550 personnel on site which is expected to ramp up to 1,300 during 2024.\nYear in Review: Execution Focus and Delivery\n-\nHealth and Safety: The Company\u2019s lost-time injury frequency rate per million person-hours worked (\"LTIFR\") was 0.42 in Q4 2023, which was consistent with the LTIFR of Q4 2022 and overall was 0.65 in 2023, a 45% improvement from the LTIFR of 1.19 in 2022. We continue to take proactive steps to improve workplace safety and to ensure a safe working environment for our employees and contractors.\n-\nSkouries Project Financing Completed: In April 2023, Eldorado closed on a low-cost strategic \u20ac680.4 million project financing facility for the development of the Skouries project in Northern Greece.

See Note 6 of our consolidated financial statements.\n(2) These financial measures or ratios are non-IFRS financial measures or ratios. See the section 'Non-IFRS and Other Financial Measures and Ratios' for explanations and discussion of these non-IFRS financial measures or ratios.\n(3) By-product revenues are off-set against cash operating costs.\n(4) Attributable to shareholders of the Company.\n(5) Q1-Q3 2022 amounts have been adjusted to record additional depreciation expense upon review of the estimated remaining useful life of the existing heap leach pad and ADR plant at Kisladag (Q1 2022: $1.0 million, Q2 2022: $3.2 million, Q3 2022: $5.1 million, YTD 2022: $9.2 million).\n(6) A concentrate weight-scale calibration correction at Olympias has resulted in an adjustment to ending inventory as at March 31, 2023 of 1,024 gold ounces. Gold production in Q1 2023 has been reduced by this amount, resulting in additional production costs of $1.3 million and additional depreciation expense of $0.7 million for Q1 2023.\n(7) Q1-Q3 2023 revenues and production costs have been adjusted to reclassify freight-related concentrate sales pricing adjustments from selling expenses to revenues. The reclassification was $1.5 million for Q1 2023, $0.9 million for Q2 2023, and $0.4 million for Q3 2023, and has no impact on net income.\nGold sales in 2023 totaled 483,978 ounces, an increase of 7% from 452,953 ounces in 2022. The higher sales volume in 2023 compared with the prior year primarily reflected an increase of 20,243 ounces sold at Kisladag due to an increase of tonnes placed on the heap leach pad in 2023 and utilization of the newly commissioned NHLP. There was also an increase of 10,402 ounces sold at Olympias due to higher tonnes mined, tonnes processed and average gold grade, and an increase of 3,086 ounces sold at Lamaque due to increased tonnes mined and processed. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 2,706 ounces sold at Efemcukuru due largely to lower average gold grade. Gold sales were 144,827 ounces in Q4 2023, an increase of 9% from 132,462 ounces in Q4 2022, primarily due to increased production at Kisladag and Lamaque in the quarter.\nThe average realized gold price(3) was $1,944 per ounce sold in 2023, an increase from $1,787 per ounce sold in 2022, primarily driven by strong prices in Q3 and Q4 2023. The average realized gold price was $1,999 in Q4 2023 ($1,754 in Q4 2022).\nTotal revenue was $1,008.5 million in 2023, an increase of 16% from revenue of $872.0 million in 2022. The increase was due primarily to both higher sales volumes and average realized gold price. Total revenue was $306.9 million in Q4 2023, an increase of 25% from revenue of $246.2 million in Q4 2022, which increased for the same reasons.\nProduction costs of $478.9 million in 2023 increased from $459.6 million in 2022 and production costs of $137.6 million in Q4 2023 increased from $122.2 million in Q4 2022. Increases in both periods were the result of higher tonnes processed, resulting in increased labour costs and use of key consumables across most sites. This was partially offset by decreases in unit costs of key consumables such as electricity in Turkiye and Greece, and fuel in Turkiye and Canada, as global cost pressures eased during the year. Additionally, transport costs at Olympias were lower as a result of improved shipment logistics.\nProduction costs include royalty expense, which increased to $51.8 million in 2023 from $40.6 million in 2022, and to $16.5 million in Q4 2023 from $10.2 million in Q4 2022, primarily reflecting higher average gold prices combined with higher sales volumes. In Turkiye, royalties are paid on revenue less certain costs associated with ore haulage, mineral processing and related depreciation and are calculated on the basis of a sliding scale according to the average London Metal Exchange gold price during the calendar year. In Greece, royalties are paid on revenue and calculated on a sliding scale tied to international gold and base metal prices and the EUR:USD exchange rate.\nCash operating costs(3) averaged $743 per ounce sold in 2023, a decrease from $788 per ounce sold in 2022. In Q4 2023, cash operating costs averaged $716 per ounce sold, a decrease from $741 per ounce sold in Q4 2022. The decrease in both periods was primarily due to higher production and slightly lower unit costs for key consumables, including energy and fuel.\nAISC per ounce sold(3)decreased slightly to $1,220 in 2023 from $1,276 in 2022, and to $1,207 in Q4 2023 from $1,246 in Q4 2022. Decreases in both periods primarily reflect the decrease in cash operating costs per ounce sold, partially offset by higher royalties due to higher metal prices. The decrease in the year was also due to lower sustaining capital expenditures.\nWe reported net earnings attributable to shareholders from continuing operations of $106.2 million ($0.55 earnings per share) in 2023, compared to net loss of $49.2 million ($0.27 per share) in 2022 and net earnings of $91.8 million ($0.45 per share) in Q4 2023, compared to net earnings of $41.9 million ($0.23 earnings per share) in Q4 2022. Net earnings increased in 2023 primarily due to higher revenue, and lower mine standby costs, write-downs of assets, and income taxes. Net earnings in Q4 2023 reflected higher sales volumes and gold prices, and a higher income tax recovery, compared to Q4 2022.\nAdjusted net earnings from continuing operations(4) were $110.7 million ($0.57 per share) in 2023, compared to $10.1 million ($0.05 per share) in 2022. Adjusted net earnings in 2023 removes a $29.3 million loss on foreign exchange due to translation of deferred tax balances, $59.4 million gain on deferred income taxes due to the Turkiye hyperinflationary tax basis adjustment, $2.0 million gain on the non-cash revaluation of the derivative related to redemption options in our debt, $9.6 million unrealized loss on derivative instruments, and a $22.6 million deferred tax expense relating to the impact of tax rate changes in Turkiye. Adjusted net earnings were $49.3 million ($0.24 per share) in Q4 2023 after adjusting for a $3.7 million gain on foreign exchange due to translation of deferred tax balances, a $59.4 million gain on deferred income taxes due to the Turkiye hyperinflationary tax basis adjustment, a $4.0 million gain on the non-cash revaluation of the derivative related to redemption options in our debt, and a $24.6 million unrealized loss on derivative instruments.\nHigher sales volumes in 2023, combined with higher average realized prices, resulted in EBITDA(4) of $442.9 million, including $118.1 million in Q4 2023. Adjusted EBITDA(4) of $463.3 million in 2023 and $147.2 million in Q4 2023 exclude, among other things, share based payments and losses on derivative instruments.\nOperations Update\nGold Operations\n|\n| 3 months ended December 31, |\n| 12 months ended December 31, |\n| ||||||||\n|\n|\n| 2023 |\n|\n| 2022 |\n|\n| 2023 |\n|\n| 2022 |\n|\n| Total |\n|\n|\n|\n| ||||||||\n| Ounces produced |\n| 143,166 |\n|\n| 128,453 |\n|\n| 485,139 |\n|\n| 453,916 |\n|\n| Ounces sold |\n| 144,827 |\n|\n| 132,462 |\n|\n| 483,978 |\n|\n| 452,953 |\n|\n| Production costs | $137.6 |\n| $122.2 |\n| $478.9 |\n| $459.6 |\n| ||||\n| Cash operating costs ($/oz sold)(1) | $716 |\n| $741 |\n| $743 |\n| $788 |\n| ||||\n| All-in sustaining costs ($/oz sold)(1) | $1,207 |\n| $1,246 |\n| $1,220 |\n| $1,276 |\n| ||||\n| Sustaining capital expenditures(1) | $37.9 |\n| $36.9 |\n| $121.8 |\n| $126.5 |\n| ||||\n| Kisladag |\n|\n|\n|\n| ||||||||\n| Ounces produced |\n| 46,291 |\n| \u00a0...; | 40,307 |\n|\n| 154,849 |\n|\n| 135,801 |\n|\n| Ounces sold |\n| 46,051 |\n|\n| 39,833 |\n|\n| 154,456 |\n|\n| 134,213 |\n|\n| Production costs | $36.1 |\n| $32.2 |\n| $122.8 |\n| $120.1 |\n| ||||\n| Cash operating costs ($/oz sold)(1) | $623 |\n| $709 |\n| $657 |\n| $773 |\n| ||||\n| All-in sustaining costs ($/oz sold)(1) | $909 |\n| $884 |\n| $900 |\n| $1,000 |\n| ||||\n| Sustaining capital expenditures(1) | $5.6 |\n| $3.0 |\n| $16.0 |\n| $14.7 |\n| ||||\n| Lamaque |\n|\n|\n|\n| ||||||||\n| Ounces produced |\n| 56,619 |\n|\n| 51,349 |\n|\n| 177,069 |\n|\n| 174,097 |\n|\n| Ounces sold |\n| 57,040 |\n|\n| 51,244 |\n|\n| 176,495 |\n|\n| 173,409 |\n|\n| Production costs | $35.1 |\n| $29.2 |\n| $119.5 |\n| $116.7 |\n| ||||\n| Cash operating costs ($/oz sold)(1) | $580 |\n| $541 |\n| $643 |\n| $642 |\n| ||||\n| All-in sustaining costs ($/oz sold)(1) | $977 |\n| $925 |\n| $1,089 |\n| $1,036 |\n| ||||\n| Sustaining capital expenditures(1) | $20.7 |\n| $18.1 |\n| $72.7 |\n| $62.8 |\n| ||||\n| Efemcukuru |\n|\n|\n|\n| ||||||||\n| Ounces produced |\n| 22,374 |\n|\n| 21,362 |\n|\n| 86,088 |\n|\n| 87,685 |\n|\n| Ounces sold |\n| 22,497 |\n|\n| 21,486 |\n|\n| 86,078 |\n|\n| 88,784 |\n|\n| Production costs | $21.4 |\n| $17.9 |\n| $80.1 |\n| $73.1 |\n| ||||\n| Cash operating costs ($/oz sold)(1) | $816 |\n| $738 |\n| $797 |\n| $701 |\n| ||||\n| All-in sustaining costs ($/oz sold)(1) | $1,201 |\n| $1,138 |\n| $1,154 |\n| $1,091 |\n| ||||\n| Sustaining capital expenditures(1) | $4.4 |\n| $5.3 |\n| $14.0 |\n| $18.8 |\n| ||||\n| Olympias |\n|\n|\n|\n| ||||||||\n| Ounces produced |\n| 17,882 |\n|\n| 15,435 |\n|\n| 67,133 |\n|\n| 56,333 |\n|\n| Ounces sold |\n| 19,239 |\n|\n| 19,899 |\n|\n| 66,949 |\n|\n| 56,547 |\n|\n| Production costs | $44.9 |\n| $42.9 |\n| $156.5 |\n| $149.5 |\n| ||||\n| Cash operating costs ($/oz sold)(1) | $1,224 |\n| $1,325 |\n| $1,133 |\n| $1,409 |\n| ||||\n| All-in sustaining costs ($/oz sold)(1) | $1,872 |\n| $1,998 |\n| $1,688 |\n| $2,155 |\n| ||||\n| Sustaining capital expenditures(1) | $7.2 |\n| $10.5 |\n| $19.0 |\n| $30.3 |\n|\n(1) These are non-IFRS financial measures and ratios. Further details on these non-IFRS financial measures and ratios are provided in the MD&A accompanying Eldorado\u2019s financial statements filed from time to time on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.com.\nKisladag\nKisladag produced 154,849 ounces of gold in 2023, a 14% increase from 135,801 ounces in 2022. Gold production of 46,291 ounces in the quarter increased 15% from 40,307 ounces in Q4 2022, benefiting from the newly commissioned NHLP, along with ongoing optimization of on-belt ore agglomeration. Recoverable ounces placed on the combined heap leach pads (North and South) increased from the prior year as a result of the efficient stacking enabled by upgrades of the higher capacity overland conveyors and the commissioning of the NHLP area. Production also benefited from average grade increasing in 2023 to 0.78 grams per tonne, from an average grade of 0.74 grams per tonne in 2022.\nRevenue increased to $304.8 million in 2023 from $243.3 million in 2022 and increased to $92.9 million from $69.9 million in Q4 2022, reflecting a combination of higher gold sales and higher average realized prices in the current year and quarter.\nProduction costs increased to $122.8 million in 2023 from $120.1 million in 2022 primarily due to increased ore mined and processed and consumption of reagents, as well as higher royalties due to higher average gold prices, partially offset by decreases in unit costs of fuel and electricity as cost pressures in Europe eased in the year as compared to the prior year. Production costs during the quarter increased to $36.1 million from $32.2 million in Q4 2022 also as a result of higher gold production and ounces sold.\nDepreciation expense increased to $79.9 million in 2023 from $72.6 million in 2022 in line with higher tonnes mined and processed, and higher sales during the year. Depreciation in the quarter was in line with Q4 2022 despite higher sales in the current period due to less stacking on the South Leap leach pad, which depreciates at a faster rate given the shorter remaining useful life in terms of the number of ounces that can be stacked on the pad.\nCash operating costs per ounce sold in 2023 decreased to $657 from $773 in 2022 and decreased to $623 in Q4 2023 from $709 in Q4 2022. Decreases in both periods were primarily due to higher gold production and sales, as well as lower unit costs of consumables.\nAISC per ounce sold decreased to $900 in 2023 from $1,000 in 2022 primarily due to lower cash operating costs per ounce sold, partly offset by higher sustaining capital expenditure. In the quarter, AISC per ounce sold increased to $909 from $884 in Q4 2022 primarily due to higher sustaining capital expenditure, partially offset by lower cash operating costs per ounce sold.\nSustaining capital expenditure of $16.0 million in 2023, including $5.6 million in Q4 2023, primarily related to equipment rebuilds, and processing and infrastructure improvements. Growth capital investment of $83.7 million in 2023, including $27.8 million in Q4 2023, primarily included waste stripping to support the mine life extension, construction of the first phase of the NHLP and related infrastructure, and building relocation due to pit expansion.\nLamaque\nLamaque produced 177,069 ounces of gold in 2023, a 2% increase from 174,097 ounces in 2022 as a result of slightly higher ore throughput in the year and slightly higher grade. This was despite the mining disruption caused by forest fires earlier in the year that led to reduced mining faces available for ore production in Q3. Gold production of 56,619 ounces in the quarter was higher compared to 51,349 ounces in Q4 2022 and reflected strong throughput that was achieved due to productivity improvements at the mine, which allowed the mill to perform at capacity. Average grade of 7.36 grams per tonne in the quarter was slightly lower compared to Q4 2022, while average grade of 6.76 grams per tonne in 2023 slightly exceeded 6.65 grams per tonne in 2022.\nRevenue increased to $346.3 million in 2023 from $313.0 million in 2022 primarily reflecting a higher average realized gold price in the year. In the quarter, both a higher average realized gold price and higher sales were responsible for the increase in revenue to $114.9 million from $90.0 million in Q4 2022.\nProduction costs increased to $119.5 million in 2023 from $116.7 million in 2022, and $35.1 million in Q4 2023 from $29.2 million in Q4 2022, both primarily due to higher gold production and increased headcount to enable productivity, partially offset by slightly lower unit costs of key consumables, including fuel and cost savings from a weaker Canadian dollar as compared to the prior year. Cash operating costs per ounce sold was consistent between 2023 and 2022 but increased to $580 in Q4 2023 from $541 in Q4 2022 despite higher ounces sold primarily due to extra costs incurred in labour, contractors, and equipment rentals to increase productivity in the quarter.\nAISC per ounce sold increased to $1,089 in 2023 from $1,036 in 2022 and to $977 in Q4 2023 from $925 in Q4 2022 with increases in both periods reflecting higher cash operating costs per ounce sold and higher sustaining capital expenditure.\nSustaining capital expenditures of $72.7 million in 2023, including $20.7 million in Q4 2023, primarily related to underground development, equipment rebuilds, and expansion of the tailings management facility. Growth capital investments totalled $23.3 million in 2023, including $8.1 million in Q4 2023, and is primarily related to construction of underground infrastructure.\nEfemcukuru\nEfemcukuru produced 86,088 payable ounces of gold in 2023, a 2% decrease from 87,685 payable ounces in 2022, reflecting lower grades and recoveries in the year, partially offset by higher throughput. Gold production of 22,374 payable ounces in the quarter was 5% higher than 21,362 payable ounces produced in Q4 2022, primarily as a result of record throughput rates in the fourth quarter, averaging 1,500 tpd combined with higher grades.\nRevenue increased to $170.5 million in 2023 from $155.3 million in 2022 and to $46.7 million in Q4 2023 from $38.4 million in Q4 2022. Increases in both periods were driven primarily by higher average realized gold prices.\nProduction costs increased to $80.1 million in 2023 from $73.1 million in 2022 and increased to $21.4 million in Q4 2023 from $17.9 million in Q4 2022, primarily driven by rising costs of labour and increased royalties due to higher average realized gold prices. Operating cost increases and lower gold production in the year resulted in an increase in cash operating costs per ounce sold to $797 in 2023, from $701 in 2022. Cost increases despite higher gold produced in the quarter resulted in an increase in cash operating cost per ounce sold to $816 in Q4 2023 from $738 in Q4 2022. AISC per ounce sold increased to $1,154 in 2023 from $1,091 in 2022 and to $1,201 in Q4 2023 from $1,138 in Q4 2022, primarily reflecting higher cash operating costs per ounce sold.\nSustaining capital expenditure of $14.0 million in 2023, including $4.4 million in Q4 2023, related primarily to underground development and equipment rebuilds. Growth capital investment included both development drilling and resource conversion drilling at each of the Kokarpinar and Bati vein systems.\nOlympias\nOlympias produced 67,133 ounces of gold in 2023, a 19% increase from 56,333 ounces in 2022, reflecting higher average gold grade and higher throughput in the year. Throughput in 2023 was 15% higher than in 2022 due to higher mining rates, a result of key transformation initiatives implemented throughout the year, enabling stronger mining productivity and record mill throughput. Achievements in 2023 included a new electrical substation resulting in increased ventilation capacity, commissioning of bulk emulsion blasting, ongoing training and equipment optimization. Gold production of 17,882 ounces in Q4 2023 increased from 15,435 in Q4 2022 as a result of 13% higher throughput and higher gold grades in the quarter. Lead and silver production increased as well compared to Q4 2022, primarily reflecting higher throughput.\nRevenue increased to $186.8 million in 2023 from $159.9 million in 2022 and increased to $52.4 million in Q4 2023 from $47.9 million in Q4 2022 as a result of higher sales volumes and a higher average realized gold price. From October 1, 2021, revenue has been impacted by the 13% VAT import charge levied on customers importing Olympias gold concentrate into China. When levied, this import charge reduces revenue by a corresponding amount. Revenues in 2023 benefited from lower gold treatment and refining charges as we made more shipments to alternative markets where this 13% import VAT on gold concentrate was not imposed. Approximately 54% of shipments in 2023 were not subject to the 13% import VAT.\nProduction costs increased to $156.5 million in 2023 from $149.5 million in 2022 and to $44.9 million in Q4 2023 from $42.9 million in Q4 2022. Increases in both periods reflect higher production and volumes of concentrate sold, partially offset by decreases in unit costs of certain consumables, including electricity and fuel, and other cost savings as a result of recent transformation initiatives. Production costs also benefited from lower transport costs as a result of improved shipment logistics onsite.\nCash operating costs per ounce sold decreased to $1,133 in 2023 from $1,409 in 2022, primarily as a result of higher ounces sold, higher by-product credits, and less shipments to China incurring the 13% VAT import charge, which is included in cash operating costs. Similarly, cash operating costs per ounce sold decreased to $1,224 in Q4 2023 from $1,325 in Q4 2022 primarily due to higher ounces sold and by-product credits. AISC per ounce sold decreased to $1,688 in 2023 from $2,155 in 2022 and to $1,872 in Q4 2023 from $1,998 in Q4 2022 primarily due to the decrease in cash operating costs per ounce sold and lower sustaining capital.\nSustaining capital expenditure decreased to $19.0 million in 2023 from $30.3 million in 2022 and to $7.2 million in Q4 2023 from $10.5 million in Q4 2022. Spending in both periods primarily included underground development and underground infrastructure improvements. Growth capital investments in 2023 and 2022 primarily related to underground development.\nFor further information on the Company\u2019s operating results for the year-end and fourth quarter of 2023, please see the Company\u2019s Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis filed on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.com under the Company\u2019s profile.\nConference Call\nA conference call to discuss the details of the Company\u2019s Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2023 Results will be held by senior management on Friday, February 23, 2024 at 8:30 AM PT (11:30 AM ET).

Saylor maintains that Bitcoin is the ultimate store of value in a world grappling with rising inflation and economic uncertainty.\nIn his post Kiyosaki also praised President-elect Donald Trump and his position on Bitcoin. Kiyosaki highlighted his work with Trump and shared his belief that Trump could become the first \"Bitcoin President,\" a reflection of Trump's supportive attitude toward cryptocurrency.\nTrending: 1 in 4 Americans own a share of Bitcoin according to NASDAQ \u2014 this platform touts returns as high as 12.5% APY and is giving $100 in welcome rewards if you sign up today.\nHe wrote, \u201cLet's make America and the world richer again with Bitcoin.\u201d",

New business also decreased at the fastest pace this year.\n\"The manufacturing recovery moved into reverse in July, though the gloomier growth picture was accompanied by a marked cooling of inflation in the goods-producing sector,\" said Chris Williamson, the group's chief business economist. \"Business conditions worsened in July as the first fall in new orders since April caused a near-stalling of production.

Octa explains in the article what factors will influence the dynamics of the gold price and what will happen to the market this year.\nKUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA - Media OutReach Newswire - 29 February 2024 - Gold is trading above $2,000 per ounce in early 2024. Analysts expect that even later in the year, gold prices may remain above $2,000 per ounce, reaching new historical highs. Among the factors favouring this are geopolitical uncertainty, the likely weakening of the U.S. dollar, and potential interest rate cuts. But before relying on these factors in the future, we must understand how they have influenced the past.\nA new scenario of gold price dynamics\nFor the past 90 years, the value of gold has depended primarily on the volume of transactions between the Western and Eastern markets. Western countries determined supply and demand, while Eastern countries acted as counterparties to the transaction. Thus, when the volumes of physical gold purchased by Great Britain or Switzerland increased, its price grew, and vice versa. As a result, gold moved from the West to the East and back synchronously with the price decreasing or increasing.\nThe second factor that has historically influenced the price is the relationship between the price of gold and the real yield on U.S. government bonds. When the real yield decreased, bonds lost their appeal, and investors moved into gold. Once the trend reversed and real yields began to rise, investors returned to bonds.\nHowever, since the end of 2022, both patterns have failed. The U.S. ten-year bond yield rose to 4.33%, above the 2022 highs, beating a 15-year record. Despite expectations, this didn't lower the price of gold, which instead rose from November 2022 to August 2023 by 16%, from $1,643 to $1,954 per ounce.\nThe correlation between gold transaction volumes and the gold price also stopped working. Since the third quarter of 2022, the UK and Switzerland have been Netto-exporters of gold, i.e. sellers. According to the historical paradigm, this should also have been a reason for the price of gold to fall. However, as we can see, this is not happening. Thus, the West has not significantly influenced the pricing of precious metals.\nWhat affects gold in 2024?\nEscalating geopolitical conflicts are causing gold to rise in value. Due to the geopolitical events of 2022, dollar assets have become more risky for many countries. Central banks in the Global South, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East have been actively pursuing a policy of building up the gold part of foreign exchange reserves since the end of 2022. According to a World Gold Council (WGC) report, central banks bought 800 tonnes of gold in the first nine months of 2023, up 14% year-on-year. Excess demand from central banks has boosted the value of gold by 10 per cent in 2023.\n'It is the central banks' purchases of gold that will act as the main driver of growth in 2024', said Kar Yong Ang, the Octa financial market analyst. 'If the trend continues and the level of gold reserves moves towards an average of 40% of the gold composition in reserves, that would mean an additional $3.2 trillion in the asset\u2014a 25% rise in 2025, which would correspond to a price of $2,500 an ounce', he added.\nGold has also seen another rise since the beginning of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict: since October 2023, it has added more than 8%. Hence, we can conclude that any aggravation in geopolitics will have a positive impact on gold.\nThe stabilisation of inflation will continue to support gold quotes. In 2022, global inflation reached its highest levels in decades. However, it is also a fact that inflation passed its peak at the end of 2023. Most analysts believe inflationary pressures will continue to ease in 2024.\n'Traditionally, the gold price has been negatively correlated with the inflation rate. The lower the inflation rate, the lower the interest rates on government bonds. As a result, the relative attractiveness of non-interest-bearing assets such as gold increases', said Kar Yong Ang.\nDeveloping economies de-dollarisation. Investors see gold as an alternative means of building savings and protection against inflation and currency risk. Demand for gold is increasing because Brazil, Russia, India, and China (members of BRICKS) seek ways to improve their currency independence.\nThe main factors affecting gold's price are inflation, rising demand from central banks, de-dollarisation of developing economies, microeconomic situation, and geopolitics. The combination of these factors will create conditions for the growth of gold price in 2024\u2014in the first half of the year, the cost of the precious metal may exceed $2,200 per troy ounce. In the second half of the year, the upward trend in gold is likely to continue, and gold may show a price of $2,300 per ounce, so the average price in 2024 will be $2,170.\nHashtag: #Octa #gold\nThe issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.\nOcta\nOcta is an international broker that has been providing online trading services worldwide since 2011.

However, wealthy people see money differently and they're beginning to turn that conventional wisdom on its ear. A recent Wall Street Journal article revealed that many of today's millionaires prefer renting dream homes over buying. Benzinga looks at the factors that may be driving that trend.\nThe average American's purchase decisions regarding homeownership are largely driven by affordability. By contrast, the wealthy can choose from a nearly endless selection of communities worldwide offering a different brand of paradise. You\u2019d probably do it if you could afford to shuttle between Malibu and Monaco or the Hamptons and French Wine Country.\nRenting makes that kind of globe-trotting much easier. A rental contract can run from a few weeks to several years, whereas buying a home tends to tie the purchaser down. Even if you're wealthy, you'll have to pay millions in cash or commit to 30 years\u2019 worth of payments to finance a dream home. Renting gives you much greater flexibility to change your surroundings.\nThe lack of housing inventory nationwide affects wealthy neighborhoods too. Many of America's wealthiest communities are populated by long-standing residents and don't have many homes that come up for sale. When they do, the prestige of the neighborhood and the lack of comparably equipped luxury properties can drive the price beyond the point of reason.\nWealthy people don't get rich by overpaying for assets. If inventory is lacking and prices are high, it might make more financial sense for a wealthy person to rent until the market cools off. Home buying isn't the only way they can build wealth or hedge against inflation. They might be better off putting the money into dividend stocks or index funds for a few years.\nThat's especially true considering today's interest rates. It's one thing for prices to be elevated in neighborhoods like Bel Air and Tribeca, but when interest rates are hovering around the 6% range, financing $2,000,000 means $120k per year in interest payments. Add in loan principal and insurance and suddenly it might make sense for a wealthy person to rent and let the property owner pay the cost of ownership.\nHomeownership carries several hidden costs beyond the mortgage, property taxes and insurance. The features that make luxury homes luxurious, such as pools and lushly landscaped grounds, all cost money to maintain. Everything about a luxury home is more expensive. They're larger, which means they carry higher utility bills than regular homes. Repairs to the HVAC or plumbing systems of mansions can easily cost thousands of dollars.\nThese are not expenses that homeowners can write off. However, a landlord who rents their house out as a business can write all those expenses off against the rental income. If you're rich, why not let someone else bear those expenses? Renting gives you the full enjoyment of the house without the financial burden of maintenance.\nIncreased Diversification\nHomeownership has historically been the preferred path for Americans to wealth-building and prosperity. If you're already wealthy, that's no longer a consideration or motivating factor behind a home purchase. You may be able to grow your wealth more quickly by diverting the capital you would have spent on a home into a diversified investment portfolio of dividend stocks or REIT shares. These investments might generate income or grow wealth more quickly than homes appreciate.",

However, the speed and scale of the move caught many market watchers off guard, particularly in the absence of any significant change in the outlook for when the Federal Reserve would start cutting rates, which has been a key focus.\nTo be sure, the backdrop looks favorable for gold with geopolitical tensions more fraught than ever. And gold\u2019s performance over the past year has surprised some veteran market watchers well before the current surge, as prices remained at elevated levels despite spiking real interest rates.\nGold typically has an inverse relationship with bond yields, but has been supported by strong central bank buying and demand from consumers in China in particular.\nSo is gold\u2019s rally a flash in the pan, or is the precious metal just getting started? Here are five key charts to watch:\nReal Yields\nThe biggest driver of the gold price over the past year has been the market\u2019s anticipation of when the Fed will start lowering borrowing costs. Swaps markets show a 65% chance of a cut in June, compared with 58% at the end of February.\nOn Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated to lawmakers that the US central bank is in no rush to cut interest rates until policymakers are convinced they have won their battle over inflation.\nRead More: Powell Reiterates Fed Needs More Confidence on Inflation to Cut\nWhen the Fed eventually pivots, it will lower the opportunity costs of holding gold, which doesn\u2019t bear interest. US real yields have been tracking down since last October, but gold\u2019s recent jump has far outpaced what might have been expected.\nTechnical Indicators\nGold hit a fresh record of $2,152.25 an ounce on Wednesday. It was trading little changed Thursday at $2,146.10 as of 10:13 a.m. Singapore time.\nUnited Overseas Bank Ltd. sees the next significant resistance price at $2,163, but for Rhona O\u2019Connell, head of market analysis at StoneX Financial Ltd., gold is already overbought above $2,115. The weak US numbers at the end of last week triggered technical and momentum trades, plus a \u201cbandwagon effect,\u201d she said.\nGold Futures Open Interest\nThe latest Comex data shows money managers added fresh long positions, fueling gains in gold. That rise in open interest implies investors are getting more bullish about gold, rather than just closing out existing short positions.\nChinese Buying\nSwiss exports to China \u2014 usually a good proxy of Chinese demand for gold \u2014 nearly tripled in January, as consumers sought a hedge against turmoil in the country\u2019s stock market and property sector. With the nation\u2019s biggest state-owned lenders slashing deposit rates, putting money in the bank has become relatively less attractive compared with bullion.\nIn addition, China is among the central banks buying gold to reduce its dependence on the dollar. China has been among the biggest stockpilers of gold in the past year as nations from Poland to Singapore diversify their financial reserves by adding the precious metal.\nETF Disconnect\nIn contrast to persistent central bank demand for the precious metal, gold-backed exchange-traded funds have cut their holdings for seven consecutive months.\nThose ETF holdings are likely to stabilize, according to James Steel, an analyst at HSBC Holdings Plc. That could add further momentum to bullion.\n(Adds latest price in ninth paragraph.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never Built\nThe Battle to Unseat the Aeron, the World\u2019s Most Coveted Office Chair\nHumanoid Robots at Amazon Provide Glimpse of an Automated Workplace\nImmigration Rage Drowns Out the US Labor Market\u2019s Need for Workers\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

Is there any specific aspect you can attribute this to? A: Since January 2023, our Chilean operations have recovered by focusing on large copper producers, which are the main producers in Chile. We have put 100% of our effort into serving these major clients, resulting in very good margins and the renewal of key contracts for the next five years. (Daniel Maheu, CFO)\nQ: Can you talk about your current total liquidity position and what your plans are in terms of loan repayment for fiscal '25? A: In fiscal 2024, we focused on profitability and used it to reduce our debt by more than $4 million. We will continue to focus on increasing margins and reducing debt while investing in new drill rigs for our contracts in Chile. Our liquidity is growing steadily. (Daniel Maheu, CFO)\nQ: Should we expect the adjusted gross margin to stabilize at this level going forward? Does management have any target for the adjusted gross margin? A: Our margins should remain stable due to our strategic decisions, such as exiting the West African market and focusing on profitable operations in Chile and Canada. The only potential for significant margin increase would be a resurgence in junior mining activity in Canada, which we hope to see in 2024. (Daniel Maheu, CFO)\nQ: What were the main factors contributing to the improved profitability in Q4? A: The improved profitability in Q4 was due to increased drilling activity in Chile, cessation of unprofitable operations in West Africa, and the absence of last year's one-time restructuring charges. (Pierre Alexandre, CEO)\nQ: How has the exit from West Africa impacted your financial performance? A: Exiting West Africa has allowed us to focus on more stable and profitable markets like Canada and Chile. This strategic shift has significantly improved our margins and overall financial performance. (Pierre Alexandre, CEO)\nQ: Can you provide more details on the new contracts secured in Chile? A: We have secured two large renewable and copper drilling projects in Chile with senior mining companies. One contract is for three years with an option to extend for two years, and the other, our largest by revenue, is for five years. (Pierre Alexandre, CEO)\nQ: What are your expectations for customer demand given the current metal prices? A: With record high gold prices and strong copper pricing, we expect continued strong demand from senior and well-financed intermediate mining companies. If junior companies regain access to capital, demand could increase significantly. (Pierre Alexandre, CEO)\nQ: How has the financial performance of your international operations evolved? A: Our international operations have shown improved profitability, primarily due to increased drilling activity in Chile and the cessation of operations in West Africa. This has led to a significant increase in our adjusted gross margin. (Daniel Maheu, CFO)\nQ: What are the key elements of your strategic plan to improve operating performance? A: Our strategic plan includes focusing on Canadian gold drilling operations, prioritizing long-term contracts with major and intermediate customers, pursuing high-margin international contracts, investing in drilling technologies, and fostering a team-oriented leadership structure. (Pierre Alexandre, CEO)\nQ: How has the reduction in drilling activity in Canada affected your overall revenue? A: The reduction in drilling activity in Canada, particularly due to financing difficulties for junior mining companies, has impacted our revenue. However, this was partially offset by increased activity in Chile and the strategic exit from West Africa. (Daniel Maheu, CFO)",

Read on to learn more.\nSponsored: Owe the IRS $10K or more? Schedule a FREE consultation to see if you qualify for tax relief.\nPrecious Metals Are a Tangible Asset\nOne of the strongest arguments for owning gold, silver or other precious metals is that they are a tangible asset. While you can buy or sell stocks all day on the open market, those transactions are electronic in nature. Unless you buy a stock directly from a company and pay the transfer agent a fee, you\u2019ll never actually hold a stock certificate in your hand. And even if you do, it\u2019s just a piece of paper that has no intrinsic value.\nGold and silver, on the other hand, have weight and beauty and physical heft. Proponents argue that they are a \u201creal\u201d form of money, as opposed to financial assets like stocks or even the U.S. dollar. Even if the economy tanks \u2014 or especially if it does \u2014 your physical precious metals may have more purchasing power than other assets. As financial services firm UBS tells it, \u201cAs they exist physically, they have an intrinsic or material value.\u201d\nRelated: I\u2019m a Financial Advisor: These 5 Index Funds Are All You Really Need\nGold and Silver Are 2 Distinct Investments\nPrecious metals investors often own both gold and silver. However, they don\u2019t always trade in lockstep, even though they are both precious metals.\nSilver, for example, is more volatile in price and more tied to the global economy. This makes sense, because according to the World Silver Survey, 50% of all silver is used in high technology and heavy industry. This includes everyday products ranging from smartphones and tablets to automobiles and solar-panel cells.\nWhile gold has its industrial uses, they are more limited than with silver. But this actually makes the gold less correlated to the stock market, as it is less sensitive to the economy. This in turn can make gold a good investment if you\u2019re looking to protect your portfolio from an economic downturn, according to Morgan Stanley.",

But China seems to be going the other way, with both individuals and the government itself purchasing the precious metal.\nChinese central banks have continued their gold-buying spree, helping gold prices surge past the key $2,000 per ounce mark. Total withdrawals from the Shanghai Gold Exchange rose 7% year-over-year in 2023 to 1,687 tonnes of gold. And Chinese gold ETFs saw sizable inflows as investors sought safety in the commodity.\n\"Gold's attractiveness was further boosted by the increasing need of households to preserve value: the local gold price's outstanding performance drew their attention when the currency and other Chinese assets weakened,\" a separate January WGC report found.\nThe rush toward the safe haven asset marks the uncertainty around China's financial health. China's market mayhem has dragged the benchmark CSI 300 stock index down 5% this month alone and 23% over the past year. In the struggling real estate sector, the Evergrande debt saga continues, with Beijing trying to stem the fallout with a \"cure kit.\"\nThe Chinese economy has also been sluggish post-COVID, with the country now struggling to stave off deflation, plug the foreign investment hemorrhage, and arrest a stock market slump.\nBy the end of 2023, foreign investors had sucked 90% of the money they invested in Chinese stocks right back out. Even Chinese investors are so sick of the rout they've poured money into Japanese stocks.\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

He has explained in the past it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t \u201ctrust\u201d the Federal Reserve, which controls the supply of money. And he's known to speak out on his thoughts on their policies.\nIn October, he predicted, \u201cGold will soon break through $2,100 and then take off. You will wish you had bought gold below $2,000. Next stop gold $3,700.\u201d\nKiyosaki likes silver, too. \u201cSilver from $23 to $68 an ounce,\u201d he said, projecting major upside for the gray metal.\nTo be sure, despite their \u201csafe haven\u201d status, the price of precious metals can still be volatile.

Friday and Monday\u2019s market action brought the largest two day-decline in the S&P 500, 2.6%, in more than year.\nTruist Co-CIO Keith Lerner pointed out in a note to clients on Monday night that the pullback seen recently in the market is to be expected in any given year.\n\u201cPeriodic pullbacks are the admission price to the market,\u201d Lerner wrote.\nThe S&P 500's 4% intra-year fall in 2024 is still a far cry from the average 14% drawdown seen over the last forty years, per Lerner's analysis. And given this, the market's current direction could get worse before it gets better.\n\u201cOur view remains that the primary stock market trend remains positive,\u201d Lerner wrote. \u201cWe continue to expect a bumpier path forward relative to the abnormally-smooth first quarter ride.\u201d\n- Dani Romero\n'Interest rate volatility' could hit homebuilder forecasts this earnings season: UBS\nUncertainty over when the Fed will raise interest rates could hit homebuilders' outlooks in the upcoming earnings season, according to UBS analysts.\n\u201cWe expect solid 1Q homebuilder financial results, with upbeat industry demand commentary from management teams, consistent with Lennar (LEN) and KB Home (KBH),\u201d John Lovallo, UBS analyst, wrote in a note to clients Tuesday morning. But he noted that \"interest rate volatility/uncertainty remains heightened, exacerbated by last week's CPI, which could result in conservative homebuilder gross margin outlooks.\"\nBuilders have been offering incentives like mortgage rate buydowns to sell homes in the high interest rate environment. Such deal sweeteners while effective hurt profit margins.\nThe 30-year fixed mortgage rate has been hovering around 7% in recent weeks, a far cry from the below-5% rates that many homeowners are locked into already. That has kept more buyers and sellers on the sidelines.\nThe prospect of the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate cut looks murkier following recent higher than expected inflation prints, a factor likely to pressure builder stocks near term.\nAs a result, UBS has been \u201c more cautious than consensus on '24/'25 homebuilding gross margins, although Street forecasts seem to have moderated to some extent,\u201d Lovallo noted.\nDR Horton (DHI), the largest builder by market cap, is expected to report earnings before the market opens on Thursday.\n- Allie Canal\nPowell: Will take 'longer than expected' to reach confidence on inflation\nFederal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday it will likely take \"longer than expected\" for the central bank to be confident in its inflation fight, citing a \"lack of further progress\" this year when it comes to bringing inflation back down to the Fed's 2% target.\nPowell, who noted the US economy over the past year has been \"quite strong,\" pointed to hotter-than-expected inflation data over the past three months.\n\u201cThe recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence and instead indicate that it\u2019s likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence,\" he said during a fireside chat with Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem in DC.\nThe central bank leader suggested a higher-for-longer policy stance is here to stay, adding, \"We can maintain the current level of restriction for as long as needed.\"\nYields jumped on the heels of his comments with the 2-year note briefly touching above 5% \u2014 its highest level since November. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX), which touched 2024 highs on Monday, climbed about 6 basis points to trade around 4.69%.\nIn equities, the benchmark S&P 500 reversed earlier gains while the Dow held positive.\n- Allie Canal\nIt's time to start paying attention to the Vix\nHigher for longer interest rate angst, coupled with greater geopolitical risks, are beginning to show up in markets.\nThe Cboe Volatility Index (^VIX), otherwise known as Wall Street's \"fear gauge,\" closed above 19 for the first time since Halloween on Monday. The index continued to hover at those levels on Tuesday.\nCiti's equity strategist Stuart Kaiser said the moves point to \"localized signs of stress\" in the market as rising yields continue to pressure stocks while investors also digest escalating tensions in the Middle East.\nFundstrat head of research Tom Lee said the surging Vix means investors don't believe the worst is priced into stocks and to be extra cautious when buying any dip.\n\"Investors are de-risking,\" he said in a video to subscribers uploaded early Tuesday. \"We're in the danger part but it does increase opportunity. Ultimately, the Vix says to move slow here. Maybe extra slowly.\"\n- Brian Sozzi\nThe gold calls continue on the Street\nCiti is out today with a $3,000 an ounce gold call, which could very well fuel more sales of gold bars at Costco (COST)!\nDeutsche Bank is being slightly more measured today, forecasting $2,400 an ounce for gold by year end and $2,600 an ounce by December 2025. Gold prices currently stand around $2,400 an ounce.\nA couple things from their note that caught my attention:\nOn potential buying if gold prices pullback: \"We think gold is likely to remain on a strong footing as any profit-taking by early investors would be replaced by investment from those who have so far not participated in the move, but agree philosophically with its direction.\"\nOn the Fed's influence on gold: \"From an inflation and monetary policy standpoint, gold's strength stems from the ability to 'have it both ways' whereby inflation remains a significant concern, but at the same time, the FOMC judges rates as sufficiently restrictive and, hence, the next move (however much delayed) remains a cut.\"\n- Allie Canal\nDow edges higher\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged higher in afternoon trading on Tuesday, up about 0.5%, as the index looked to snap a six-day losing streak.\nBoth the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) reversed earlier losses to trade mostly flat.\nMeanwhile, bond yields remain at multi-month highs, with the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) climbing about 4 basis points to trade around 4.66%.\n- Allie Canal\nTrump Media stock tanks... again\nTrump Media & Technology Group (DJT), the parent company of Donald Trump's social media platform Truth Social, fell about 12% on Tuesday after the company announced it's launching a new live TV streaming platform.\nAccording to a press release, Trump Media will launch the live streaming service on phones, tablets, and TV through the Truth Social app.\n\"The streaming content is expected to focus on live TV including news networks, religious channels, family-friendly content including films and documentaries; and other content that has been cancelled, is at risk of cancellation, or is being suppressed on other platforms and services,\" according to the release.\nTrump Media went public on the Nasdaq after merging with special purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition Corp. in a deal approved by shareholders late last month. Shares are down more than 60% since the end of March.\nOn Monday, the stock tumbled on news the company had filed to issue more than 21 million shares.\nTrump maintains a roughly 60% stake in Truth Social. At current trading levels of about $23.40 a share, Trump Media boasts a market cap of roughly $3.2 billion, giving the former president a stake worth around $1.9 billion. Right after the company's public debut, Trump's stake was worth just over $4.5 billion.\n- Allie Canal\nStocks extend declines, reverse earlier gains\nStocks extended declines in mid-morning trading on Tuesday after markets initially eyed a broader comeback earlier in the session.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hugged the flatline after coming off a six-session run of losses. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped about 0.3% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell roughly 0.2%.\nThe moves come as bond yields remain at multi-month highs, coupled with rising tensions in the Middle East following Iran's weekend attacks on Israel.\n- Dani Romero\nNew data shows market for new homes 'starting to show cracks'\nNew residential construction, including single-family and multifamily homes, tumbled by the largest amount in four years as rising mortgage rates weaken housing activity.\nHousing starts fell 14.7% month over month in March, dropping from a 1.55 million units annualized pace to 1.32 million units annualized, according to data from the Census Bureau released Tuesday. Single-family starts fell 12.4% month over month.\nAccording to LPL Financial\u2019s chief economist, Jeffrey Roach, the data indicates how new home construction is \"starting to show cracks in the pace of growth.\"\n\u201cHousing construction is poised to slow as potential homebuyers indicate now is a poor time to buy a home. Investors should expect residential investment becoming a drag on GDP growth in the coming quarters. Housing activity may not fully stabilize until the Fed commences their easing cycle.\"\nThe fresh government data comes after builder sentiment in April was flat from the previous month, breaking four consecutive months of gains. The NAHB said, \u201cBuyers are hesitating until they can better gauge where interest rates are headed.\u201d\n\u201cLooking ahead, we still think single-family starts stand to benefit from the lack of second-hand homes on the market, shifting demand to newbuilds,\" Thomas Ryan, property economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients following the release.\n\"But that strength will be offset by weakness in multi-family starts, which we expect will remain around current levels, leaving total housing starts little higher than they currently are by the end of this year.\"\nThe SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) was trading lower by more than 1% Tuesday morning.\n- Allie Canal\nLive Nation falls on antitrust probe report\nShares of Live Nation (LYV), the parent company of Ticketmaster, fell about 7% early Tuesday after the Wall Street Journal reported the Department of Justice (DOJ) is preparing to file an antitrust lawsuit against the company as soon as next month.\nAccording to the report, the DOJ will allege that Live Nation has leveraged its dominance in the marketplace to harm competitors. The specific claims the department could allege are unknown at this time.\nThe federal government approved the Live Nation-Ticketmaster merger in 2010. Since then, the company has been at the center of antitrust concerns, with critics taking aim at its sky-high ticket fees and accusing the entertainment giant of monopolistic practices and anti-competitive behavior.\nIn 2020, the department updated the company's consent decree, an agreement that barred Live Nation from strong-arming venues into using TicketMaster for its tours, and extended it until 2025 after finding evidence the company repeatedly and over the course of several years engaged in conduct that violated its earlier agreement.\nIn the face of Tuesday's stock declines, shares are down about 1% since the start of the year.\n- Allie Canal\nStocks eye comeback\nThe Dow rose about 200 points on Tuesday as markets eyed a broader comeback to snap a six-day losing streak.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) climbed around 0.6% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) hugged the flatline. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped roughly 0.1%.\nBond yields continued to rise after the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) touched 2024 highs on Monday. The yield was up about 4 basis points to trade at around 4.66% early Tuesday.\n- Brian Sozzi\nChatting interest rates and markets with BNY Mellon\u2019s CEO\nI just had a good post-earnings chat with BNY Mellon (BK) CEO Robin Vince. BNY Mellon reported its quarterly results this morning, and the stock is up 2% premarket.\nI appreciated his thoughts on rates and markets (below), and I took them as inflationary!\n\u201cAs I think about the path of interest rates, there are a few things that are going on in the world. Clearly, we've got geopolitical risks that are out there, and just today, the potential escalation of the ongoing [Israel/Iran] conflict \u2014 that's certainly a risk. We've got consistently, relatively high inflation in the US and that's clearly a bit of a risk. So that brings into some question the path of interest rates. We've got fiscal challenges in the US and the continued [high] amount of issuance of US Treasurys from a volumes point of view. That can be quite good for our business, but as a citizen and a taxpayer, you have to worry a little bit about the path of debt sustainability in the United States. So there's a lot going on.\n\u201cNow, I'll give you the flip side as well because what we see is really strong, underlying underpinnings for the US economy, and it's not to say that we won't have a correction at some point in the stock market \u2014 that could well happen. It's not to say we couldn't have a recession at some point. That's kind of inevitable at some point in time. But when you look at the advantages that the US has right now, it's got a lot of significant advantages on a relative basis in the world. It's a great destination for investment. You can hear that from CEOs internationally. You can see it from investors putting their money into the United States, you can see the performance of the stock market, and there are a lot of tailwinds that are coming into the markets right now. So I would say it's a place you have to be prepared for all eventualities. Could we see the Fed stay on hold, maybe. Could we see the Fed cut rates this year? Probably. Could we see the Fed hike rates? Not impossible. You got to be prepared, but at the same time, the underlying direction of travel for the US is pretty positive.\u201d\n- Brian Sozzi\nBring on those Starbucks earnings\nStarbucks (SBUX) earnings will be out in a few weeks, and I have consumed note upon note suggesting the report could be ugly.\nMost of the concern on Starbucks at the moment stems from falling store traffic in the US, in part because prices for what Starbucks sells have gone through the roof. I paid $7 for a venti cold brew at a NYC store a week ago! (I have been cutting back trips to Starbucks.)\nBernstein is out this morning with a fresh look at store traffic, and it isn't pretty.\nStarbucks shares year to date: -11.3%.\n- Brian Sozzi\nMarkets quote of the morning....\nStock futures have been all over the map this morning after Monday's hot retail sales report drove a drubbing.\nThe indecision on the part of investors comes as they are still clinging to hopes of a June interest rate cut, which seems unlikely given how the macro data has trended in April.\nI think JPMorgan's strategy team offers up a good blunt take on markets this morning as if to level-set investors:\n\"For a market reliant on immaculate disinflation, a dovish Fed reaction function, and diminishing tail risks on growth, the continuation of hot growth and inflation data can bring us to a tipping point where a tighter stock vee bond risk premium finally produces a market correction. Inflation risks are also compounded by upside risks to oil due to geopolitical developments related to Russia and risk of further escalation in the Middle East. Additionally, investor positioning is elevated, with cash allocations at historical lows.\"",

It is an early warning of the potential catastrophe she is about to inflict on the global economy.\nThe artificial intelligence stocks might grab the headlines, along with tech companies and commodities. But there has been only one real standout asset in 2024 so far and that\u2019s gold.\nFrom $2,000 an ounce at the start of the year, it reached $2,500 last week, and may keep on climbing higher. It is now well above the highs it reached at the height of the eurozone crisis, and shows little sign of slowing down.\nTo the mainstream analysts who follow the precious metal, there are a host of reasons for that. The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates in the autumn, and that always boosts the gold price as the metal does not pay any interest. There is plenty of geopolitical uncertainty around, with conflicts in the Middle East, and the war between Russia and Ukraine escalating.\nAnd of course, central banks have increased their holdings. \u201cLed by China, central banks purchased 1,037 tonnes of gold in 2023,\u201d claimed a recent note from JP Morgan on the soaring price.\n\u201cIn the same vein, 2024 has started strongly with net purchases of 290 tonnes in the first quarter \u2013 making it the fourth strongest quarter of purchases since the buying binge began in 2022, according to the World Gold Council.\u201d\nAdd those all up, and the stage was always set for a stronger gold price. And yet, there may be a far bigger force at work: the prospect of a Kamala Harris presidency. Over the last month, the American vice-president has executed a political coup of breathtaking audacity.\nShe filled the void left by the ageing Joe Biden with speed, killed off any potential rivals and wrapped up the nomination with hardly a murmur of opposition. There is no question that she is a formidable political street-fighter. In response, her Republican rival Donald Trump has been left floundering, and looks old and exhausted. Harris is ahead in the polls, and is the favourite with the bookmakers.",

This is on the back of growing demand from emerging markets like India and China, who were responsible for 75% of this demand. This ever-increasing trajectory of demand is expected to continue in the current year as well which is going to be discussed below.\nAmidst the inflationary state in the U.S. for the past while, and the resulting uncertainty in the market, gold has seen its prices rise in 2023, reaching its all-time high, on the back of 13% increase. The increase in demand mainly came from central banks, the industrial sector, and investors. A trend was also observed in 2023, wherein the global sovereign wealth funds were reported to be increasing their holdings in the precious metal.\nThe price of gold is a complex mechanism, as it is impacted by several factors like demand, market stability, and interest rates, to name a few. Nevertheless, several analysts are looking to a positive future for gold, as they expect the prices to be sitting somewhere between $2,421.00 and $2,651.00 (per ounce rate) by the current year end, as compared to its current price of $2374.31, as of writing this article.\nThis trend is also shaping up on the back of the Fed\u2019s plans for a rate cut later in the year, as the gold prices usually have an inverse relationship with the market interest rate. As such, the rate cut that is expected to occur somewhere in September is also helping analysts forecast the precious metal\u2019s price increase in 2024.\nFollowing is what was spoken about the gold market by an analyst at PrimeXBT, Kathryn Davies, in June 2024:\n\u201cGold has fallen from its all-time high of $2,222 after the SNB cut rates, boosting the USD. However, the gold price remains supported by the prospect of Federal Reserve rate cuts and a lower interest rate environment globally. Elevated geopolitical tensions and central bank purchases also keep demand high, and the price supported. As a result, Gold could see more all-time highs as we progress through 2024, rising to $2400 by the year\u2019s end.\u201d\nIn terms of the global market, China is a crucial player in the gold market \u2013 China is not only the largest producer of gold (producing 12% of gold in 2023), but also the largest consumer of gold, with its central bank, on its own, buying 225 tons of gold in 2023, up from 62 tons in the previous year. Analysts have attributed China's massive buying of gold to the freezing of Russian assets by the U.S. and its allies, which China is attempting to hedge itself from by buying Gold - pushing up the gold prices by doing so.\nAustralia and Russia closely follow China in the gold production game; in 2023, China, Russia, and Australia recorded a gold production volume of 375 tons, 325 tons, and 314 tons, respectively. The U.S. was placed 5th on the same list created by Insider Monkey, with a production volume of 173 tons! To date, 209,000 tons of gold have been mined across the globe, equaling a value of massive $12 trillion!\nHaving discussed the expected future of gold prices, it\u2019s time we explore the world of gold stocks, which directly correlate with the gold price trajectory. Thus, let\u2019s now jump to our list of 10 Best Gold Stocks to Buy According to Reddit and Robinhood.\nMethodology\nExtensive research across the Reddit discussion forums, along with the Robinhood Index, helped us in curating our preliminary list of all the stocks discussed across the two sources. Based on the analysts' sentiment regarding each stock across both sources, we assigned the Reddit score and Robinhood score to the stocks and ranked them based on the average score, which we will refer to as the Overall score. Lower the score, better the ranking of stock. For stocks with an equal Overall score, we used Reddit score as the tiebreaker.\nThe overall score was derived from the number of upticks on Reddit forums against the respective stocks, and the number of analysts assigning buy ratings to the respective stocks on Robinhood. We also peeked into Insider Monkey\u2019s database that tracks the activity of 920 hedge funds, wherein we collected information about the hedge fund investors\u2019 holders of all these stocks to reaffirm the respective stocks' sentiment across the two sources.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nAerial view of a gold mine with equipment mining the earth for resources.\nWith 90% of analysts at Robinhood giving a buy rating to the stock, Alamos Gold Inc. (NYSE: AGI), a Canadian gold mining company, is on our list of Best Gold Stocks to Buy According to Reddit and Robinhood.\nIn April, we noticed that some analysts at Bank of America upgraded the rating of the stock from hold to buy. Alamos Gold Inc. is engaged in three operating mines in North America, including Young-Davidson mine and Island Gold mine in Canada, and Mulatos mine in Mexico. It has four other projects well under development as of now.\nOn top of that, in March 2024, Alamos Gold Inc. (NYSE:AGI) acquired the Magino mine in Ontario, Canada, which would boost the miner\u2019s production to 600,000 ounces per year in the shorter run, while producing up to 900,000 ounces per year in the longer run. Furthermore, their acquisition of Magino mine also included Argonaut, both of which would result in pretax synergies of $515 million.\nThe company also performed quite impressively in Q1 2024, in which they bagged a record quarterly revenue of $280 million (10% increase from 1st quarter of 2023), also generating $24 million worth of free cash flow!\nThis was on the back of gold production which took an upturn in the quarter, increasing 6% from the first quarter of 2023 to 135,700 ounces of gold production. The production from the Mulatos mine and the resulting staggering output of 62,200 ounces of gold (up by 23.2% from Q1 2023) primarily drove this overall revenue growth in the quarter. Higher demand of gold and increased gold prices further bolstered the company's performance in the quarter.\nHaving said that, with its total quarterly cash costs and all-in sustaining costs above the company's annual guidance (expected to come down in the following three quarters) - with an upside potential of 15.3%, and with hedge fund holdings worth $426.8 million, it\u2019s quite understandable why the stock makes it to our list of Best Gold Stocks to Buy.\nOverall AGI ranks 10th on our list of the best gold stocks to buy according to Reddit and Robinhood. You can visit 10 Best Gold Stocks to Buy According to Reddit and Robinhoodto see the other gold stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AGI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AGI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.",

But Treasury yields also spurted upward following the latest report on the U.S. economy to blow past expectations.\nThe economy and financial markets are in an awkward phase where such strength raises hopes for growing profits at companies but also hurts prospects for easier interest rates from the Federal Reserve.\nTraders want lower interest rates, which can give the overall economy a boost, and much of the U.S. stock market's run to records recently was built on expectations for cuts.\nBut strong reports like Monday's, which showed U.S. shoppers increased their spending at retailers last month by more than expected, have traders broadly forecasting just one or two cuts to rates this year, according to data from CME Group. That's down from expectations for six or more cuts at the start of this year. Some traders are bracing for potentially no cuts because inflation and the overall economy have remained stubbornly above forecasts this year.\nHigh interest rates and bond yields hurt prices for all kinds of investments, particularly those that look expensive or those that compete for the same kinds of investors as bonds do.\nMore influential was weakness for Big Tech stocks. Apple dropped 2.2%, Nvidia fell 2.5% and Microsoft sank 2%. They've been past beneficiaries of low interest rates and often feel pressure when yields are rising.

London\u2019s FTSE 100 fell 0.4%.\nHong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index closed down 0.7%. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 closed 0.7% lower, but China\u2019s Shanghai Composite Index finished 1.3% higher.\nGold futures rose to settle at roughly $2,383 a troy ounce on Monday. They are up 16% this year.\nThe Paris-based International Energy Agency, which monitors oil markets on behalf of developed economies, said Monday that Iran\u2019s weekend air attacks on Israeli military facilities had raised the risk of increased volatility in oil markets and provided a fresh reminder of the importance of oil security.\nAnalysts at ANZ said in a research report that the attack would raise concerns about possible disruption to global oil supply.\n\u201cThe extent of that risk will likely be determined by the reaction of Israel\u2019s government,\u201d the analysts added.\nIsrael\u2019s war cabinet met for several hours Monday to discuss its response, an Israeli official told CNN.\nThe Middle East was plunged into uncharted waters after Iran launched scores of missiles toward Israel late Saturday.

This has led its central bank and consumers to hoard precious metal as a stable store of value and as a way for the People's Bank of China to diversify reserves away from the dollar.\nFor 17 months straight, the PBOC has been gobbling up gold, increasing its holdings by 16% in that time.\nThe World Gold Council reveals India and Singapore have also been scooping up gold to hedge against global economic turbulence.\nGold's soaring demand is turbocharging its prices, with economists predicting the rally to rocket even higher as geopolitical uncertainties and macro hurdles like inflation fuel more gains.\nTop economist David Rosenberg predicts another 15% upswing in the price of the yellow metal, with a potential 30% on the table as central banks consider rate cuts, but he emphasized that gold can rally no matter if the economy ends up having a soft landing or a deeper recession.",

The Rich Gulch claims are located adjacent to the Florida Mountain Deposit at the DeLamar Project (the \"Project\" or \"DeLamar\") in southwestern Idaho.\nRich Gulch is approximately 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) west-southwest of the Florida Mountain Deposit at the base of the Jacobs Gulch stockpile. Control of the Rich Gulch claims at the Project will provide operational flexibility to the Company in future mining and processing scenarios. In the upcoming Feasibility Study, a Development Rock Storage Facility (\"DRSF\") will be located at Rich Gulch to accommodate mining activities at the adjacent Florida Mountain Deposit and Jacobs Gulch stockpile.\nThe Acquisition is expected to close on or about March 8, 2024. Upon closing of the Acquisition, DMC will acquire all of the member interests of Rich Gulch, LLC (\"Rich Gulch LLC\"), the undivided 100% owner of the Rich Gulch claims. The closing of the Acquisition is subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions and consents, including, but not limited to, the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange (the \"TSXV\").\nIntegra's President, CEO & Director, Jason Kosec commented: \"The acquisition of the Rich Gulch claims represents a small, but strategic transaction for Integra. Located immediately adjacent to the Florida Mountain Deposit, Rich Gulch is an efficient location for a DRSF during future mining operations at the Project. Work on an updated mine plan, which includes the use of the Rich Gulch area, is underway and will form the basis of a future Feasibility Study at DeLamar. The Company continues to advance DeLamar through the National Environmental Policy Act permitting process following the submission of the Draft Mine Plan of Operations to the Bureau of Land Management in December 2023. DeLamar is one of the few development projects in the Western United States being advanced towards a construction decision.\"\nSummary Terms of the Acquisition\nUnder the terms of an option agreement (the \"Option Agreement\") as between DMC and an arm's length vendor (the \"Vendor\"), DMC has the Option to purchase all of the member interests of Rich Gulch LLC (the \"Interests\") pursuant to a membership interest purchase agreement (the \"MIPA\"), to be entered into as between DMC and the Vendor. DMC has exercised its option to enter into the MIPA. Under the terms of the MIPA, DMC will acquire all of the Interests in exchange for US$2,100,000 (the \"Purchase Price\"). The Purchase Price is to be satisfied through the issuance of common shares in the capital of the Company (the \"Shares\") based on the five-day volume weighted average price (\"VWAP\") of the Shares preceding the closing date of the Acquisition (the \"Closing Date\"). The MIPA provides that, notwithstanding the VWAP calculation, that in no event shall the number of Shares issued to the Vendor for the Interests be less than 840,000. The MIPA also provides that the parties to the MIPA acknowledge and agree that the regulations of the TSXV with respect to the setting of a floor issue price (that may be different than the VWAP calculation) will apply to the issuance of the Shares.\nThe Shares to be issued will be subject to a statutory hold period of four months and a day, and a voluntary lock-up from which 25% will be released 45 and 90 days, respectively, from the Closing Date, and 50% released on January 3, 2025.\nAs consideration for the grant of the Option pursuant to the Option Agreement, DMC paid to the Vendor US$24,000 in cash.\nNo finder's fees have been paid or are payable in connection with the Acquisition.\nQualified Person\nThe scientific and technical information contained in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Raphael Dutaut, Ph.D (P.Geo), Integra's Vice President, Exploration. Mr. Dutaut is a \"qualified person\" as defined in National Instrument 43- 101 \u2013 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\").\nDeLamar Project Overview\nThe past producing DeLamar Project, which includes the adjacent DeLamar and Florida Mountain gold and silver deposits, is located in Owyhee County in southwest Idaho. Since acquiring the Project in 2017, the Company has demonstrated significant resource growth and conversion while demonstrating robust economic studies in its maiden Preliminary Economic Assessment and Preliminary Feasibility Study. An independent technical report for the DeLamar Project has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of NI 43-101 and is available under the Company's profile at www.sedarplus.ca\nAbout Integra Resources\nIntegra is one of the largest precious metals exploration and development companies in the Great Basin of the Western USA. Integra is currently focused on advancing its two flagship oxide heap leach projects: the past producing DeLamar Project located in southwestern Idaho and the Nevada North Project, comprised of the Wildcat and Mountain View deposits, located in northwestern Nevada. The Company also holds a portfolio of highly prospective early-stage exploration projects in Idaho, Nevada, and Arizona.

Though gold prices dipped by 0.24% on Monday morning, the metal is still trading above $2,300 per ounce.\nBitcoin fell sharply over the weekend but rebounded on Monday morning, rising 3.5%.\nMarkets have steadied amid calls for restraint from world leaders and a statement from President Joe Biden indicating that the US would not participate in a counter-strike against Iran.\nBut developments in the Middle East will remain the main focus for investors this week. If the conflict intensifies, rising oil prices could increase inflationary pressures, while the geopolitical shock could hurt economic growth. However, some analysts said the developments could also bring forward a Federal Reserve rate cut.\n\"As investors brace for further conflict, amid the tragic events unfolding, it's still important to focus on longer-term horizons than short-term uncertainty. The shock of conflict is devastating, but history does point to relatively short-lived volatility on financial markets,\" Hargreaves Lansdown's Susannah Streeter said in a morning note.\nGoldman Sachs is scheduled to report earnings Monday morning and retail sales data for the last month will be released.\nLater this week, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, and Blackstone will report quarterly earnings, and policymakers, including Fed chair Jerome Powell, are set to make comments.\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

That benchmark jumped 5.8%.\nHistory also predicts a brighter year ahead for stocks following an election year: According to Isaac Boltansky, managing director and director of policy research at BTIG, the S&P 500 finished higher in nine of the last 11 years in which a president has been sworn in.\n\"Of course, there are acute sector considerations and there are broader macroeconomic implications, but in general the U.S. economy continues to march forward,\" Boltansky wrote in a note Wednesday.\nAlongside the stock surges were signs that investors are also bracing for an increase in inflation and widening deficits. Investors sold off bonds, causing the 10-year Treasury note yield to rise 17 basis points. When inflation expectations increase, bonds tend to become less valuable if interest rates must also rise.\nOil prices fell, too, as the U.S. dollar soared, on the expectation that Trump's promise to increase tariffs would end up reducing U.S. imports.

The acquisition of Newcrest further cements its position, adding significant reserves and production capacity. This diversity not only mitigates geographical risks but also allows for operational flexibility and economies of scale.\nFinancial Robustness: The financial tables from the recent 10-Q filing underscore Newmont's financial strength. A year-over-year net income increase from $163 million to $924 million is a clear indicator of the company's profitability. With a strong balance sheet, Newmont is well-equipped to invest in growth opportunities, manage debt effectively, and weather market fluctuations. This financial robustness is crucial for sustaining operations and funding exploration and development projects.\nWeaknesses\nOperational Challenges and Costs: Despite its strong market position, Newmont Corp (NYSE:NEM) faces operational challenges that impact its cost structure. The costs applicable to sales have risen from $1,371 million to $2,310 million year-over-year for the third quarter, indicating increased production costs. These challenges, if not managed effectively, could erode the company's competitive advantage and profitability. Additionally, the loss on assets held for sale of $115 million reflects the potential risks associated with the divestment of non-core assets.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks: Newmont's global presence exposes it to a complex web of regulatory environments, which can lead to legal challenges and compliance costs. The ongoing legal proceedings, such as the dispute with the Australian Taxation Office, highlight the potential financial and reputational risks. These uncertainties can divert resources from core operations and impact investor confidence.\nOpportunities\nStrategic Acquisitions and Divestments: The acquisition of Newcrest and the divestment of higher-cost mines present Newmont with opportunities to optimize its asset portfolio and focus on low-cost, long-life operations. These strategic moves can lead to improved operational efficiencies, cost savings, and a stronger focus on the most profitable assets. The potential sale of the Akyem reportable segment to Zijin Mining Group Co., Ltd. is another step towards streamlining operations and focusing on core competencies.\nMarket Position and Commodity Prices: As the market leader, Newmont is well-positioned to capitalize on favorable commodity prices. The company's significant byproduct production of copper, silver, zinc, and lead provides additional revenue streams and hedges against gold price volatility. With a strong market presence and brand reputation, Newmont can leverage its position to secure favorable contracts and partnerships, further bolstering its market dominance.\nThreats\nCommodity Market Volatility: Newmont's reliance on commodity prices, particularly gold, subjects it to market volatility. Fluctuations in gold prices can significantly impact the company's revenue and profitability. While the company does not currently hold instruments to hedge against metal price changes, it must remain vigilant and responsive to market dynamics to protect its bottom line.\nGeopolitical and Macroeconomic Pressures: The company's global operations expose it to geopolitical risks and macroeconomic pressures, such as the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. These factors can lead to supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, and labor market uncertainties, all of which can adversely affect Newmont's operational efficiency and cost structure.\nIn conclusion, Newmont Corp (NYSE:NEM) exhibits a strong financial and strategic position as the world's leading gold miner. Its diverse portfolio, strategic acquisitions, and robust financial performance are key strengths that provide a solid foundation for growth. However, the company must navigate operational challenges, regulatory risks, and market volatility to maintain its competitive edge. By leveraging its opportunities and addressing its threats, Newmont is poised to continue its leadership in the gold mining industry and deliver value to its stakeholders.\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

That's roughly 20,000% higher than its current value.\nSaylor isn't just talking the talk; he reportedly holds about $1 billion in Bitcoin while his company, MicroStrategy, has accumulated 226,500 bitcoins worth about $13.6 billion.\nDoes his bold prediction hold water? Should investors buy Bitcoin at today's prices?\nHere is what you need to know.\nBefore getting too excited about Bitcoin's investment potential, investors should understand that Saylor's price target is remarkably optimistic. Saylor is famously a Bitcoin whale, so it shouldn't shock anyone that he would make a bold prediction. But how much merit does this actually have?\nLet's do some back-of-the-napkin math.\nEven though Bitcoin is priced in dollars, comparing it to gold can help investors understand the valuations of each asset. The Federal Reserve can influence the dollar, but gold, like Bitcoin, is driven more by the free market. Plus, it's valued worldwide, like Bitcoin.\nIf you take all the gold in the world, an estimated 208,874 metric tonnes, and multiply it by its current spot price per ounce of $2,471, you get a total value of about $16.5 trillion. Now, the total supply of gold increased by 3% percent last year, so let's assume (which could be generous) that this grows the same annually for the next 20 years.\nThat would mean the global gold supply would be around 377,357 metric tonnes by 2045. The spot price of gold has risen by 519% during the past 20 years. For this example, I'll assume it rises the same amount between now and 2045. The resulting spot price would be $14,058 per ounce. Do the math over again, and the world's gold supply would hypothetically be worth $170.5 trillion in 2045.\nToday, Bitcoin's market cap, the total market value of all Bitcoin in circulation, is roughly $1.2 trillion. Raising Bitcoin's price by 20,000% from its current level would push its market cap to more than $241 trillion without even factoring in the increase in supply between now and 2045.\nCan Bitcoin displace gold as the underlying asset of the global economy? I won't say it's impossible, but it's a tall task, and that's probably the reality for Bitcoin to grow this large. Investors should probably temper their expectations.\nRemember, the great thing about aiming for the moon is that you can fall short and still land among the stars.\nPrice targets can be high or low, but don't change Bitcoin's trajectory as an anti-inflation asset. Bitcoin isn't new anymore, so it's getting harder to call its investment returns a fluke. Its continually rising value signals that society has actual demand for Bitcoin in the face of the U.S. dollar and other fiat currencies that keep growing weaker as policymakers flood the economy with supply.\nBitcoin is a long way from having true utility in everyday life. Generally speaking, you can't go put gas in your car and pay with Bitcoin. Still, more merchants accept it as payment every year, and corporations and some governments are beginning to accumulate it as a hedge against cash. If this continues, there is no reason Bitcoin's price can't keep rising. It's a digital asset with a fixed supply, priced against a weakening currency (the U.S. dollar).\nBitcoin's price has proven quite volatile, so investors should avoid jumping in with both feet at once. If you want to buy Bitcoin, do it like Michael Saylor does:\nBuy Bitcoin on a schedule, making regular purchases to slowly build an investment at an average price over the long term. Sometimes, you'll buy when it's up, and other times when it's down. However, you'll average out at a number you'll be happy with if Bitcoin continues on its current trajectory.\nBefore you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Bitcoin wasn\u2019t one of them.

When interest rates are low, falling or \u2014 as in this case \u2014 expected to fall, demand for Treasuries ebbs, and gold, which doesn\u2019t pay out any interest, becomes relatively more attractive.\nOver a longer timeframe, gold has benefited from another factor: a deep sense of global unease. Investors typically see the metal as a safe haven since it is a tangible, scarce asset that, in theory, holds its value. However, the tricky part for investors is selling back the physical gold, which can be risky and expensive.\nCNN\u2019s Anna Cooban contributed to this report.\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",

MSCI's all-country index of stocks <.MIWD00000PUS > was up 0.15% at 831.24.\nGold traded above $2,500 per ounce on rate cut expectations and lingering concerns about the Middle East conflict, exacerbated by a major missile exchange between Israel and Hezbollah on Sunday.\nMiddle East tensions - along with concerns about a potential shutdown of Libyan oil fields - had led to a surge in oil prices of more than 7% over the previous three sessions. However, that rally lost steam on Tuesday, with a slight dip in prices. [O/R]\nInvestors were also on edge ahead of Nvidia's earnings report on Wednesday, where anything short of a stellar forecast from the chipmaker could jolt investor confidence in the AI-fuelled rally.\n\"I think the big story today is what's going to happen with Nvidia tomorrow, and this seems to be like what everybody is poised to react and nobody wants to really commit one way or the other,\" said James St. Aubin, chief investment officer at Ocean Park Asset Management in Santa Monica, California.\n\"Nvidia is almost 5% of the S&P 500 earnings contribution and almost 7% of the market cap weight so it's significant in terms of its influence of the overall market.\"\nU.S. consumer confidence rose to a six-month high in August although Americans are becoming more anxious about the labor market, data showed on Tuesday.\nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro, fell 0.3% at 100.55, with the euro up 0.21% at $1.1184.[FRX/]\nPersonal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, a key U.S. inflation measure that is preferred by the Fed, is due on Friday and could further influence market perceptions of how quickly the central bank officials will act.\nThe yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes rose 1.5 basis points to 3.833%. Investors are betting on either a 25-basis point or a 50-basis point interest-rate cut in September, with odds of a 25-bps cut at about 71%, while odds of a 50-bps cut are at about 29%, according to CME Group's Fed Watch tool.",

Here's What Most Really Have\nIvy Grace\n5 min read\nIf you're in your 50s and hear that the \"average\" net worth for people in your age group is over $1 million, you might be tempted to pop a bottle of champagne or stress about why you're not feeling like a millionaire.\nBefore jumping to conclusions, it's worth unpacking what those numbers mean and why most people don't have a seven-figure bank account despite what the averages suggest.\nFirst, the million-dollar figure comes from the average net worth, which is calculated by dividing the total wealth of a group by the number of people in that group. Sounds straightforward, right? The problem is, a few ultra-wealthy individuals \u2013 think tech billionaires and hedge fund moguls \u2013 can skew the average way up.\nNow, the median net worth paints a much more relatable picture. This is the midpoint value, where half of the group has more and half has less. For people in their 50s, the median net worth ranges from $272,800 (ages 50-54) to $320,700 (ages 55-59), according to the Federal Reserve's latest data. That's a far cry from $1 million and much closer to what the \"average Joe\" in their 50s might experience.\nThe disparity comes down to who's pulling the strings \u2013 or in this case, the averages. For every billionaire, there are millions of people with far less wealth and the average lumps all those numbers together. Here's a breakdown of average and median net worth by age group:\nBy comparison, people in their 40s have average net worths between $590,718 and $781,923, with medians sitting far lower. This trend shows that while wealth tends to grow with age, it's not growing equally for everyone.\nWhat's Driving Net Worth in Your 50s?\nSeveral factors contribute to net worth during this phase of life. Home equity is often significant, thanks to years of mortgage payments or soaring real estate prices. Retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs usually account for another chunk and some people have investment portfolios or even business equity boosting their bottom line.\nBut debt can offset all of that. High mortgage balances, credit card debt and even lingering student loans can drag down net worth, especially for those without robust savings or investments.\nYou\u2019re technically ahead if your net worth is above the median for your age group \u2013 around $320,700 for the late 50s. But comparing yourself to an average or median figure isn't the ultimate goal. Whether you're on track for your personal financial and retirement goals matters.\nTo get a clearer picture of where you stand:\nCalculate your net worth by Adding up all assets (home equity, savings, investments) and subtracting liabilities (mortgage, loans, credit card balances).\nCompare to the median: Use benchmarks as a guide, but remember they don't define financial success.\nFocus on your goals: Ask yourself if you're saving enough for retirement, maintaining manageable debt and preparing for future expenses.\nBoosting Your Net Worth in Your 50s\nIf you're feeling like your net worth isn't quite where it should be, there's still time to make strides. Here are some smart strategies:\nInvesting $100 a month starting at age 50 can grow substantially over 10 years, thanks to compound interest. With an average annual return of 6%, your $12,000 contributions could grow to $16,389, while a higher return of 10% could push that to $20,487.\nThe headline-grabbing $1 million average net worth might sound aspirational, but it's far from the reality for most people in their 50s. By understanding the difference between averages and medians \u2013 and focusing on your financial goals \u2013 you can set yourself up for a more secure future, no matter where you currently stand.\nNo matter where you are on your financial journey \u2013 whether you're ahead of the curve or feeling behind \u2013 consulting a financial advisor can make a huge difference. They can help you create a clear plan, maximize your investments and prepare for the future you deserve.\nRead Next:\nInspired by Uber and Airbnb \u2013 Deloitte's fastest-growing software company is transforming 7 billion smartphones into income-generating assets \u2013 with $1,000 you can invest at just $0.26/share!\nUp Next: Transform your trading with Benzinga Edge's one-of-a-kind market trade ideas and tools.

He analyzed 80 years of data on bull-market rallies, focusing on those that happened when unemployment was this low and the economic cycle this mature. If the current rally meets the prior records for length and height, the S&P 500 would end the year at 5,705.\nThe S&P 500 traded less than 1% away from its all-time high. Apple Inc. climbed as Bloomberg News reported the company will deliver some of its upcoming artificial-intelligence features this year via data centers equipped with its own in-house processors. Nvidia Corp. led losses in chipmakers.\nTreasury 10-year yields declined four basis points to 4.46%. The pound rose, despite growing confidence the Bank of England can soon begin loosening policy.\nA survey conducted by 22V Research shows investors are practically split on the S&P 500\u2019s next 10% move \u2014 with 52% betting the benchmark gauge will go higher and 48% seeing a down move.\n\u201cTo the extent that conviction in the next big move in asset prices remains mixed, expect correlations to remain low and stock picking and micro themes to dominate,\u201d said Dennis DeBusschere, founder of 22V.\nWhen it comes to the Treasury market, 68% of those surveyed by the firm believe the 10-year yield is going to 4% next \u2014 while only 32% said 5%.\nSenyek at Wolfe Research noted that he\u2019d remain constructive in equities unless the economy shows signs of spilling into recession, or inflation is sticky enough that the market starts to price in a Fed hike.\n\u201cNeither are part of our base case!\u201d he said.\nInitial applications for US unemployment benefits rose last week to the highest level since August, topping estimates. US policymakers are keeping a close eye on labor demand and wage growth as they debate when it might be appropriate to ease policy. Fed Bank of San Francisco President Mary Daly said rates are currently restraining the economy, but it may take \u201cmore time\u201d to return inflation to their goal.\n\u201cTime will tell whether it\u2019s a one-off or part of a genuine cooldown in the labor market,\u201d said Chris Larkin at E*Trade from Morgan Stanley. \u201cInvestors may have adjusted to the idea of the Fed waiting until September to cut interest rates, but that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re comfortable waiting indefinitely.\u201d\nBlackstone Inc. President Jon Gray said economic growth will slow as stubborn inflation weighs on the Fed\u2019s ability to begin lowering borrowing costs.\n\u201cWe see a deceleration of growth,\u201d Gray said at the Macquarie Australia Conference in Sydney on Thursday. \u201cCentral banks will be slow on the cutting of rates, because they don\u2019t want to see a rise of inflation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Fed will be patient, they\u2019ll have the opportunity to cut once this year,\u201d he added.\nIf the economy is slowing, unemployment rising, inflation receding, and the Fed is expected to cut rates, there will be plenty of buyers for US Treasury notes and bonds, according to Joe Kalish at Ned Davis Research.\n\u201cBut make no mistake. When conditions change, prices can change too \u2013 and quickly!\u201d\nKalish noted that the buyers of bonds are now different from the buyers of bonds during the quantitative-easing era. Currently, buyers are price-sensitive, and the burden has mostly fallen on households, he added.\n\u201cThere will always be a price to clear the market,\u201d he noted. \u201cSo now we are just haggling over the price.\u201d\nCorporate Highlights:\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission is scrutinizing statements that Boeing Co. made about its safety practices following a near-tragic January accident aboard one of its 737 Max 9 planes.\nUnited States Cellular Corp. jumped after a Wall Street Journal report that T-Mobile US Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc. are nearing separate deals to buy parts of the telecommunications company.\nEquinix Inc., a real estate investment trust that owns data centers, surged after saying it has \u201csubstantially\u201d wrapped up an internal investigation of its accounting, which found that its financial reporting has been accurate.\nArm Holdings Plc gave a lukewarm revenue forecast for the fiscal year, raising concerns that the tech industry\u2019s artificial intelligence spending spree is slowing.\nGaming giant Roblox Corp. reported a forecast for bookings that fell short of analysts\u2019 estimates, the latest sign of widespread struggles in the video-game industry.\nGoogle parent Alphabet Inc. has been progressing in talks to acquire marketing software provider HubSpot Inc., according to people familiar with the matter.\nAirbnb Inc. sank after the home-rental company gave lackluster guidance for a second straight quarter, indicating that growth in travel spending will slow ahead of the peak summer season.\nWarner Bros.

(\u201cFirst Quantum\u201d or the \"Company\u201d) (TSX: FM) today reports results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 (\u201cQ1 2024\u201d or the \"first quarter\") of a net loss attributable to shareholders of the Company of $159 million ($0.21 loss per share) and an adjusted loss1 of $154 million ($0.20 adjusted loss per share2).\n\u201cThe successful completion of a comprehensive refinancing package during the first quarter of this year has strengthened the Company\u2019s balance sheet significantly and it has unlocked the time and financial headroom needed to secure the successful delivery of the Kansanshi S3 Expansion. The Company\u2019s outlook reflects First Quantum\u2019s enduring commitment to the success of our Zambian operations. We recognize the challenges Zambia faces from the drought this year, particularly in regard to food security, even as we are pleased to be finalizing agreements to ensure adequate power supply to Trident and Kansanshi. Beyond this, the Company remains focused on evaluating additional measures to manage its balance sheet ever more prudently,\u201d commented Tristan Pascall, Chief Executive Officer of First Quantum. \"Panama holds its presidential election in early May and a new president will be inaugurated in July. Clearly, throughout this period of change, the environmental stability and asset integrity of Cobre Panam\u00e1 remains a priority for the Company. First Quantum will continue to work with the current administration to implement the Cobre Panam\u00e1 Preservation and Safe Management plan.\"\nQ1 2024 SUMMARY\nIn Q1 2024, First Quantum reported gross profit of $156 million, EBITDA1 of $180 million, a net loss attributable to shareholders of $0.21 per share, and an adjusted loss per share2 of $0.20. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2023 (\u201cQ4 2023\u201d), first quarter financial results were negatively impacted by the disruptions experienced at the Cobre Panam\u00e1 mine which led to the mine being placed in a phase of Preservation and Safe Management (\"P&SM\") since November 2023.\nAlong with the Q1 2024 financial and operational results, there were a number of developments during the quarter that are detailed in the news release.\n-\nDue to a National Emergency in Zambia, in response to a drought aggravated by El Ni\u00f1o, ZESCO revealed a plan to reduce power supply to the mining sector over the period from May 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024. First Quantum received a force majeure notice from ZESCO to formalize their request for power reductions. This procedural step will allow First Quantum to secure power independently from alternative sources. First Quantum is in the process of finalizing binding offtake agreements with third party traders for power sourced from the Southern African Power Pool for a total of 80 MW currently, which may be expanded if forecasts of power reductions in Zambia change. The Company anticipates that it will be able to substitute the power curtailed by ZESCO with imports, thereby avoiding any major interruptions to its Zambian operations.\n-\nThe previously announced comprehensive refinancing and balance sheet strengthening initiatives were completed, providing the Company with much stronger liquidity and a solid financial position on which to deliver its operational objectives.\n-\nCobre Panam\u00e1 continues to work on the P&SM program. Approximately 121 thousand dry metric tonnes of copper concentrate remains onsite. The Attorney General of Panama, Rigoberto Gonz\u00e1lez, advised on January 29, 2024, that \u201cminerals extracted through mining concessions granted in accordance with the Mining Code belong to the concessionaire\u201d.\n-\nThe Kansanshi S3 Expansion project continued on track during the quarter. The first quarter of 2024 has been focused on site construction activities with the installation of large mechanical equipment (e.g. SAG Mill, primary crusher) commenced. Site activities were unaffected by the rainy season. The majority of the capital spend on the S3 Expansion is expected to occur in 2024, with first production expected in 2025.\n1 EBITDA and adjusted earnings (loss) are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and might not be comparable to similar financial measures disclosed by other issuers. See \u201cRegulatory Disclosures\u201d.\n2 Adjusted earnings (loss) per share is a non-GAAP ratio which does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and might not be comparable to similar financial measures disclosed by other issuers. See \u201cRegulatory Disclosures\u201d.\nQ1 2024 OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS\nWith Cobre Panam\u00e1 in a phase of P&SM, total copper production for the first quarter was 100,605 tonnes, a 37% decrease from Q4 2023. Copper sales volumes totaled 101,776 tonnes, approximately 1,171 tonnes higher than production. Copper C1 cash cost1 was $0.20 per lb higher quarter-over-quarter to $2.02 per lb due to the lower production. Excluding Cobre Panam\u00e1, copper production was 3,021 tonnes higher quarter-over-quarter resulting from improved mining conditions at Sentinel, while copper C1 cash cost1 were lower by $0.06 per lb at $2.01 per lb.\n-\nKansanshi\u2019s copper production of 31,473 tonnes in Q1 2024 was 414 tonnes lower than the previous quarter as a result of weaker grades, partially offset by improved throughput. Grades were weaker quarter-over-quarter due to an unplanned smelter shutdown in February, which impacted acid stock availability and restricted the ability to treat high-grade ore. Despite lower production volumes, copper C1 cash cost1 of $2.34 per lb was $0.09 lower quarter-over-quarter mainly due to the absence of a one-time catch-up charge on new electricity rates in Q4 2023 following a new ten-year power supply agreement with ZESCO that was entered into at the end of 2023. Production guidance for 2024 is maintained at 130,000 to 150,000 tonnes of copper and 65,000 to 75,000 ounces of gold. Copper grades are expected to improve over the course of the year as mining progresses at higher elevation areas with higher-grade material from M15 and M17 cutbacks.\n-\nSentinel reported copper production of 62,225 tonnes in Q1 2024 was 2,261 tonnes higher than the previous quarter mainly due to an improvement in grades as mining activity was able to progress as planned with ore accessed from the bottom of Stage 1 and the high-grade material from the saddle zone between Stage 1 and Stage 2. Throughput, however, was lower than the fourth quarter of 2023 due to a planned total plant shutdown that occurred in January 2024 that was deferred from 2023. Despite the higher production volumes in Q1 2024, copper C1 cash cost1 of $1.85 per lb is unchanged from the preceding quarter, reflecting higher electricity rates from the new power supply agreement with ZESCO and higher freight costs associated with the higher volumes of concentrate sold during the quarter. Copper production guidance for 2024 is maintained at 220,000 to 250,000 tonnes. Copper grades are expected to normalize for the remainder of the year after an exceptionally strong first quarter, while throughput is expected to improve over the course of the year with the development of Stage 3 (Western Cut-back) progressing well that will enable improved mining productivities and increased availability of softer material from higher elevations.\n-\nEnterprise produced 4,031 tonnes of nickel during the first quarter, an increase from 2,751 tonnes in Q4 2023, reflecting a ramp up of mining operations. In the first quarter, additional equipment was mobilized to increase mining volumes. The Jameson cell and one of the two additional columns to expand the cleaner circuit have been commissioned with a noticeable improvement in recovery. The second column is expected to be commissioned in the second quarter. The focus remains on the stripping of waste and the final ramp-up of the process plant to full production capacity, which has been challenged by the metallurgical characteristics of the shallow ore. Recovery and concentrate quality are continuously improving as supply of the fresher sulphide ore increases, consistent with expectations from the geo-metallurgical understanding of the deposit. Commercial production and full plant throughput is expected later in 2024. Production guidance in 2024 is 10,000 to 20,000 contained tonnes of nickel.\n1 C1 cash cost (C1) is a non-GAAP ratio, which does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and might not be comparable to similar financial measures disclosed by other issuers. See \u201cRegulatory Disclosures\u201d\n-\nCobre Panam\u00e1 currently remains in a phase of P&SM. During the quarter, the process plant went through a 14-day preservation and maintenance cycle, with equipment being run and monitored for periods to help maintain the equipment in good working condition. Furthermore, all the major ultra-class mobile equipment is in a maintenance cycle that involves daily inspections and weekly start-up and running of the assets. This equipment will be required as part of the P&SM plan that is awaiting approval by the Ministry of Commerce and Industries (\u201cMICI\"). Through the course of the first quarter of 2024, Cobre Panam\u00e1 sent to the National Authority of Public Services (\u201cASEP\u201d), the request to extend the Auto-generator certificate, which is required to put the generation units of the power plant into operation. The restart of the power plant is a critical area for the ongoing implementation of the P&SM plan and the Company is actively engaged with ASEP in this respect. Excluding one-time severance charges for employees, the costs for the P&SM program in the first quarter were approximately $20 million per month, which included labor, maintenance spares, contractor\u2019s services, electricity, and other general expenses. For the remainder of the year, P&SM expenses are expected to range from $15 - $20 million per month, depending on the level of environmental stability and asset integrity programs. The Company is actively managing the P&SM costs of Cobre Panam\u00e1 and will adjust the level of employment and cost of these activities according to the conditions on the ground in Panama.\n-\nAt Ravensthorpe, nickel production for the first quarter totaled 3,740 contained tonnes of nickel. Production for the quarter was lower than expected mainly due to lower throughput rates and leach extractions which was predominantly limited by capacity constraints on the Atmospheric Leach. Despite the transition to a new operating strategy announced subsequent to the year-end, maintenance challenges continue to impact production certainty and weak nickel prices, lower payabilities and high operating costs have continued to result in significant margin pressure. Production guidance remains at 12,000 \u2013 17,000 contained tonnes of nickel per annum.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nFinancial results continue to be impacted by Cobre Panam\u00e1 in a phase of P&SM.\n-\nGross profit for the first quarter of $156 million was $69 million higher than the fourth quarter of last year, while EBITDA1 of $180 million for the same period was $93 million lower.\n-\nCash flows from operating activities of $411 million ($0.55 per share2) for the quarter were $596 million higher than the fourth quarter of last year.\nThe previously disclosed comprehensive refinancing and balance sheet strengthening initiatives were completed in the first quarter, providing the Company with strong liquidity, sustainable leverage, and a solid financial position on which to deliver its operational objectives. These transactions include:\n-\nExecution of a copper prepayment agreement with Jiangxi Copper, resulting in gross proceeds of $500 million.\n-\nAmendments to the Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility, providing additional liquidity headroom and increases the net leverage covenant from 3.50x to 5.75x Net Debt/EBITDA until June 30, 2025. The net leverage covenant will be reduced to 5.00x between July 1, 2025 and December 31, 2025; 4.25x between January 1, 2026 and June 30, 2026; and 3.75x thereafter.\n-\nCompletion of the offering of $1,600 million 9.375% senior secured second-lien notes due 2029, along with the bought deal equity offering detailed below, allowing the Company to redeem in full its $1,050 million and $1,000 million aggregate principal amount senior notes that were due in 2025 and 2026, respectively.\n-\nIssuance of 139,932,000 common shares (including an over-allotment option) from the previously disclosed bought deal equity offering resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $1,150 million (C$1,553 million).\n1 EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure which does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and might not be comparable to similar financial measures disclosed by other issuers. See \u201cRegulatory Disclosures\u201d.\n2 Cash flows from operating activities per share is a non-GAAP ratio, which does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and might not be comparable to similar financial measures disclosed by other issuers. See \u201cRegulatory Disclosures\u201d.\nThe completion of the above refinancing transactions, offset by changes in working capital, resulted in a decrease in the Company's net debt1 position by $1,143 million during the quarter, taking net debt1 to $5,277 million and total debt to $5,988 million as at March 31, 2024 (net debt1 was $6,420 million and total debt was $7,379 million at December 31, 2023).\nThe Company continues to pursue previously announced measures to prudently manage the balance sheet for optionality and flexibility, including a sales process for the Las Cruces mine in Spain, as well as a potential minority investment in the Company's Zambian business.\n1Net debt is a supplementary financial measure which does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and might not be comparable to similar financial measures disclosed by other issuers.

In response to reduced water levels in the Kafue River and Zambezi basins, ZESCO announced a comprehensive power management plan. This plan involves a targeted reduction in power generation across the country as a whole by a total of 700 MW to mitigate the impact of the drought on the nation's power supply.\nStarting March 11, 2024, ZESCO implemented 8-hour daily load shedding for its retail customers. Additionally, after the National Emergency was declared, ZESCO began a series of consultations on a bilateral basis with Zambia\u2019s mining companies. During these consultations, ZESCO revealed a plan to reduce power supply to the mining sector by a total of 150 MW, over the period from May 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024. First Quantum's combined operations are expected to have its power curtailed by approximately 80 MW over this period. Consequently, on April 11, 2024, First Quantum received a force majeure notice from ZESCO to formalize their request for power reductions. This procedural step will allow First Quantum to secure power independently from alternative sources.\nIn anticipation of these challenges, First Quantum is in the process of finalizing binding offtake agreements with third party traders for power sourced from the Southern African Power Pool for a total of 80 MW currently, which may be expanded if forecasts of power reductions in Zambia change. These vendors are securing the necessary power required by the Company\u2019s Zambian operations from Mozambique's Electricidade de Mo\u00e7ambique and Namibia's NamPower. The Company estimates that impact of sourcing of power from these other sources would be $25 million for the remainder of the year, approximately $0.03 per lb impact on cash costs1.\nFirst Quantum has also signed a letter of intent with ZESCO to support improved power quality across the national grid. Under the terms of the arrangement, First Quantum will provide upfront funding for ZESCO to install Static VAR Compensator units which are expected to improve the quality and availability of power on the national grid. The funding will be recovered by deductions on ZESCO\u2019s monthly invoices to Trident and Kansanshi.\nThe Company is advancing a 430 MW of solar and wind project with TotalEnergies and Chariot Energy. The expected commissioning date of the solar and wind component is 2026 and 2027, respectively. Furthermore, the Company is in advanced discussions with Zambian hydro scheme project developers with sites in Northwest and Northern Provinces of Zambia. The combined baseload power of these projects is 50MW. These sites have more favorable hydrology than Zambia\u2019s south, where most of Zambia\u2019s current generation are located.\nAt this stage, based on current power supply and demand forecasts, the Company anticipates that it will be able to substitute the power curtailed by ZESCO with imports, thereby avoiding any major interruptions to its Zambian operations.\n1 Realized metal price, C1 cash cost (C1), and All-in sustaining cost (AISC) are non-GAAP ratio which does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and might not be comparable to similar financial measures disclosed by other issuers. See \u201cRegulatory Disclosures\u201d.\nCOBRE PANAM\u00c1 UPDATE\nCobre Panam\u00e1 experienced illegal blockades in November 2023 at the Punta Rinc\u00f3n port and at the roads to the site that prevented the delivery of supplies that were necessary to operate the power plant, which led to the suspension of production at the end of November 2023 and placed the mine into a phase of P&SM. Cobre Panam\u00e1 currently remains in a phase of P&SM with approximately 1,400 workers remaining on site to run the program. Previous illegal blockages around the mine have since dissipated, allowing for the delivery by road and at port of necessary supplies to conduct the P&SM program. The Company is actively managing the P&SM costs of Cobre Panam\u00e1 and will adjust the level of employment and cost of these activities according to the conditions on the ground in Panama.\nThe Company is working with the Ministry of Commerce and Industries (\u201cMICI\u201d) to implement environmental stability and asset integrity measures. As part of these measures, a phase of environmental P&SM was established until June 2024, during which intervening period independent audits, review and planning activities would be undertaken. It was noted by the Government of Panama (\u201cGOP\u201d) that the planning would take up to two years, and 10 years or more to implement.\nAt the request of MICI, Cobre Panam\u00e1 delivered a preliminary draft for the first phase of P&SM on January 16, 2024. Consequently, on February 27, 2024, MICI issued a resolution indicating that the Ministries of Labor, Safety, Health, Industries and Commerce, and Environment would carefully review the plan. In early March 2024, MICI requested some clarifications and additional information with respect to the P&SM plan, to which Cobre Panam\u00e1 submitted an updated and expanded preservation plan at the end of March 2024. Subsequently, in early April 2024, government delegations, including representation from various ministries undertook site inspection and verification visits.\nSteps towards two arbitration proceedings have been taken by the Company, one under the Canada-Panama Free Trade Agreement (\"FTA\"), and another one as per the arbitration clause of the Refreshed Concession Contract.\n-\nOn November 29, 2023, the Company initiated arbitration before the International Chamber of Commerce\u2019s International Court of Arbitration (\u201cICC\u201d) pursuant to the ICC\u2019s Rules of Arbitration and Clause 46 of the Refreshed Concession Contract, to protect its rights under Panamanian law and the Refreshed Concession Contract that the Government of Panama (\"GOP\") agreed to in October 2023. The arbitration clause of the contract provides for arbitration in Miami, Florida.\n-\nOn November 14, 2023, First Quantum submitted a notice of intent to the GOP initiating the consultation period required under the FTA. First Quantum submitted an updated notice of intent on February 7, 2024. Under the terms of the FTA, First Quantum may initiate arbitration after at least six months have elapsed since the events giving rise to a claim. First Quantum is entitled to seek any and all relief appropriate in arbitration, including but not limited to damages and reparation for Panama\u2019s breaches of the Canada-Panama FTA. These breaches include, among other things, the GOP's failure to permit MPSA to lawfully operate the Cobre Panam\u00e1 mine prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s November 2023 decision, and the GOP's pronouncements and actions concerning closure plans and P&SM at Cobre Panam\u00e1.\n2024 GUIDANCE\nGuidance is based on a number of assumptions and estimates as of March 31, 2024, including among other things, assumptions about metal prices and anticipated costs and expenditures.

Realized metal prices are calculated as gross metal sales revenues divided by the volume of metal sold in lbs. Net realized metal price is inclusive of the treatment and refining charges (TC/RC) and freight charges per lb.\nOPERATING CASHFLOW PER SHARE\nIn calculating the operating cash flow per share, the operating cash flow calculated for IFRS purposes is divided by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding for the respective period.\nNET DEBT\nNet debt is comprised of bank overdrafts and total debt less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.\nCASH COST, ALL-IN SUSTAINING COST, TOTAL COST\nThe consolidated cash cost (C1), all-in sustaining cost (AISC) and total cost (C3) presented by the Company are measures that are prepared on a basis consistent with the industry standard definitions by the World Gold Council and Brook Hunt cost guidelines but are not measures recognized under IFRS. In calculating the C1 cash cost, AISC and C3, total cost for each segment, the costs are measured on the same basis as the segmented financial information that is contained in the financial statements.\nC1 cash cost includes all mining and processing costs less any profits from by-products such as gold, silver, zinc, pyrite, cobalt, sulphuric acid, or iron magnetite and is used by management to evaluate operating performance. TC/RC and freight deductions on metal sales, which are typically recognized as a component of sales revenues, are added to C1 cash cost to arrive at an approximate cost of finished metal.\nAISC is defined as cash cost (C1) plus general and administrative expenses, sustaining capital expenditure, deferred stripping, royalties and lease payments and is used by management to evaluate performance inclusive of sustaining expenditure required to maintain current production levels.\nC3 total cost is defined as AISC less sustaining capital expenditure, deferred stripping and general and administrative expenses net of insurance, plus depreciation and exploration.

        "full_text": "Gold prices have another 29% upside as China's central bank continues its buying spree, famed economist says\n-\nGold prices are set to continue their record bull run to $3,000 per ounce, according to David Rosenberg.\n-\nRosenberg highlighted a buying spree from China's central bank as one reason why prices will rise.\n-\nRosenberg said that the Federal Reserve's upcoming easing cycle should also boost gold prices.\nFamed economist David Rosenberg is feeling good about where gold prices are headed.\nIn a note on Monday, Rosenberg outlined why he expects gold prices to continue their record bull run to $3,000 per ounce, representing potential upside of 29% from current levels.\nRosenberg said China's central bank is on a gold buying spree, having bought gold reserves for 17 months in a row, and it could have a lot more to buy up as it pushes its gold reserves to levels comparable with other central banks.\n\"China's drift from the US is behind its slow but steady rotation from US dollar reserves to gold \u2014 and also means the end of the yuan as a potential second reserve currency (pushing other central banks back toward gold),\" Rosenberg said.\nOver the past year, China alone has purchased about 181 tonnes of gold, and it's now the sixth-largest holder of gold reserves, bringing its share of total reserves to 4.3% in March. But its share of gold reserves is tiny compared to other central banks, with the global average being 13%.\nThat means there could be plenty of runway left for China to keep adding to its gold reserves.\n\"The US holds 70% of its reserves in gold. So there is incredible room to run for the PBOC over the next few years just to approach the global benchmark of gold reserves,\" Rosenberg said.\nIf China added just one more percentage point of gold to its reserves, that would imply 420 tonnes of gold, which alone would consume 11% of new production.\nAside from China's central bank continuing its buying spree, Rosenberg said other factors that could help boost the price of gold to $3,000 per ounce include increased demand from investors via gold ETFs as geopolitical tensions remain heightened and the start of the Federal Reserve's easing cycle.\nIf and when the Fed starts to cut interest rates, that will help boost demand for gold, according to Rosenberg.\n\"That's the event that would bring $3,000 per ounce into view,\" Rosenberg said.\nWhile the Fed is no longer expected to cut interest rates seven times this year due to a resilient economy, it is still expected to launch its first interest rate cut later this year.\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

In general, under the Colombian Tax Code, dividends and distributions out of profits taxed at the corporate level to non-resident shareholders are subject to a 10% withholding tax. However, the 10% withholding tax is reduced to 5% under the Tax Treaty between Colombia and Canada if the shareholder is a company with a participation larger than 10% in the Colombian company distributing the dividend. The reduced tax rate is only applicable if the beneficial owner of the dividend is a Canadian resident company. If the beneficial owner is an individual, no reduced tax rate will apply.\nThe approved dividend is in line with the Company's dividend policy, which is to pay in dividends at least 15% of the net income of the prior fiscal year, provided that this allows, in good faith, to maximize the long-term value of the Company.\nElection of Directors\nThe Board of Directors of Mineros is elected in accordance with the Colombian electoral quotient system.

Here\u2019s who isn\u2019t buying.\nBitcoin BTCUSD reached a fresh record on Friday too, topping $70,000. On March 7, the S&P 500 index SPX set a record close at 5,157.36, while the Nasdaq Composite COMP closed at a record 16,274.94 on March 1.\nAlso read: There\u2019s one big mystery in the everything rally: gold\u2019s record-setting ascent\nThere has been \u201ca lot of liquidity on the sidelines\u201d in relatively high yielding Treasurys, which have been looking less attractive as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicates the Fed is close to cutting interest rates, and as riskier assets appreciate, said Pickard.\nHe expects continued market strength across gold, bitcoin, U.S. stocks, and other markets, as this money gets deployed into riskier assets. Other global stock markets hitting all-time highs include Japan. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 JP:NIK set a record on March 4 at 40,109.23.\n\u201cValuations across markets are rising as anticipation of interest rate cuts grows,\u201d said Jason Schenker, president of Prestige Economics.\n\u201cWith a prospect of looser U.S. monetary policy, asset values are poised to rise,\u201d he told MarketWatch. \u201cThis is likely to support everything from U.S. equities to residential real-estate prices.\u201d\nThe U.S. dollar is also likely to weaken on Fed rate cuts, and geopolitical tensions are high and rising \u2013 \u201cboth of which are supportive of gold prices.\u201d\nBitcoin vs. gold\nBitcoin, meanwhile, is benefiting from the prospect of Fed interest rate cuts, a weaker dollar, and geopolitical tensions, said Schenker.\n\u201cA swarm of hype locusts have been buying into bitcoin following SEC spot Bitcoin ETF approvals earlier this year and ahead of next month\u2019s redemption halving,\u201d he said. Halving is a mechanism written into the Bitcoin blockchain\u2019s algorithm to control the coin\u2019s limited supply.\nRead: Bitcoin is halving again in April. Here\u2019s why it\u2019s different this time.\nBitcoin exchange-traded funds have performed well since they started trading in January. As of March 7, the iShares Bitcoin ETF IBIT, for example, has seen a net fund inflow of about $9.45 billion since Jan. 12, according to Dow Jones Market Data analysis of FactSet data. Among gold ETFs, however, SPDR Gold Shares GLD has seen year-to-date net fund outflow of $4.15 billion.\nBitcoin is a \u201cdigitally native asset,\u201d while gold is a \u201cphysical asset\u201d \u2013 one that investors can hold in their hand, said Research Affiliates\u2019 Pickard. That\u2019s an attractive quality of gold, he said, so gold prices are going up through physical purchases, while gold ETFs experience outflows.\nOn the other hand, for many investors, a bitcoin ETF is \u201ca safer and easier way to access bitcoin than to buy the actual coin,\u201d so bitcoin prices are going up through ETF purchases, Pickard said.\nRead: Did bitcoin ETF frenzy drive the crypto to a record? How the experts see it.\nPickard expects bitcoin to lure investors away from gold, with the \u201clure\u201d being the \u201cmedia, traditional and social, and word-of-mouth.\u201d\n\u201cWe are living in an attention economy, and bitcoin gets more attention than gold,\u201d he said, adding bitcoin investors are likely growing faster than gold investors.\nEven so, gold and bitcoin can both see prices rise because of \u201cmore buying than selling within both markets,\u201d said Pickard. \u201cI expect both assets to go up, but for bitcoin to outperform gold.\u201d\nS&P 500 vs. gold\nMeanwhile, looking at gold\u2019s changes in value versus the U.S. stock market, or the S&P 500 index more specifically, can help gauge investor confidence.\nComparing gold with the S&P 500 over time can provide \u201ca sense of whether equity investor confidence is rising or falling, and when it might be excessively optimistic or pessimistic,\u201d Jessica Rabe, co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a note this week.\nShe pointed out that S&P 500/gold price ratio does a \u201cgreat job of highlighting long-term trends in equity investor sentiment.\u201d\nThe S&P 500 trading at 2.4 times the price of gold is within one standard deviation of the long run average of 1.6, she said. So \u201cneither stocks nor gold is materially mispriced relative to the other asset based on this long run math,\u201d said Rabe.\nPickard, meanwhile, said that the ratio reading of 2.4, \u201cwhich it has been around for about 5 years,\u201d indicates that investors are \u201cboth equally confident in the S&P 500 and gold.\u201d\nA break above 2.75 would indicate increased equity investor confidence relative to gold, while a drop below 2.0 would indicate more investor confidence in gold versus equities, he said.",

With a focus on shovel-ready projects and a strategic location in a mining-friendly jurisdiction, U.S. Gold Corp aims to capitalize on rising gold prices. The company generates revenue primarily through the development of its mineral assets, particularly the CK Gold Project in Wyoming. This project is one of the few permitted and shovel-ready gold and copper endeavors in North America, allowing for a streamlined path to production. U.S. Gold Corp plans to leverage its gold and copper reserves to maximize profit margins. With rising gold prices and stable energy costs, the company stands to benefit significantly as market conditions favor gold mining operations.\nInvesting in U.S. Gold Corp presents a compelling opportunity for several reasons. The ongoing bull market in gold is expected to continue, with experts like Chris Gaffney predicting prices could reach $3,000 per ounce by 2025. This positive outlook indicates that mining companies, including U.S. Gold Corp, can anticipate increased profit margins and expanded operations. Despite the historic rise in gold prices, gold mining equities remain undervalued. Analysts at HC Wainwright & Co. and Alliance Global Partners have set a price target of over $13 per share for U.S. Gold Corp, significantly higher than its recent trading range of $5 to $6. This discrepancy highlights the potential for substantial capital appreciation.\nU.S. Gold Corp holds a competitive advantage with its CK Gold Project, located on state-owned land in Wyoming, one of the safest and most mining-friendly jurisdictions. The absence of federal regulations has expedited the permitting process, benefiting ongoing development. Additionally, the company\u2019s copper resources provide a hedge for investors who may not be as bullish on gold, allowing for diversification within the asset portfolio. The anticipated influx of capital into the sector, as the gold bull cycle becomes recognized by generalist investors, combined with continued value creation at the CK Gold Project, could drive U.S. Gold Corp toward its historical highs. In conclusion, U.S. Gold Corp offers a promising investment opportunity in the gold sector, driven by favorable market conditions, undervalued equities, strategic asset positioning, and diversification potential.",

The analyst notes that the International Monetary Fund predicts new spending could amount to 7%-8% of global GDP annually by 2030.\n\"Ultimately, something has to give: if markets become reluctant to absorb all the debt and volatility increases, gold may become the asset of choice. Central banks in particular could further diversify their currency reserves,\" the analysts wrote.\nWith neither candidate for the upcoming US presidential election prioritizing fiscal discipline and a pullback in spending, national debt is projected to hit a record high as a share of the economy in the next three years, the analysts said.\nThat will increase interest payments as a share of GDP, making gold an attractive asset amid concerns that markets won't be able to absorb new debt, they add.\n\"Indeed, with lingering concerns over US funding needs and their impact on the US Treasury market, the yellow metal may become the ultimate perceived safe haven asset,\" the analysts said.\nThe analysts reaffirmed their target of $3,000 an ounce for gold by the end of next year, which implies 11.1% upside from levels on Thursday.\nThe analysts' bullishness for the metal comes as worries grow over mounting spending and debt around the world.\nInvestors have increasingly looked to gold in recent weeks as the Federal Reserve kicked off its easing cycle with a 50-basis point interest rate cut last month, driving the price of gold to gain around 4.3% in the last month.\nCentral banks around the world have also increased their share of gold as a portion of total reserves. The Bank of America analysts note that gold now makes up 10% of central bank reserves, up from 3% a decade ago.\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

Among the factors favouring this are geopolitical uncertainty, the likely weakening of the U.S. dollar, and potential interest rate cuts. But before relying on these factors in the future, we must understand how they have influenced the past.\nFor the past 90 years, the value of gold has depended primarily on the volume of transactions between the Western and Eastern markets. Western countries determined supply and demand, while Eastern countries acted as counterparties to the transaction. Thus, when the volumes of physical gold purchased by Great Britain or Switzerland increased, its price grew, and vice versa. As a result, gold moved from the West to the East and back synchronously with the price decreasing or increasing.\nThe second factor that has historically influenced the price is the relationship between the price of gold and the real yield on U.S. government bonds. When the real yield decreased, bonds lost their appeal, and investors moved into gold. Once the trend reversed and real yields began to rise, investors returned to bonds.\nHowever, since the end of 2022, both patterns have failed. The U.S. ten-year bond yield rose to 4.33%, above the 2022 highs, beating a 15-year record. Despite expectations, this didn\u2019t lower the price of gold, which instead rose from November 2022 to August 2023 by 16%, from $1,643 to $1,954 per ounce.\nThe correlation between gold transaction volumes and the gold price also stopped working. Since the third quarter of 2022, the UK and Switzerland have been Netto-exporters of gold, i.e. sellers. According to the historical paradigm, this should also have been a reason for the price of gold to fall. However, as we can see, this is not happening. Thus, the West has not significantly influenced the pricing of precious metals.\nEscalating geopolitical conflicts are causing gold to rise in value. Due to the geopolitical events of 2022, dollar assets have become more risky for many countries. Central banks in the Global South, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East have been actively pursuing a policy of building up the gold part of foreign exchange reserves since the end of 2022. According to a World Gold Council (WGC) report, central banks bought 800 tonnes of gold in the first nine months of 2023, up 14% year-on-year. Excess demand from central banks has boosted the value of gold by 10 per cent in 2023.\n\u2018It is the central banks\u2019 purchases of gold that will act as the main driver of growth in 2024\u2032, said Kar Yong Ang, the Octa financial market analyst. \u2018If the trend continues and the level of gold reserves moves towards an average of 40% of the gold composition in reserves, that would mean an additional $3.2 trillion in the asset\u2014a 25% rise in 2025, which would correspond to a price of $2,500 an ounce\u2019, he added.\nGold has also seen another rise since the beginning of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict: since October 2023, it has added more than 8%. Hence, we can conclude that any aggravation in geopolitics will have a positive impact on gold.\nThe stabilisation of inflation will continue to support gold quotes. In 2022, global inflation reached its highest levels in decades. However, it is also a fact that inflation passed its peak at the end of 2023. Most analysts believe inflationary pressures will continue to ease in 2024.\n\u2018Traditionally, the gold price has been negatively correlated with the inflation rate. The lower the inflation rate, the lower the interest rates on government bonds. As a result, the relative attractiveness of non-interest-bearing assets such as gold increases\u2019, said Kar Yong Ang.\nDeveloping economies de-dollarisation. Investors see gold as an alternative means of building savings and protection against inflation and currency risk. Demand for gold is increasing because Brazil, Russia, India, and China (members of BRICKS) seek ways to improve their currency independence.\nThe main factors affecting gold\u2019s price are inflation, rising demand from central banks, de-dollarisation of developing economies, microeconomic situation, and geopolitics. The combination of these factors will create conditions for the growth of gold price in 2024\u2014in the first half of the year, the cost of the precious metal may exceed $2,200 per troy ounce. In the second half of the year, the upward trend in gold is likely to continue, and gold may show a price of $2,300 per ounce, so the average price in 2024 will be $2,170.\nOcta is an international broker that has been providing online trading services worldwide since 2011.

Here's how\n\u201cIt cost me $130 to fill up my SUV two days ago. People can't afford life anymore,\u201d he lamented.\nIn recent years, many Americans have experienced sticker shock at the gas station. Gas prices reached a record high in June 2022, with regular unleaded gasoline averaging $5.016 per gallon, as reported by the American Automobile Association (AAA). Prices have since retreated, with AAA noting that the average price for regular gas was $3.222 per gallon as of Sept. 20.\nBut is Trump\u2019s gas bill an exaggeration? If not, it\u2019s time to start strategizing how you can better protect the value of your dollar.\nTrump\u2019s claim about his $130 fill-up sparked a wave of skepticism online.\n\u201cWhat kind of SUV is he driving? Mine costs me about $55 at Costco gas,\u201d commented lawyer Bradley P. Moss on X.\nAnother X user, Lisa Deeley Smith from Arlington, Massachusetts, questioned the math, stating, \u201cIf he has a 20-gallon tank, he's paying $6.50 a gallon.\u201d\nThis price per gallon would be significantly higher than the national average price of $3.261 for regular gas reported by AAA during the week of Trump's interview.\nThe cost to fill up a vehicle can vary greatly, depending on the size of the gas tank, the type of fuel used and the location of the gas station. Is a $130 fill-up feasible? Let\u2019s crunch the numbers.\nTrump did not disclose the make and model of his vehicle. However, the current generation Chevrolet Suburban \u2014 an SUV frequently used by the Secret Service \u2014 boasts a large 28-gallon fuel tank.\nCalifornia typically reports the highest gas prices in the U.S. According to AAA, during the week of the interview, the price for premium gasoline in California was $5.109 per gallon.\nTherefore, if Trump were filling up a Suburban in California from empty with premium fuel, he would be paying 28 x $5.109 = $143.052. Thus, a gas bill around $130 is within the realm of possibility.\nRead more: Rich, young Americans are ditching the stormy stock market \u2014 here are the alternative assets they're banking on instead\nWhether you buy into Trump's $130 fill-up story or not, the reality is that inflation affects everyone by eroding the purchasing power of money \u2014 and gasoline is just one example. And although the headline inflation rate has seen a decline since its peak in 2022, it\u2019s the rate of increase that has eased, not the high prices themselves. Many essential items, in particular, continue to be priced at elevated levels.\nFor instance, the food CPI has increased by 26% since the beginning of 2020. Similarly, the shelter index has risen by 24% during the same period.\nThe silver lining? Nowadays, there are plenty of accessible strategies for investors to shield themselves from inflation\u2019s bite.\nReal estate is a well-known hedge against inflation. As the price of raw materials and labor goes up, new properties are more expensive to build. This drives up the price of existing real estate.\nWell-chosen properties can provide more than just price appreciation. Investors also get to earn a steady stream of rental income. Since rent typically increases with inflation, this creates an effective hedge against the diminishing purchasing power, thereby preserving and potentially enhancing the investor\u2019s real income over time.\nOver the last five years, the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-City Composite Home Price NSA Index has surged 54%.\nOf course, that also means properties are not cheap these days, especially with elevated mortgage rates.\nBut you don\u2019t need to buy a house to start investing in real estate. There are plenty of real estate investment trusts (REITs) as well as crowdfunding platforms that offer everyday investors access to institutional-quality property portfolios, allowing them to earn rental income without the responsibilities of being a landlord.\nGold is another well-known hedge against inflation. The yellow metal has been used as a store of wealth for thousands of years.\nUnlike fiat money, gold can\u2019t be created at will by central banks. So, its value isn't tied to any particular currency or economy, making it a stable asset during periods of economic instability and inflation.\nLast year, economist Peter Schiff told investors that the metal was underpriced due to persistent inflationary pressures.\n\u201cI think it has to be repriced higher to reflect the reality of much higher inflation. We\u2019re not going to go back to 2%, probably in my lifetime,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be much higher than that, and when investors come to terms with that, they\u2019re going to bid up the price of gold much higher.\u201d\nFast-forwarding to the present, the enthusiasm of investors has indeed propelled the price of gold to record levels. The precious metal has surged past the $2,500 per ounce mark, setting a new milestone.\nThese days, there are many ways to gain exposure to gold. You can own bullion, buy shares of gold mining companies or ETFs or even tap into potential tax advantages with a gold IRA.\nIn January 2024, the non-profit Oxfam reported that the world\u2019s billionaires have become $3.3 trillion wealthier than they were in 2020, with their wealth increasing at a rate three times faster than that of inflation.\nFor some of the most famous billionaires, a substantial portion of their wealth is linked to the companies they founded or currently manage. As inflation drives up costs, businesses that can successfully pass these costs onto consumers through higher prices can maintain or even grow their profit margins. This, in turn, can lead to increased earnings and potentially higher stock prices.\nThe Oxfam report highlighted how large firms were making oversized profits during inflationary times, noting, \u201c148 of the world\u2019s biggest corporations together raked in $1.8 trillion in total net profits in the year to June 2023, a 52% jump compared to average net profits in 2018-2021.\u201d\nWhile stocks are also volatile, the market has performed remarkably well during the recent inflationary period. The S&P 500, for instance, has seen a 90% increase over the last five years.\nOxfam also observed that share ownership \u201coverwhelmingly benefits the richest,\u201d with the top 1% owning 43% of all global financial assets.\nBut you don\u2019t have to be in the billionaires\u2019 club to access the stock market. These days, many platforms enable you to buy and sell stocks with minimal initial investment requirements. Some apps can even help you invest in index funds like the S&P 500 automatically using your spare change, making it easier than ever to grow your wealth alongside the world\u2019s financial elite.\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

Just over 60% of those surveyed see the greenback ultimately weakening in the event the Republican candidate secures another presidential term.\nHistory is on their side. A Bloomberg gauge of the dollar slid more than 10% while the spot price of gold rallied over 50% during Trump\u2019s four years in office.\nTrump\u2019s platform of tax cuts, tariffs and weaker regulation are viewed as inflationary on Wall Street and could even force the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates again. A red wave in November that ushers in Republican control of Congress, granting Trump greater leeway in enacting sweeping economic policies, could further ignite the precious metal as prices hover near all-time highs.\n\u201cGold sits in a prime position to rally,\u201d according to Gregory Shearer, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. Geopolitical tensions, the growing US deficit, reserve bank diversification and inflation hedging have all driven bullion prices higher, \u201cthese factors likely endure regardless of the election outcome but could be further magnified under a Trump 2.0 or \u2018red wave\u2019 scenario,\u201d he wrote July 24.\nA number of respondents to the MLIV Pulse survey seemed to agree: \u201cAll I can see are severe disruptions to markets and trade, and rapid increases\u201d in the US national debt, one said.\nBullion\u2019s gains during the Trump presidency were in part fueled by investors seeking safety as the Covid-19 pandemic hit and the federal funds rate fell to near zero. Gold \u2014 which pays no interest \u2014 reached what was back then a record high in August 2020 amid global lockdown jitters.\nIt wasn\u2019t even the biggest surge under a president we\u2019ve seen in the past fifty years \u2014 returns under George W. Bush and Jimmy Carter were far greater.\nThis time around, the macro backdrop is again favorable for bullion. The Fed is expected to start to cut interest rates in September. Central banks have been scooping up gold aggressively since 2022 in an effort to diversify away from the dollar.\nTwo-thirds of survey responders expect a Trump reelection to undermine the dollar\u2019s status as the world\u2019s reserve currency.\nKathryn Rooney Vera, chief market strategist at StoneX Group, says a Trump second term could exacerbate the move away from the greenback as the private sector joins central banks in the rotation.\n\u201cClient portfolios are adding gold holdings. There\u2019s a lot of expectations of a weaker dollar,\u201d she said. \u201cTechnical, structural and fundamental factors are all supportive of gold.\u201d\nBut, betting that the dollar will weaken under Trump is a contentious view as top economists on Wall Street see a second Trump term strengthening, not weakening, the currency. His bias for harsher tariffs on US trading partners and deficit-boosting fiscal policies could interrupt the Fed\u2019s anticipated interest-rate cuts, they said.\nMLIV Pulse respondents were divided over the impact Trump economic policies would have on the dollar. One respondent saw a weaker dollar no matter what the election outcome: \u201cSustained high deficits and lower interest rates will push further de-dollarization and begin a sovereign debt crisis. It\u2019ll be the same if Kamala Harris wins.\u201d\nThe dollar and US Treasuries are often viewed as global havens during times of geopolitical stress. But the survey responses indicate that the greenback may not be the beneficiary of homegrown political volatility.\n\u201cWhen the US is creating its own risk premium due to a potentially disorderly election, the fiscal implications of a Trump presidency, that makes the dollar in 2025 a risk,\u201d said Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB.\nThe MLIV Pulse survey was conducted from July 22 to July 26 among Bloomberg News terminal and online readers worldwide who chose to engage with the survey, and included portfolio managers, economists and retail investors. This week, the survey asks whether high interest rates in the US made you richer or poorer.

        "full_text": "We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best Stocks Under $10 To Invest In Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Hudbay Minerals Inc. (NYSE:HBM) stands against the other stocks under $10.\nInvesting in stocks priced under $10 can be an appealing strategy for investors looking for growth opportunities without a significant upfront investment. Such stocks, often referred to as penny stocks or small-cap stocks, can offer high returns but also come with greater risk and volatility compared to blue-chip stocks. However, when chosen carefully based on strong fundamentals, solid management, and positive market sentiment, these investments can yield substantial gains over the long term.\nAccording to BlackRock\u2019s Q4 2024 Equity Market Outlook, there are compelling reasons to consider small caps as part of a diversified portfolio. The firm's analysis highlights that while the economy continues to face uncertainty, this does not necessarily equate to poor stock performance. Market volatility can present investors with an opportunity to buy high-quality stocks at discounted prices, particularly when driven by sentiment rather than company fundamentals.\nFundstrat's Tom Lee is also bullish on small caps, we covered this in our article about the 10 Best Young Stocks To Buy Now, here's an excerpt from it:\n\"As for small-cap stocks represented by the Russell 2000 index, Lee acknowledged some profit-taking after a strong week but maintained that such fluctuations are typical during bottoming phases. He drew parallels to previous market recoveries, such as energy stocks in 2021, suggesting that while current movements may feel erratic, they signal a multi-year growth opportunity for small caps.\"\nThe past year has seen several \u201cmini rolling recessions,\u201d starting in sectors like technology and housing, as the global economy grapples with a post-pandemic recalibration. Yet, the stock market has shown resilience and adaptability, with many companies adjusting to what can be seen as a return to more stable economic conditions. Volatility, though unsettling, can be a favorable condition for seasoned investors who can spot value opportunities.\nIn the current environment, where the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy decisions and upcoming elections are expected to further influence volatility, it\u2019s essential for investors to look beyond temporary market disruptions and focus on the fundamentals of individual companies. Historically, the stock market has been a forward-looking mechanism that attempts to predict recessions with mixed success. Market volatility can present investors with an opportunity to buy high-quality stocks at discounted prices, particularly when driven by sentiment rather than company fundamentals.\nOne key takeaway is that large-cap stocks may present greater opportunities compared to both mega-caps and small-cap stocks. This perspective is based on observations from the third quarter when concerns over a slowing economy led to market turbulence. However, these concerns were largely rooted in sentiment rather than the actual financial health of most companies.\nMoreover, volatility can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it can trigger sell-offs due to investor fear or uncertainty, but on the other, it can provide strategic buying opportunities for fundamentally sound stocks trading at lower prices. Investors should consider adopting a selective approach during these periods, ensuring that they have a deep understanding of the companies in which they invest. This strategy can instill confidence and conviction when markets experience short-term volatility.\nHistorically, market corrections, defined as declines of 10% or more, are not uncommon. In fact, over the past 35 years, corrections have occurred in 20 years, with an average drawdown of 14%. Yet, during this period, the S&P 500 Index has delivered an average annual return of 11%. Investors who stay the course through these corrections have often been rewarded with strong returns as the market eventually rebounds.\nThe impact of Federal Reserve rate cuts on different stock categories is also an important consideration. Equity markets generally perform well when the Fed initiates rate cuts, particularly in the absence of a recession. Historical data shows that in the year following the first rate cut of a cycle, large-cap stocks tend to outperform small-cap stocks, with high-quality and low-beta stocks also being strong performers. This trend is observed two and three years after the start of a rate-cutting cycle, suggesting that investors might consider shifting focus to these segments as the Fed\u2019s monetary policy evolves.\nSector performance is another crucial area to explore. Sectors such as healthcare and consumer staples have historically outperformed in the year following the first rate cut of a cycle, driven by their defensive nature and consistent demand. Meanwhile, cyclical sectors like financials typically gain momentum as the cycle progresses and the economy enters a recovery phase.\nWhile every market cycle is unique, the healthcare sector is seen as a potential outperformer over the long term, supported by secular tailwinds such as an aging population and rising health needs. Furthermore, the technology sector, driven by innovation in artificial intelligence and cloud computing, is also poised for long-term growth despite recent setbacks. The integration of AI and machine learning into various industries has created new revenue streams, enhancing operational efficiency and profitability for companies involved.\nAs the stock market navigates these complexities, investors should maintain a balanced perspective and not shy away from exploring undervalued opportunities. Stocks under $10, while inherently riskier, can still provide substantial upside when identified through rigorous analysis and an understanding of industry trends. For example, some companies in sectors like renewable energy, biotechnology, and digital transformation have shown the potential to scale rapidly from a lower base, driven by strong business models and favorable macroeconomic factors.\nFurthermore, sectors that are less sensitive to economic downturns, such as utilities and essential consumer goods, also present interesting opportunities for investing in lower-priced stocks. These sectors tend to exhibit stable revenue streams, which can help cushion portfolios during periods of heightened market volatility. For investors with a higher risk tolerance, energy and tech stocks could offer substantial gains, especially as new innovations and infrastructure developments continue to take shape.\nUltimately, the key to successfully investing in lower-priced stocks lies in adopting a diversified approach, focusing on sectors that demonstrate long-term resilience and growth potential. By analyzing company fundamentals, industry position, and market sentiment, investors can better position themselves to capture opportunities that arise from market fluctuations.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we used the Finviz screener and identified 20 stocks with market capitalizations of over $2 billion, having Buy or better rating from analysts, with share prices under $10, as of September 27. Next, we examined Insider Monkey\u2019s data on 912 hedge funds as of Q2 2024. We narrowed down our list to 8 stocks most widely held by institutional investors and ranked them in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them as of Q2 of 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NYSE:HBM) is a diversified mining company that engages in the exploration, development, operation, and optimization of properties across North and South America. The company produces copper concentrates containing gold, silver, and molybdenum, as well as zinc, molybdenum concentrates, and silver/gold dor\u00e9. Hudbay Minerals Inc. (NYSE:HBM) flagship asset is the Constancia mine in southern Peru, while it also operates in Manitoba, Canada, and British Columbia. The company was founded in 1927 and is headquartered in Toronto, Canada.\nHudbay Minerals Inc. (NYSE:HBM) recent second-quarter 2024 financial results demonstrate a promising outlook for the stock despite missing on earnings expectations. The company reported a loss per share of $-0.04501, falling short of analysts' estimates of $0.06. However, Hudbay Minerals Inc. (NYSE:HBM) continues to show operational resilience and solid execution across its diverse asset portfolio.\nIn the second quarter, Hudbay Minerals Inc. (NYSE:HBM) achieved consolidated copper production of 29,000 tons and consolidated gold production of 59,000 ounces, aligning with its quarterly production targets for 2024. The company reaffirmed its full-year guidance, with copper production expected to be slightly below the midpoint of the range, while gold production is anticipated to surpass the midpoint, thanks to strong performance at the New Britannia Mill in Manitoba. This consistent production level, coupled with higher byproduct credits, allowed Hudbay Minerals Inc. (NYSE:HBM) to reduce its consolidated cash cost guidance to $0.90-$1.10 per pound of copper, down from the previous range of $1.05-$1.25.\nHudbay Minerals Inc. (NYSE:HBM) financial health has also seen significant improvement. The company generated $30 million in free cash flow during the quarter, maintaining its trend of positive cash flow generation. Over the last twelve months, Hudbay has produced nearly $400 million in free cash flow. Additionally, Hudbay\u2019s net debt reduced by over $550 million during the past year, and its net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio dropped to 0.8x from 2.9x a year ago. This deleveraging effort enhances its balance sheet flexibility, positioning the company to advance key growth initiatives.\nAs of Q2 2024, 38 hedge funds held positions in Hudbay Minerals Inc. (NYSE:HBM), up from 31 in the previous quarter, reflecting increased institutional interest. Given the company\u2019s strong asset base, cost management, and improving financial metrics, Hudbay Minerals Inc. remains a compelling investment under $10 per share.\nL1 Long Short Fund stated the following regarding Hudbay Minerals Inc. (NYSE:HBM) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cHudbay Minerals Inc. (NYSE:HBM) (Long +31%) shares rallied over the quarter driven by rising copper and gold prices, as well as strong production results. The company\u2019s first quarter results showed higher gold production and robust operating performance at both its major assets, which exceeded consensus expectations. In addition, the company announced a ~US$400m equity raise to support balance sheet de-leveraging and fund its key growth projects. Hudbay is a mid-tier mining company primarily producing copper, alongside gold and zinc, with its key assets located in Canada and Peru. We are attracted to Hudbay due to our positive medium-term outlook for copper and the company\u2019s strong near-term free cash flow generation. This cash generation potential will allow the company to de-lever and recycle capital back into its highly prospective exploration program and major growth projects, most notably its Copper World project in Arizona.\u201d\nOverall HBM ranks 5th on our list of the best stocks under $10 to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of HBM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Economic growth has cooled from the rapid pace of earlier quarters, but it is still a safe distance from stalling or contracting.\u201d\nStill, Ruscitti accepts that stocks are unlikely to resume climbing steadily from here until there is even more confidence in a soft-landing scenario. In addition, seasonal headwinds may make investors less willing to increase exposure to equities for now, while anxiety over geopolitical tension and the looming U.S. election may also weigh on sentiment.\n\u201cThese factors argue for keeping a tight leash on risk in the near run and being patient in deploying new capital into the equity market,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, aggressively selling stocks on the notion that Fed rate cuts are bad for risk assets is premature based on the weight of the economic evidence.\u201d\nThat said, here\u2019s a table showing how sectors performed over three months following the start of those seven rate-cutting cycles.\nMarkets\nU.S. stock-index futures ES00 YM00 NQ00 are lower as benchmark Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Ydip.

        "full_text": "Gold Stocks Are the Hidden Opportunity in 2024\u2019s Bull Market\nFrank Holmes\n5 min read\nOn Tuesday, gold hit a new all-time high of $2,670 an ounce, continuing a remarkable rally that\u2019s seen the precious metal gain over 27% since the start of the year. If 2024 ended today, it would mark the best year for gold since 2010, when the asset finished up nearly 30%.\nDespite the momentum, many investors still aren\u2019t paying attention to what I consider to be one of the most obvious opportunities in the market today: gold stocks.\nSome investors might be hesitant to buy into gold at these prices, but I believe there are several factors that suggest the rally still has room to run. Central banks around the world are entering a new phase of monetary easing, and investors\u2014Western retail investors in particular\u2014are finally starting to recognize gold\u2019s value as a hedge against inflation and global uncertainty.\nThe real opportunity may not be in physical gold itself or the ETFs tracking it, though; instead, I believe it\u2019s in the deeply undervalued gold mining stocks that have yet to catch up to the price of bullion.\nLow Rates Push Investors to Consider Gold for Portfolio Diversification\nAt the heart of this gold rally is the Federal Reserve\u2019s recent policy shift. The Fed made a decisive 50-basis-point (bp) rate cut last week, lowering the opportunity cost of holding a non-yielding asset like gold.\nAnd this could be just the beginning. Analysts and market watchers expect another 50bps of easing this year, followed by an additional 100bps in 2025. This aggressive easing cycle should further increase the appeal of gold as a store of value.\nThe reason for this is that, when interest rates are low, investors have historically tended to move away from traditional fixed-income assets like bonds, which offer lower returns. As a result, they\u2019ve looked for alternative investments, and gold has long been one of the most popular hedges against inflation and financial instability.\nRecord Central Bank Gold Purchases Fuel the Rally\nIt\u2019s not just investors driving gold\u2019s rise. Central banks are playing a massive role. In recent years, these institutions have significantly increased their gold reserves, and their buying spree shows no signs of slowing down. Central bank purchases now account for about a quarter of total global gold demand, which is double what it was before 2022. Gold-buying reached a new record high of 483 tonnes in the first half of the year, a 5% increase over the same period in 2023, according to the World Gold Council (WGC).\nDespite this backdrop, many Western retail investors have been slow to embrace gold this cycles. According to a recent Bank of America study, 71% of U.S. financial advisors have little to no gold allocation, often representing less than 1% of their portfolios.\nHowever, that narrative is changing. With the Fed\u2019s rate cuts finally materializing, investors are starting to return to gold-backed ETFs once again. The WGC reported positive fund flows into North American gold bullion ETFs during July and August, with European products seeing similar momentum since May. For the first time since 2022, the 50-day moving average for gold holdings has crossed above its 200-day moving average, a bullish signal known as the \u201cgolden cross.\u201d This is a sign that the gold rally could be starting to gain serious traction among investors.\nGold Mining Stocks Remain Undervalued Despite Rising Metal Prices\nWhile the spotlight has been on gold prices and ETFs, gold mining stocks remain highly undervalued by comparison. Over the past couple of years, shares of gold mining companies have underperformed relative to gold itself, primarily due to rising costs and a general lack of interest. In 2022 and 2023, a sharp rise in the all-in sustaining cost (AISC), a measure of the cost to produce one ounce of gold, weighed heavily on mining stocks, which in turn led to many investors losing confidence in the sector.\nBut here\u2019s the thing: The underperformance of gold mining stocks relative to the underlying metal has created what I consider to be an incredible opportunity. Right now, these stocks are trading at levels that don\u2019t reflect the continued rise in gold prices. And since gold mining stocks have typically moved out of lockstep with the broader market, they offer a level of diversification that I believe can help hedge portfolios against market downturns.\nIt\u2019s not just me saying this. Some of the most well-known contrarian investors are taking note. Stanley Druckenmiller, for example, made headlines when he sold off big tech stocks like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) in late 2023 and started buying into gold miners like Newmont Goldcorp Corp (NYSE:NEM) and Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD).\nUSERX Beating Its Benchmark Amid Gold\u2019s Strong Performance\nAt U.S. Global Investors, we\u2019ve always been firm believers in the potential of gold and gold mining stocks, and our U.s. Global Investors Gold And Precious Metals Fund is a reflection of that belief. As the first no-load gold fund in the U.S., USERX has a rich history of delivering value to investors through active management and a deep understanding of the mining sector.\nOur investment strategy focuses on producers\u2014companies that are currently pulling gold and other precious minerals out of the ground. These \u201csenior\u201d producers often have the largest market caps in the sector and are well-positioned to benefit from the ongoing rise in gold prices. Under normal market conditions, USERX invests at least 80% of its net assets in such securities.\nYear-to-date, USERX is modestly beating its benchmark, the FTSE Gold Mines Index, thanks to our team\u2019s decades of experience in both geology and mining finance. We understand the technical side of the business, and that expertise allows us to make informed investment decisions that benefit our shareholders. As gold continues its rally and central banks embark on a new easing cycle, I believe USERX is well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunities ahead.\nWhile gold is hitting new highs, the real story could be in the undervalued gold mining stocks that many investors have overlooked. With USERX, you can tap into this potential while benefiting from the expertise of a management team that has been involved in the gold market for decades.",

For lower-quality and smaller diamonds, prices plunged to their lowest levels in about 10 years, according to Paul Zimnisky, a leading diamond analyst.\nBut diamond prices have begun to tick higher in recent months. The International Diamond Exchange's Diamond Index climbed past a level of 110 in January, snapping a steep decline that lasted nearly all of the past two years.\nIDEX Diamond Index over the last three-month period\nCormac Kinney, the CEO of the commodities trading firm Diamond Standard, told Business Insider he sees even better days ahead for the diamond trade. He and Zimnisky predict prices could climb another 5%-10% this year.\nBut over the next 20 years, that growth could scale, resulting in a boon for diamond investors. Kinney's firm expects diamond prices to skyrocket over the next few decades, though he didn't have an exact price target.\nThere's a major disturbance in the force,\" Kinney said of the price movement.\nJewelers on the mend\nThe upswing in diamond prices will be fueled by several factors, Zimnisky and Kinney said.\nFor one, the supply of available diamonds will become even tighter this year. That's a reversal from 2023, when diamond producers, who shuttered mining activity during the pandemic, ended up overproducing diamonds, causing prices to tumble.\nEfforts are already underway to tighten supply, Zimnisky said, with some suppliers halting mining activity altogether. The Russian mining giant Alrosa, for instance, paused sales of rough diamonds for two months last year to boost prices.\nTighter supply will be exacerbated by the G7's recent ban on Russian diamonds, Kinney added, as Russia is no longer be able to pass off its diamonds off to Chinese and Indian refiners, who can then sell them to the West. That could slash another 30% of the world's diamond supply off the market, he estimated.\n\"We'll begin to see inventory levels normalize. And once that happens, we'll start to see natural diamond prices recover,\" Zimnisky said.",

Plant throughput will grow from the current 27Mt to 52Mt, doubling the mine\u2019s annual copper production from 120kt to a life-of-mine average of 240kt per annum3. The process expansion is supported by a ramp up of total mining volumes, which are planned to increase incrementally year-on-year, from 150Mt in 2024 to approximately 240Mt in 2028 and then to an average rate of 290Mt per annum from 2030 onwards1,4.\nChief Operating Officer for Africa and Middle East Sebastiaan Bock said: \u201cThe phased ramp-up will enable a competitive cost profile over the life of the mine and annual operating cash flow and free cash flow5 are projected to improve by as much as 85% and 60%, respectively, based on the long-term copper price consensus. These production and cost improvements will contribute to an estimated incremental net present value (NPV8) of $1.7 billion1.\u201d\nAt a flat long term average copper price consensus of $4.13/lb, Barrick estimates that the project will deliver an incremental IRR (Internal Rate of Return) of 20%6 and a total mine IRR of more than 50%6, paying back the initial expansion capital in approximately two years after completion of the expansion. Post-expansion, cost of sales and C1 cash costs7 are estimated at approximately $2.36/lb and $1.85/lb, respectively, placing Lumwana in the first quartile of the industry, excluding the benefit of any byproducts.\nAccording to Mineral Resource Management and Evaluation Executive Simon Bottoms, the process plant engineering has matured to a point that has allowed Barrick to select major equipment vendors and place orders for long lead equipment, including both mills and crushers. \u201cWe are starting detailed engineering works this quarter and expanding our onsite accommodation while building partnerships with key suppliers and contractors ahead of the pre-construction ground preparation works, which are scheduled to start next year,\u201d said Bottoms.\nCommissioning of the new process plant is planned to start in the second half of 2027. Once the new process circuit is commissioned, the existing circuit will undergo a series of planned shutdowns, allowing Barrick to install upgrades, while ensuring uninterrupted copper delivery throughout the expansion.\nThe permitting process for the expansion is well underway, with the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment already submitted to the Zambian authorities and approval expected by the end of this year.\nBarrick enquiries\nInvestor and media relations Kathy du Plessis +44 20 7557 7738 Email: barrick@dpapr.com\nTechnical Information The scientific and technical information contained in this press release has been reviewed and approved by Richard Peattie, MPhil, FAusIMM, Mineral Resources Manager: Africa and Middle East; Simon Bottoms, CGeol, MGeol, FGS, FAusIMM, Mineral Resource Management and Evaluation Executive; John Steele, CIM, Metallurgy, Engineering and Capital Projects Executive; and Joel Holliday, FAusIMM, Executive Vice-President, Exploration\u2014each a \u201cQualified Person\u201d as defined in National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects.\nEndnotes\n1\nFinancial metrics and production metrics are based upon Barrick's internal pre-feasibility study which is conceptual in nature because it includes mineral resources that are not yet categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the pre-feasibility assessment will be realized. These metrics are subject to change upon completion of the feasibility study. The assumptions outlined within the pre-feasibility study assessment have formed the basis for the ongoing study and were made by a Qualified Person. The Qualified Person will evaluate the results of the completed feasibility study before determining whether all or a part of the mineral resource for the Super Pit Expansion Project may be converted to a mineral reserve.\n2\nA Tier One Copper Asset is an asset with a $3.00/lb reserve with potential for 5 million tonnes or more of contained copper to support a minimum 20-year life, annual production of at least 200ktpa, with all-in sustaining costs per pound in the lower half of the industry cost curve. Tier One Assets must be located in a world class geological district with potential for organic reserve growth and long-term geologically driven addition.\n3\nLife of Mine Plan mined tonnes, grade and ounces and financials are based on the pre-feasibility study but are conceptual in nature due to using mineral resources and are subject to change with completion of the feasibility study which is anticipated for Q4 2024.\n4\nThe results in this press release represent forward-looking information and are based on Barrick\u2019s internal pre-feasibility study for the Super Pit. These results are based on mineral resources only and depend on inputs that are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those presented here. Barrick is in the process of completing a feasibility study in respect of the Super Pit, the results of which may differ from the figures disclosed in this press release. Barrick does not currently identify Lumwana as a material property. Barrick expects to re-evaluate Lumwana\u2019s status as a potential material property following the completion of the feasibility study for the Super Pit Expansion Project and the preparation of updated mineral reserves and resources estimates for Lumwana as of December 31, 2024. A Technical Report will be prepared in accordance with Form 43-101F1 and filed on SEDAR+ within 45 days of the disclosure of the results of the feasibility study if Lumwana is classified as a material property.\n5\n\u201cFree cash flow\u201d is a non-GAAP financial performance measure which deducts capital expenditures from net cash provided by operating activities.

UnitedHealth (UNH) shares added about 5% after the healthcare group beat quarterly profit estimates, even as it said it expects to take a $1.6 billion hit from a February cyberattack.\nInvestors were also digesting more big bank results: Bank of America (BAC) reported that first quarter profit dropped 18% year over year as a key revenue source weakened, while Morgan Stanley (MS) stock rose as it topped expectations. Elsewhere, BNY Mellon (BK) posted a profit beat while Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) reported a revenue miss.\nLIVE COVERAGE IS OVER 16 updates- Allie Canal\nUnited Airlines jumps after reporting narrower loss, strong guidance\nShares of United Airlines (UAL) jumped more than 5% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the airliner posted first-quarter results that beat Wall Street expectations.\nUAL posted an adjusted loss of $0.15 a share compared to the $0.57 loss analysts compiled by Bloomberg had expected. Operating revenue of $12.54 billion also beat estimates of $12.44 billion.\nThe company guided to stronger-than-expected earnings for the current quarter, forecasting adjusted EPS of $3.75 to $4.25, topping expectations of $3.73.\nNotably, United posted a net loss of $124 million in the first quarter following the three-week grounding of all Boeing 737 Max 9s after a door plug blew off an Alaska Airlines Max jetliner earlier this year.

Friday and Monday\u2019s market action brought the largest two day-decline in the S&P 500, 2.6%, in more than year.\nTruist Co-CIO Keith Lerner pointed out in a note to clients on Monday night that the pullback seen recently in the market is to be expected in any given year.\n\u201cPeriodic pullbacks are the admission price to the market,\u201d Lerner wrote.\nThe S&P 500's 4% intra-year fall in 2024 is still a far cry from the average 14% drawdown seen over the last forty years, per Lerner's analysis. And given this, the market's current direction could get worse before it gets better.\n\u201cOur view remains that the primary stock market trend remains positive,\u201d Lerner wrote. \u201cWe continue to expect a bumpier path forward relative to the abnormally-smooth first quarter ride.\u201d\n- Dani Romero\n'Interest rate volatility' could hit homebuilder forecasts this earnings season: UBS\nUncertainty over when the Fed will raise interest rates could hit homebuilders' outlooks in the upcoming earnings season, according to UBS analysts.\n\u201cWe expect solid 1Q homebuilder financial results, with upbeat industry demand commentary from management teams, consistent with Lennar (LEN) and KB Home (KBH),\u201d John Lovallo, UBS analyst, wrote in a note to clients Tuesday morning. But he noted that \"interest rate volatility/uncertainty remains heightened, exacerbated by last week's CPI, which could result in conservative homebuilder gross margin outlooks.\"\nBuilders have been offering incentives like mortgage rate buydowns to sell homes in the high interest rate environment. Such deal sweeteners while effective hurt profit margins.\nThe 30-year fixed mortgage rate has been hovering around 7% in recent weeks, a far cry from the below-5% rates that many homeowners are locked into already. That has kept more buyers and sellers on the sidelines.\nThe prospect of the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate cut looks murkier following recent higher than expected inflation prints, a factor likely to pressure builder stocks near term.\nAs a result, UBS has been \u201c more cautious than consensus on '24/'25 homebuilding gross margins, although Street forecasts seem to have moderated to some extent,\u201d Lovallo noted.\nDR Horton (DHI), the largest builder by market cap, is expected to report earnings before the market opens on Thursday.\n- Allie Canal\nPowell: Will take 'longer than expected' to reach confidence on inflation\nFederal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday it will likely take \"longer than expected\" for the central bank to be confident in its inflation fight, citing a \"lack of further progress\" this year when it comes to bringing inflation back down to the Fed's 2% target.\nPowell, who noted the US economy over the past year has been \"quite strong,\" pointed to hotter-than-expected inflation data over the past three months.\n\u201cThe recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence and instead indicate that it\u2019s likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence,\" he said during a fireside chat with Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem in DC.\nThe central bank leader suggested a higher-for-longer policy stance is here to stay, adding, \"We can maintain the current level of restriction for as long as needed.\"\nYields jumped on the heels of his comments with the 2-year note briefly touching above 5% \u2014 its highest level since November. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX), which touched 2024 highs on Monday, climbed about 6 basis points to trade around 4.69%.\nIn equities, the benchmark S&P 500 reversed earlier gains while the Dow held positive.\n- Allie Canal\nIt's time to start paying attention to the Vix\nHigher for longer interest rate angst, coupled with greater geopolitical risks, are beginning to show up in markets.\nThe Cboe Volatility Index (^VIX), otherwise known as Wall Street's \"fear gauge,\" closed above 19 for the first time since Halloween on Monday. The index continued to hover at those levels on Tuesday.\nCiti's equity strategist Stuart Kaiser said the moves point to \"localized signs of stress\" in the market as rising yields continue to pressure stocks while investors also digest escalating tensions in the Middle East.\nFundstrat head of research Tom Lee said the surging Vix means investors don't believe the worst is priced into stocks and to be extra cautious when buying any dip.\n\"Investors are de-risking,\" he said in a video to subscribers uploaded early Tuesday. \"We're in the danger part but it does increase opportunity. Ultimately, the Vix says to move slow here. Maybe extra slowly.\"\n- Brian Sozzi\nThe gold calls continue on the Street\nCiti is out today with a $3,000 an ounce gold call, which could very well fuel more sales of gold bars at Costco (COST)!\nDeutsche Bank is being slightly more measured today, forecasting $2,400 an ounce for gold by year end and $2,600 an ounce by December 2025. Gold prices currently stand around $2,400 an ounce.\nA couple things from their note that caught my attention:\nOn potential buying if gold prices pullback: \"We think gold is likely to remain on a strong footing as any profit-taking by early investors would be replaced by investment from those who have so far not participated in the move, but agree philosophically with its direction.\"\nOn the Fed's influence on gold: \"From an inflation and monetary policy standpoint, gold's strength stems from the ability to 'have it both ways' whereby inflation remains a significant concern, but at the same time, the FOMC judges rates as sufficiently restrictive and, hence, the next move (however much delayed) remains a cut.\"\n- Allie Canal\nDow edges higher\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) edged higher in afternoon trading on Tuesday, up about 0.5%, as the index looked to snap a six-day losing streak.\nBoth the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) reversed earlier losses to trade mostly flat.\nMeanwhile, bond yields remain at multi-month highs, with the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) climbing about 4 basis points to trade around 4.66%.\n- Allie Canal\nTrump Media stock tanks... again\nTrump Media & Technology Group (DJT), the parent company of Donald Trump's social media platform Truth Social, fell about 12% on Tuesday after the company announced it's launching a new live TV streaming platform.\nAccording to a press release, Trump Media will launch the live streaming service on phones, tablets, and TV through the Truth Social app.\n\"The streaming content is expected to focus on live TV including news networks, religious channels, family-friendly content including films and documentaries; and other content that has been cancelled, is at risk of cancellation, or is being suppressed on other platforms and services,\" according to the release.\nTrump Media went public on the Nasdaq after merging with special purpose acquisition company Digital World Acquisition Corp. in a deal approved by shareholders late last month. Shares are down more than 60% since the end of March.\nOn Monday, the stock tumbled on news the company had filed to issue more than 21 million shares.\nTrump maintains a roughly 60% stake in Truth Social. At current trading levels of about $23.40 a share, Trump Media boasts a market cap of roughly $3.2 billion, giving the former president a stake worth around $1.9 billion. Right after the company's public debut, Trump's stake was worth just over $4.5 billion.\n- Allie Canal\nStocks extend declines, reverse earlier gains\nStocks extended declines in mid-morning trading on Tuesday after markets initially eyed a broader comeback earlier in the session.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hugged the flatline after coming off a six-session run of losses. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) dropped about 0.3% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell roughly 0.2%.\nThe moves come as bond yields remain at multi-month highs, coupled with rising tensions in the Middle East following Iran's weekend attacks on Israel.\n- Dani Romero\nNew data shows market for new homes 'starting to show cracks'\nNew residential construction, including single-family and multifamily homes, tumbled by the largest amount in four years as rising mortgage rates weaken housing activity.\nHousing starts fell 14.7% month over month in March, dropping from a 1.55 million units annualized pace to 1.32 million units annualized, according to data from the Census Bureau released Tuesday. Single-family starts fell 12.4% month over month.\nAccording to LPL Financial\u2019s chief economist, Jeffrey Roach, the data indicates how new home construction is \"starting to show cracks in the pace of growth.\"\n\u201cHousing construction is poised to slow as potential homebuyers indicate now is a poor time to buy a home. Investors should expect residential investment becoming a drag on GDP growth in the coming quarters. Housing activity may not fully stabilize until the Fed commences their easing cycle.\"\nThe fresh government data comes after builder sentiment in April was flat from the previous month, breaking four consecutive months of gains. The NAHB said, \u201cBuyers are hesitating until they can better gauge where interest rates are headed.\u201d\n\u201cLooking ahead, we still think single-family starts stand to benefit from the lack of second-hand homes on the market, shifting demand to newbuilds,\" Thomas Ryan, property economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note to clients following the release.\n\"But that strength will be offset by weakness in multi-family starts, which we expect will remain around current levels, leaving total housing starts little higher than they currently are by the end of this year.\"\nThe SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) was trading lower by more than 1% Tuesday morning.\n- Allie Canal\nLive Nation falls on antitrust probe report\nShares of Live Nation (LYV), the parent company of Ticketmaster, fell about 7% early Tuesday after the Wall Street Journal reported the Department of Justice (DOJ) is preparing to file an antitrust lawsuit against the company as soon as next month.\nAccording to the report, the DOJ will allege that Live Nation has leveraged its dominance in the marketplace to harm competitors. The specific claims the department could allege are unknown at this time.\nThe federal government approved the Live Nation-Ticketmaster merger in 2010. Since then, the company has been at the center of antitrust concerns, with critics taking aim at its sky-high ticket fees and accusing the entertainment giant of monopolistic practices and anti-competitive behavior.\nIn 2020, the department updated the company's consent decree, an agreement that barred Live Nation from strong-arming venues into using TicketMaster for its tours, and extended it until 2025 after finding evidence the company repeatedly and over the course of several years engaged in conduct that violated its earlier agreement.\nIn the face of Tuesday's stock declines, shares are down about 1% since the start of the year.\n- Allie Canal\nStocks eye comeback\nThe Dow rose about 200 points on Tuesday as markets eyed a broader comeback to snap a six-day losing streak.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) climbed around 0.6% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) hugged the flatline. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped roughly 0.1%.\nBond yields continued to rise after the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) touched 2024 highs on Monday. The yield was up about 4 basis points to trade at around 4.66% early Tuesday.\n- Brian Sozzi\nChatting interest rates and markets with BNY Mellon\u2019s CEO\nI just had a good post-earnings chat with BNY Mellon (BK) CEO Robin Vince. BNY Mellon reported its quarterly results this morning, and the stock is up 2% premarket.\nI appreciated his thoughts on rates and markets (below), and I took them as inflationary!\n\u201cAs I think about the path of interest rates, there are a few things that are going on in the world. Clearly, we've got geopolitical risks that are out there, and just today, the potential escalation of the ongoing [Israel/Iran] conflict \u2014 that's certainly a risk. We've got consistently, relatively high inflation in the US and that's clearly a bit of a risk. So that brings into some question the path of interest rates. We've got fiscal challenges in the US and the continued [high] amount of issuance of US Treasurys from a volumes point of view. That can be quite good for our business, but as a citizen and a taxpayer, you have to worry a little bit about the path of debt sustainability in the United States. So there's a lot going on.\n\u201cNow, I'll give you the flip side as well because what we see is really strong, underlying underpinnings for the US economy, and it's not to say that we won't have a correction at some point in the stock market \u2014 that could well happen. It's not to say we couldn't have a recession at some point. That's kind of inevitable at some point in time. But when you look at the advantages that the US has right now, it's got a lot of significant advantages on a relative basis in the world. It's a great destination for investment. You can hear that from CEOs internationally. You can see it from investors putting their money into the United States, you can see the performance of the stock market, and there are a lot of tailwinds that are coming into the markets right now. So I would say it's a place you have to be prepared for all eventualities. Could we see the Fed stay on hold, maybe. Could we see the Fed cut rates this year? Probably. Could we see the Fed hike rates? Not impossible. You got to be prepared, but at the same time, the underlying direction of travel for the US is pretty positive.\u201d\n- Brian Sozzi\nBring on those Starbucks earnings\nStarbucks (SBUX) earnings will be out in a few weeks, and I have consumed note upon note suggesting the report could be ugly.\nMost of the concern on Starbucks at the moment stems from falling store traffic in the US, in part because prices for what Starbucks sells have gone through the roof. I paid $7 for a venti cold brew at a NYC store a week ago! (I have been cutting back trips to Starbucks.)\nBernstein is out this morning with a fresh look at store traffic, and it isn't pretty.\nStarbucks shares year to date: -11.3%.\n- Brian Sozzi\nMarkets quote of the morning....\nStock futures have been all over the map this morning after Monday's hot retail sales report drove a drubbing.\nThe indecision on the part of investors comes as they are still clinging to hopes of a June interest rate cut, which seems unlikely given how the macro data has trended in April.\nI think JPMorgan's strategy team offers up a good blunt take on markets this morning as if to level-set investors:\n\"For a market reliant on immaculate disinflation, a dovish Fed reaction function, and diminishing tail risks on growth, the continuation of hot growth and inflation data can bring us to a tipping point where a tighter stock vee bond risk premium finally produces a market correction. Inflation risks are also compounded by upside risks to oil due to geopolitical developments related to Russia and risk of further escalation in the Middle East. Additionally, investor positioning is elevated, with cash allocations at historical lows.\"",

He emphasized that his company and its shareholders feel a responsibility to contribute to the country's economy, particularly because the U.S. system has provided many opportunities and advantages.\n\"We always hope at Berkshire to pay substantial federal income taxes,\" Buffett said, adding that he feels it's appropriate for the company to contribute this way.\nBuffett also discussed the broader implications of tax rates and government spending. Currently, Berkshire pays a 21% federal tax rate on its earnings from investments like Apple stock.

Buffett highlighted the impact large corporations could have on the tax base and expressed his long-standing belief in the importance of businesses fulfilling their tax responsibilities.",

Organic path to +100 thousand (\"k\") ounces (\"oz\") in annual gold production with the potential to apply the direct ship ore (\"DSO\") model used at Manh Choh to both HighGold's Johnson Tract Project and Contango's Lucky Shot Project.\nAddition of a third high-quality deposit with long term upside potential - Immediately increases Contango's current resources threefold by adding +1 million (\"M\") oz of gold equivalent (\"AuEq\") @ approximately 9.4 grams per tonne (\"g/t\") AuEq4. Further exploration potential along the Johnson Tract Project's highly prospective 7.5-mile mineralized trend.\nManagement of Contango is ideally positioned to unlock value at Johnson Tract - Consistent with the development of Manh Choh, which is on schedule and on budget, Contango expects to unlock value from the Johnson Tract Project without the burden of large upfront capital requirements. The Johnson Tract Project's strategic seaside location expands opportunities for applying the DSO model.\nFinancial flexibility to fund growth through existing balance sheet capacity and near-term cash flow - Contango has the ability to progress the Johnson Tract Project with enhanced financial capacity underpinned by organic cash flow to be generated at Manh Choh and a track-record of successful project development and execution in Alaska.\nPartnerships with Cook Inlet Region, Inc. (\"CIRI\") and the Alaska Native Tetlin Tribe (\"Tetlin Tribe\") - HighGold has a lease agreement with CIRI, a regional corporation established by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971, authorizing the exploration and development of the Johnson Tract Project while Contango, through its joint venture with Kinross, has an existing partnership with the Tetlin Tribe authorizing mining and exploration activities at Manh Choh.\nCompelling re-rate potential - Re-rating to be driven by multiple near-term catalysts, led by achieving commercial production at Manh Choh, and an enhanced combined capital markets profile.\nRick Van Nieuwenhuyse, President and CEO of Contango, said, \"Darwin Green and his team have done an excellent job adding value to the Johnson Tract Project in a very tough market. The combination of HighGold and Contango makes a tremendous amount of strategic sense for both sets of shareholders - it is a true win-win for all. With the cash flow expected in the second half of 2024 from our high grade Manh Choh operation achieving commercial production, we will be able to continue to create value for the Johnson Tract Project and advance this high-quality project through to production. When combined with our Manh Choh and Lucky Shot projects, the Johnson Tract Project represents another asset that meets our criteria to be a run-of-mine, direct shipping ore operation. Contango will now develop a growth plan to advance these three assets to a production decision and target producing well in excess of 150,000 ounces of gold per year.\"\n\"We believe that a model of focusing on assets that meet three specific criteria: 1) located near existing or amenable to new infrastructure; 2) sufficient grade to directly transport run-of-mine ore to an existing third party processing facility; and 3) inclusive of a simple ore body - specifically in terms of permitting; will enable Contango to continue to build a significant production profile while minimizing our environmental footprint. As demonstrated, this business model would result in low permitting and execution risk, low initial capital outlay and shorter timelines to production. This model has worked well for Manh Choh and we believe it will work well for the Lucky Shot and Johnson Tract projects.\"\n\"We look forward to working closely with CIRI to rapidly advance the Johnson Tract Project to a production decision. In addition to the three projects discussed, Contango has assembled an impressive group of exploration stage properties in Alaska including: the 675,000 acres of highly prospective ground in the Tintina Gold belt and under lease from the Tetlin Alaska Native Tribe by our Peak Gold JV partner Kinross; our early stage assets (Eagle-Hona, Triple Z, and Shamrock); most of the Willow district surrounding the Lucky Shot Project; and now a large tract of private land owned by CIRI, a very successful Alaska Native Corporation based in Anchorage, Alaska.\"\nDarwin Green, President and CEO of HighGold said, \"HighGold believes this transaction with Contango represents a compelling value creating opportunity for our shareholders, with obvious synergies, an enhanced capital markets profile, financial strength, and a robust platform for future growth. It is a union that brings together three of Alaska's most compelling high-grade gold deposits in one company with ability to self-fund growth out of cash-flow.\"\n\"Contango's unique business model sets it apart in the mining sector. Focusing on assets with potential for DSO development, in which mineralized material is shipped to an existing off-site facility for processing mitigates much of the risk of conventional stand-alone mines. Advantages of the DSO model include lower capital costs, lower execution risk, lower environmental impact, and potential for significantly shorter timelines to achieve production. Contango's management has a strong track record of achievement in Alaska, most recently with their near-production Manh Choh project, in partnership with Kinross, which was permitted and built in 2.5 years. With Contango's experience, financial capabilities, and projected robust cash flow we are confident in their ability to propel the Johnson Tract Project forward. We extend our gratitude to our shareholders, stakeholders and the entire HighGold team for their dedicated efforts and support. We look forward to joining with Contango as it enters production and moves forward with the leading development pipeline in Alaska.\"\nBENEFITS TO CONTANGO SHAREHOLDERS\nThe Johnson Tract Project is a high-grade +1 M oz AuEq polymetallic deposit (grade of approximately 9.4 g/t AuEq) with an opportunity for near term production and excellent exploration potential.\nStrengthens Contango's the core portfolio and positions it to continue executing its strategy of building Alaska's next gold mines and growing annual gold production to +150 k oz Au.\nSignificant potential to unlock value by leveraging Contango's expertise, resources and projected cash flow to accelerate the development of the Johnson Tract Project.\nOpportunity to execute Contango's proven low-risk development strategy using its DSO platform. Contango has developed Manh Choh on schedule and on budget with production expected in the second half of 2024.\nHighly accretive to Contango on an in-situ basis with HighGold's ounces being acquired at ~US$30/oz AuEq with potential for a re-rating within Contango's portfolio as Manh Choh achieves commercial production.\nExpanded platform for Contango to continue its growth strategy in Alaska and elsewhere in the US and Canada.\nBENEFITS TO HIGHGOLD SHAREHOLDERS\nSignificant upfront premium of approximately 59% and 79% based on both companies' respective 20-day and 5-day VWAP.\nEarly participation in an emerging growth-focused gold mining company with a mission to become a low-risk multi-asset producer.\nElevated capital markets profile, improved trading liquidity and NYSE American listing and inclusion in the Russell 2000 index.\nAbility for Contango to progress the Johnson Tract Project with enhanced financial capacity, supported by projected organic cash flow and the teams impressive project development track-record in Alaska.\nManh Choh projected to generate US$54 million per year in free cash flow at a gold price of $1,920/oz (based on Contango's 30% interest).\nNear-term re-rating potential once transitioned into a producer, with first gold pour from Manh Choh expected in the second half of 2024.\nPotential to apply DSO model successfully utilized at Manh Choh to both the Johnson Tract Project and Contango's Lucky Shot Project.\nContinued exposure to exploration upside with lower execution and funding risk.\nTRANSACTION STRUCTURE AND TERMS\nThe Transaction will be carried out by way of court-approved Plan of Arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) and will require approval by 66 2/3% of the votes cast by HighGold shareholders and option holders, and 66 2/3% of votes cast by HighGold shareholders and option holders, voting together as a single class at a special meeting (the \"Meeting\") expected to be held in late [June] 2024. Directors and officers of HighGold, representing an aggregate of approximately 1.9% of the issued and outstanding HighGold Shares, have entered into voting support agreements pursuant to which, among other things, each director and officer has agreed to vote in favor of the Transaction at the Meeting.\nIn addition to HighGold securityholder approval, the Transaction is subject to other applicable regulatory approvals and closing conditions which are customary for a transaction of this nature.

Christopher Mancini, who co-manages Gabelli Gold Fund says \u201cThe Chinese central bank saw that happened and said \u2018We don\u2019t want that to happen to us.\u2019 It would make sense for them to want to significantly retire their [U.S.] dollar reserves. With gold, they don\u2019t have to worry about being repaid. We know they have been buying a consistent amount of gold every day.\u201d\nBernard Dahdah from Natixis suggests central banks might continue buying gold due to tensions between the US and China, potentially making prices above $2,300 the new norm. The move to gold also reflects a broader trend of nations reducing their reliance on the U.S. dollar, prompted by the dollar's use as a geopolitical tool against Russia, leading to gold prices reaching an all-time high of $2,480 per ounce on July 17, 2024. In U.S. the Fed is expected to cut the Fed funds rate, but inflation may remain steady, leading to lower real interest rates. This scenario benefits gold as the opportunity cost of holding non-interest-bearing gold decreases compared to cash and bonds. Additionally, a decline in U.S. real interest rates may weaken the U.S. dollar, making gold, which is globally priced in dollars, more attractive.\nOwning gold directly provides a \"store of value\" but offers limited returns rather than generate substantial gains like equities. However, other than its appeal in its ability to preserve value, many investors view it as a hedge against economic troubles rather than a high-return investment. So an investor otherwise seeking gold as a soaring investment would be disappointed in the longer term as it doesn\u2019t appreciate by much as gold has risen less than 300% in a century with annualized real returns of 1.34%, adjusted for inflation. Therefore investors looking for a more aggressive approach, aim for gold mining stocks that provide leverage to the gold price that yields returns surpassing those of the underlying commodity.\nDespite this leverage, the underlying stock valuations will consider future cash flows and market volatility of the gold as well as the consensus price estimates by market participants. Nonetheless, gold miner stocks should be more volatile than gold itself, offering greater returns if the investor's thesis on rising gold prices is correct.\nRegardless of gold prices rising over the last 15 years, gold mining ETFs and major miners (Agnico, Newmont, Barrick) have underperformed compared to physical gold. Although some companies covered in this article have succeeded, the gold mining sector requires careful scrutiny beyond just reserves and production. Like any other investment that is carefully analyzed mining companies need to be analysed based on management, capital allocation, and geopolitical risk. It is also because of these factors that gold mining companies are unable to reach their potential as viable investments.\nMethodology\nTo curate our list of 10 Best Gold Mining Companies to Invest in, we gathered a list of all companies using the holdings of gold miners ETFs. We then further narrowed down on the basis of their upside potential. With this let\u2019s now jump to our list of the 10 Best Gold Mining Companies to Invest in.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

But at 88 basis points they remain close to the most recent Fed projections for some 75bps of cuts this year and the first move is still not fully priced until July.\nGiven that, Powell may not want to rock the boat too much - although he could nod to the risks associated with a re-acceleration of the economy or even warn on recent stock market \"exuberance\" in the long question-and-answer session that follows his speech on Capitol Hill.\nA possible rise in long run \"neutral\" interest rate assumptions, the pace of the Fed's balance sheet rundown and election year policy questions may also come in the exchanges.\nBut, almost as if they were expecting a slap on the wrist, pricey U.S. megacap stocks tumbled on Tuesday ahead of the event - with a variety of reasons cited, from economic and political risks in China to antitrust moves in Europe and the Super Tuesday klaxon on the White House race.\nOf the so-called Magnificent Seven of leading stocks, only artificial intelligence poster child Nvidia managed to gain on the day. The S&P500 lost 1% and the Nasdaq 1.7%, although futures clawed back about a third of that ahead of Wednesday's bell.\nIn China and Taiwan, where the \"Mag 7\" revenue exposure is estimated to be close to 20%, the mood remained edgy after annual government plans were outlined by the National People's Congress on Tuesday. The CSI300 edged lower again overnight, even though Hong Kong recovered some losses.\nStrategists puzzled over how a modest 3% budget deficit target would contain enough of a fiscal boost to meet the government's ambitious 5% economic growth target for the year.\nAnd yet surging defence spending plans and the NPC report's removal of language about Taiwan that included the phrase \"peaceful reunification\" were most jarring to those worried about worsening geopolitics.\nThe prospect of Donald Trump's possible return to the White House, with promises of 60% tariffs on Chinese imports, will not have eased those concerns much as he dominated this week's slew of Republican primaries.\nOn Tuesday, Trump won the Republican votes in a dozen states and brushed aside rival Nikki Haley to all but clinch his third consecutive presidential nomination even in the face of a litany of criminal charges. Again casting Trump as a threat to American democracy, Biden took the equivalent Democratic party nods and set up what looks to be a re-run of the 2020 election race.\nElsewhere, and possibly partly related to the political uncertainties, gold and bitcoin remained well bid.\nBitcoin suffered vertigo on Tuesday after briefly hitting record highs above $69,000 and retreated sharply in a wild 14% intraday swing. But it was back higher about $66,500 on Wednesday, even if still shy of the new peak.\nGold prices also breached December's record peak briefly on Tuesday and held most of those gains today.\nThe dollar index were lower more generally.\nWith the Bank of Canada expected to leave its policy rate unchanged at 5% later on Wednesday, the focus will be on the accompanying statement as well as Governor Tiff Macklem\u2019s post-decision interview to see if an all-clear on inflation is forthcoming. Canada's dollar was steady overnight.\nBritain's pound and government bond yields pushed up ahead of finance minister Jeremy Hunt's annual budget speech. Despite the fragile state of the public finances, Hunt is expected to offer tax cuts to voters ahead of this year's election - including a reported 2 percentage point cut in social security contributions.\nKey diary items that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Wednesday:\n* Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivers semiannual monetary policy testimony before the House Financial Services Committee; Fed issues Beige Book on economic conditions; San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and Minneapolis Fed chief Neel Kashkari speak\n* U.S. Feb ADP private sector jobs report, Jan JOLTS job openings data, Jan wholesale sales/inventories\n* Bank of Canada policy decision\n* British finance minister Jeremy Hunt delivers annual budget to parliament\n* U.S. corp earnings: Campbell Soup, Brown-Forman, JD.com etc\n(By Mike Dolan, Editing by Alison Williamsmike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com)",

The company conducts underground and surface gold mining. It is also engaged in related activities such as exploration, processing, smelting and refining. Harmony is South Africa's biggest gold producer by volume with production of 1.47 million ounces in fiscal 2023.\nThe company\u2019s mining operations are principally concentrated in South Africa. The company has nine underground operations located in the Witwatersrand Basin. Additionally, Harmony has an open-pit mine on the Kraaipan Greenstone Belt along with several surface sources treatment operations. The Hidden Valley, which is located in Papua New Guinea, is an open-pit silver and gold mine.\nAlso, many of these mines are located in the Free State Province such as Welcom, Virginia, Tshepong and Bambanani, along with the Evander gold mine in Mpumalanga province, the Elandskraal mine at the West Rand goldfields in Gauteng province, and Kalgold operations in the North West province.\nThe company has discontinued its mining operations at Mt. Magnet and South Kalgoorlie in Western Australia as a strategic move. Harmony recorded sales of $2,774 million for fiscal 2023 (ended Jun 30, 2023).\nExploration Projects\nDomestic Projects: In South Africa, Harmony operates a total of nine underground operations, one open pit operation and several surface operations including an open cast mine, and nine processing plants, which are located in all of the currently known goldfields in the Witwatersrand basin of South Africa as well as the Kraaipan Greenstone Belt.\nInternational Projects: In Papua New Guinea (PNG), Harmony has full ownership of Hidden Valley, an open-cast gold and silver project that began production in June 2009, and 50% ownership of the Wafi-Golpu project. Harmony\u2019s exploration portfolio focuses principally on highly prospective areas in PNG and the Wafi-Golpu project in particular. Harmony expects that if Wafi-Golpu is developed, it will shift the company\u2019s geographical mix from more than 90% South African production to 75% domestic output and 25% offshore.

But disappointing results at the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest miner of the yellow metal signals companies may be struggling to take full advantage of sizzling demand.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nNewmont Corp. shares posted their biggest daily drop since 1997 on Thursday, tumbling 15% after the Denver-based company posted earnings, revenue and profit margins that fell short of analysts\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 estimates in the third quarter, dragged down by higher costs. The stock traded a further 3% lower on Friday, with top rivals Barrick Gold Corp. and Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. also retreating.\nAnalysts had high hopes for the industry. Gold has surged more than 30% this year, while fuel prices \u00e2\u20ac\u201d one of the miners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 key expenses \u00e2\u20ac\u201d have been easing. But Newmont\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s results revealed that big gold producers are still wrestling with inflationary pressures, especially regarding labor costs, that have lasted longer than expected.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u015bThere\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a potential read-through here, assuming Newmont\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s takeaways are accurate, that this is a risk factor for the industry,\u00e2\u20ac\u0165 said Josh Wolfson, a mining analyst with Royal Bank of Canada.\nNewmont earned 80 cents a share, well short of the average estimate of 89 cents among analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Revenue of $4.61 billion also trailed estimates, as did its gross profit margin, which slipped below 50%.\nThe company said it spent more to dig up the precious metal at its mines in Australia, Canada, Peru and Papua New Guinea than in the previous quarter. Capital expenses rose 10% due to expansion projects in Australia and Argentina, while some of the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s highest expenses came from major assets it picked up through last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s $15 billion takeover of Newcrest Mining Ltd.\nSome of those cost issues are specific to the company, and not necessarily indicative of a broader industry trend. Newmont is undertaking costly maintenance work at its Lihir mine in Papua New Guinea \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a notoriously complex operation in a remote region \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and it spent more to restart its Cerro Negro mine in Argentina after operations were paused due to the deaths of two workers in April.\nBut the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growing costs for workers could signal trouble across the industry.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u015bIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the labor costs where we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing that escalation,\u00e2\u20ac\u0165 Chief Executive Officer Tom Palmer told analysts in a conference call Thursday.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u015bWhether that be maintenance shutdowns, maintenance that you use to supplement your workforce, costs of running camps, costs of flying people to and from the camps \u00e2\u20ac\u201d that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s where we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re seeing some escalation beyond what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d assumed at the start of the year.\u00e2\u20ac\u0165\nMiners\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 pitch to investors is that they can offer better returns than owning the metal, partly due to greater investment options and shareholder payouts, but the industry has often underperformed over the past 15 years as major expansions left producers with big debts and angry shareholders.\nNewmont\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earnings also serve as a preview for Canada\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Barrick, which shares a giant mining complex with Newmont in Nevada. The Nevada mines produced less gold compared to the previous quarter.\nDespite investor disappointment, the gold miners are still being helped by the bullion boom: Newmont posted its highest quarterly profit in five years, raking in $922 million. Analysts expect Newmont is on track to net $3.2 billion in profit this year \u00e2\u20ac\u201d which would be a record for the company.\nEven after this week\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plunge, Newmont\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shares are up 15% this year.\nBarrick, Agnico and other big producers including AngloGold Ashanti Plc and Gold Fields Ltd. are also expected to rake in windfall returns by the end of the year.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u015bThe street expectations were too high,\u00e2\u20ac\u0165 said Carey MacRury, a mining analyst at Canaccord Genuity who recommends investors buy the shares. \u00e2\u20ac\u015bIt was negative, no doubt, but I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s as negative as what the market\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s telling us today.\u00e2\u20ac\u0165\n(Updates with Friday trading.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nThe Influencer Bros Selling More Baseball Bats Than the Pros\nHome Depot\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 12-Foot Skeletons Spawned an Industry of Giant Halloween Decor\n\u00c2\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

About 20 central banks are expected to stock up in the coming year, according to a World Gold Council survey.\n\u201cAs a diversification strategy, that makes some sense,\u201d said Charlie Robertson, head of macro strategy at FIM Partners. \u201cWhile gold does not pay interest, unlike reserves held in US treasuries, this hasn\u2019t mattered because the gold price has risen so much. It\u2019s been a profitable trade.\u201d The price of bullion has rallied 16% this year to $2,396.59 an ounce on Monday.\nAfrican nations were among the worst affected by the supply-chain disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic and the war in Ukraine and a steep increase in global interest rates that led to a selloff in their currencies and stoked inflation. Geopolitical tensions are again simmering with the conflict in Gaza, trade wars and concerns over what a second term for Donald Trump as US president might bring.\nSouth Sudan\u2019s central bank Governor James Alic Garang reiterated over the weekend that the nation plans to expand its reserve base by adding other resources such as gold. \u201cWe are in the stage of preparing policy documents and studying examples of other countries and lessons drawn,\u201d he said.\nThe Bank of Uganda plans direct bullion purchases from artisanal miners to mitigate \u201cthe declining foreign-currency reserves and address the associated risks in the international financial markets.\u201d Its foreign-exchange reserves have been hit by capital flight following anti-LGBTQ legislation that prompted the World Bank in August to halt new financing to the East African nation.\nNigerian lawmakers are also proposing that the central bank use gold to support and stabilize the naira and moderate inflation risks. The currency in Africa\u2019s most populous nation is the worst performing against the dollar globally this year after the Lebanese pound, partly due to devaluations aimed at creating a free-floating naira.\nLast year, the Central Bank of Madagascar made a move toward domestic gold purchases as income from vanilla exports declined. In June, Tanzania said it will spend $400 million on six tons of the metal.\nZimbabwe \u2014 which first flirted with gold coins in 2022 \u2014 launched a bullion-backed currency in early April to help curb an inflation spiral and exchange-rate volatility.\nSign up here for the twice-weekly Next Africa newsletter\nZimbabwe Gold, or ZiG, is backed by 2.5 tons of gold. It is the nation\u2019s sixth attempt at having a functioning local currency in 15 years, replacing the Zimbabwean dollar that lost 80% of its value against the greenback in 2024.\nGovernor John Mushayavanhu plans to ramp up reserves to over three tons this year and has stopped issuing gold coins, instead redirecting the bullion to the nation\u2019s vaults.\nOver the past two years, the World Gold Council has collaborated with central banks to structure domestic purchase programs from small-scale miners, Shaokai Fan, global head of central banks at the industry group, said in an emailed response to questions.\n\u201cCentral banks can add gold to their official reserves using their local currency, allowing them to grow reserve assets without having to sacrifice other hard-currency reserves,\u201d he said.\nStill, the gold rush doesn\u2019t signal expectations that bullion will become a \u201cliquid substitute\u201d for dollars, said Hasnain Malik, emerging market equity strategist at Tellimer in Dubai. \u201cHowever, for countries taking a view that either the price of gold is going to go up, the price of the US dollar is going to go down, or their access to US dollars may be compromised by sanctions then increasing the allocation of gold in their reserves might make sense.\u201d\nYou can follow Bloomberg\u2019s reporting on Africa on WhatsApp. Sign up here.\n--With assistance from Fred Ojambo, Godfrey Marawanyika, Nduka Orjinmo, Fumbuka Ng'wanakilala and Liezel Hill.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

The inflation numbers were slightly adjusted upwards for the next two years to come. That is going to be the real story here.\u201d\nEconomists and investors have been debating how soon policy makers around the world would start cutting interest rates even as the macro economic situation remains uncertain.

Chair Jerome Powell demurred when asked whether officials would lower rates at their coming meetings in May or June and repeated that the first reduction would likely be \u201cat some point this year.\u201d\nHowever, in a surprise move, the SNB cut its benchmark rate on Thursday, acting months before peers.

Amazon (AMZN) represents the tech stock, International Paper (IP) the defensive and Newmont (NEM) the uncorrelated. Each of them enjoys top Zacks Ranks and two of them are outperforming the market year to date.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nAmazon: Tech Giant Trading at a Historical Discount\nAmazon, a leading force in the technology sector and an unparalleled giant in the e-commerce and cloud computing spaces, presents a compelling investment opportunity. Despite the market's recent volatility, Amazon has demonstrated resilience and strength, making it an attractive option for investors seeking both growth and value. Additionally, Amazon currently boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions.\nAmazon's performance during the recent market sell-off has been notable. The company has maintained the best relative strength among the mega-cap technology stocks, reflecting its ability to withstand market pressures better than its peers in the current environment.\nOne of the standout aspects of Amazon's investment case is its robust earnings growth prospects. Analysts project Amazon's earnings per share (EPS) to grow at an annual rate of 29.6% over the next three to five years.\nThis forecasted growth rate is particularly impressive given Amazon's size and maturity. For a company of Amazon's scale, such rapid growth underscores its ability to continually innovate, expand its market presence, and drive profitability across its various business segments.\nAmazon's current valuation presents a unique buying opportunity. The stock is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 38.4x, which is significantly below its five-year median of 71.9x. To provide further context, this valuation is the lowest Amazon has experienced in the past decade, making it a historically attractive entry point for investors.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nNewmont: Riding the Trend Higher in Gold\nNewmont stands out as an attractive investment opportunity, particularly for those looking to capitalize on the strong upward trend in gold prices and the often-uncorrelated returns they offer. The company's robust fundamentals and favorable market conditions make it a compelling addition to any portfolio.\nNewmont currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, indicating upward trending earnings revisions and improving the odds of near-term strength.\nNewmont is also effectively riding the wave of increasing gold prices, which have recently reached new all-time highs. The company\u2019s performance is closely linked to the price of gold, and as gold continues to outperform the S&P 500, Newmont benefits significantly. Investors seeking exposure to the precious metals market can find Newmont to be an attractive option, as it stands to gain from any further appreciation in gold prices.\nNewmont's earnings per share (EPS) growth forecasts are particularly noteworthy. Analysts project EPS to grow at an impressive annual rate of 47.9% over the next three to five years.\nDespite its strong growth prospects, Newmont is trading at an appealing valuation. The company has a forward earnings multiple of 18.1x, which is relatively low compared to its industry peers. Additionally, Newmont boasts a PEG ratio of just 0.38, indicating that the stock is undervalued relative to its expected growth.\nFrom a technical analysis perspective, Newmont's chart setup is also quite promising. The stock is currently forming a bull flag pattern, a continuation pattern that typically precedes further upward movement. If Newmont can hold this pattern and break out above the $47.30 level, it would confirm a technical breakout, potentially leading to significant gains.\nImage Source: TradingView\nInternation Paper: Strong Performance During Market Correction\nInternational Paper has proven its resilience and defensive nature during the recent market volatility, emerging as a standout performer. While the broad market has experienced a 3% decline over the past two weeks, International Paper has gained 7%.\nInternational Paper holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, reflecting its strong fundamentals and positive outlook from analysts. The company's earnings estimates have been consistently revised upward across various timeframes, with FY25 earnings estimates seeing a notable 13.6% increase over the past two months.\nInternational Paper offers a substantial dividend yield of 4%, making it an attractive choice for income-focused investors. The company's commitment to returning cash to shareholders is further evidenced by its steady share buyback program over the last decade, which has reduced shares outstanding by 20% in that time.\nDuring periods of market correction, defensive stocks like International Paper often shine. The company's strong performance amidst market volatility highlights its ability to provide stability and relative safety for investors.\nImage Source: TradingView\nBottom Line\nIn this uncertain environment, I offer investors three options: investing in high-performing mega-cap tech stocks, shifting to more defensive names, or diversifying with uncorrelated stocks. Each of these strategies has its merits, and choosing the right mix depends on individual risk tolerance and investment goals.\nWhile market volatility can be unsettling, it also presents opportunities for strategic investment. Amazon, Newmont, and International Paper each offer unique advantages, whether through growth potential, defensive stability, or uncorrelated returns. By carefully selecting stocks from these categories, investors can navigate the choppy waters leading up to the presidential election and position themselves for long-term success.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Holding physical gold gives them \u201ccomfort\u201d in today\u2019s rapidly evolving climate, he added. Out of the 200 richest people in the world, more than one-quarter are based in Asia, data from Bloomberg show.\nIn the April to June period, purchases in the difficult-to-track OTC market totaled 329.2 metric tons, bringing total demand to 1,258.2 tons, according to the group\u2019s report. That\u2019s up 4% year on year. Without the strength of the OTC market, demand would have dropped 6% over the same period, due largely to a sharp drop in jewelry consumption.\nThe report sheds a little more light on the drivers in the world\u2019s gold market, which saw prices climb to eye-popping highs earlier this month. Driving prices is an expectation upcoming interest-rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve would attract more investors into the exchange-traded funds market. The metal has also been supported by continued demand from central banks and rising geopolitical tensions, including the tumultuous US presidential campaign, which boost its appeal as a safe-haven asset.\n\u201cThe undercurrent of all this is that central banks are still involved,\u201d Cavatoni said. \u201cIndia and Poland continued to buy\u201d even as China slowed down, he said. Gold buying by central banks is up 6% year on year but down from the brisk first-quarter pace. At the same time, price-sensitive consumers have reined in their jewelry purchases, which fell about 18% quarter-on-quarter, according to the report.\nMeanwhile, OTC demand was almost within striking distance of jewelry consumption, long one of the top drivers of global gold demand. Wealthy investors like the OTC market for its opaqueness. Most of the deals are done through dealers or between buyers and sellers directly, without an exchange platform or clearing house.\nThe WGC, an international trade association of gold producers that lobbies on behalf of its members, sees prices continuing to \u201cmaintain or slowly build on current levels\u201d in the second half. Gold is already up about 15% this year.\n--With assistance from Jack Witzig.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

(the \"Company\" or \"PPX\")(TSX.V:PPX.V)(BVL:PPX) is pleased to announce an updated Mineral Resource Estimate for the Callanquitas gold-silver deposit and a geological potential study on the Company's wholly-owned IGOR project, located in northwestern Per\u00fa, approximately 150 kilometers northeast of the city of Trujillo in the Huaranchal district of the La Libertad Region.\nThe NI 43-101 technical document shall be available within the regulatory filing timeframe and was carried out by the following independent consultants: a) Mining Plus Peru S.A.C., engineering firm responsible for the Callanquitas deposit resource estimate update and b) Geologica Groupe-Conseil Inc., responsible for the geological review, analysis and data compilation to determine the potential of the Igor Project.\nHighlights:\n-\nMeasured & Indicated (\"M&I\") Resources as oxides: 81,090 Au ounces and 2.9 million Ag ounces.\n-\nM&I Resources as oxides: 100,290 AuEq ounces at 4.70 g/t AuEq.\n-\nInferred Resources as sulfides: 34,450 AuEq ounces at 4.63 g/t AuEq.\n-\nPotential for additional resources in Callanquitas East as it remains completely open at depth and along strike to the north and south.\n-\nThe potential of Callanquitas West, which runs close to and parallel to the eastern zone and mirrors Callanquitas East, must be explored. Minimum exploration has been conducted in this zone.\n-\nThe presence of sulfide ore along strike to the south of the present workings has largely been ignored in favor of oxide ore and additional exploration has the potential to define sulfide structures, known from limited production to carry elevated silver grades.\n-\nThere is a high potential to increase resources in the areas of Portachuelos, Domo, and Tesoros\n-\nThe extension of Portachuelos, Domo and Tesoros zones is significant, each being 1.2 to 2 km in length with mineralized structures showing widths from 2 to 5 meters.\nJohn Thomas, CEO of PPX Mining commented: \"I am pleased to announce that resources from a section of the Callanquitas veins/breccias remain, allowing PPX to continue operations and to expedite the plant construction (for oxide and sulphide ore), while continuing to expand resources with diamond drilling campaigns from the subsurface and surface of the East and West Callanquitas veins/breccias, targeting the open areas along strike and at depth. Currently, the company, in coordination with its mining partner PLP, is conducting a drilling campaign from the subsurface, and we are excited that Canadian geology consultants are demonstrating the potential of the other mineralized zones of the Igor project, such as Portachuelos, Domo and Tesoros, with clear evidence of high gold and silver grades, offering an excellent opportunity to increase the company's resources.\"\nI. MINERAL RESOURCE UPDATE\nTable 1: Callanquitas Mineral Resource as of 30 September 2023\nNotes:\n-\nMineral Resources are not Mineral Reserves and have not demonstrated economic viability.\n-\nThe MRE has been categorized in accordance with the CIM Definition Standards (CIM, 2014).\n-\nAll figures are rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimates. Minor discrepancies may occur due to rounding to appropriate significant figures.\n-\nThe Mineral Resource was estimated by Ms Mu\u00f1oz QP(Geo) of Mining Plus, Independent Qualified Person under NI 43-101.\n-\nThe Mineral Resource is reported inside an underground shell with a cut-off grade of 2.00 g/t gold equivalent, estimated using a gold price of 1,800 US$/oz and silver price of US$ 20 US$/oz.\n-\nMRE is reported on a 100 percent basis within an underground shell. The gold equivalent is based in the following formula AuEq = Au + Ag*0.0066.\n-\nThis report is dated the 7 November 2023 and has an effective date of 30 September 2023.\n-\nThe cut-off date for mining depletion is 30 September 2023.\nMineral Resource Estimate\nThe Mineral Resources Estimate for the Callanquitas Deposit was prepared by Ms. Mar\u00eda Mu\u00f1oz, full-time employee of Mining Plus Peru S.A.C. The Mineral Resources within the Callanquitas gold-silver deposit are deemed potentially suitable for underground mining. These estimates are derived from drill holes and channel samples spanning the years 2006 to 2018, as documented in the 2018: \"Technical Report and Pre-Feasibility Study for The Callanquitas Gold-Silver Deposit, Igor Project, La Libertad Region, Peru\". Additionally, the data set includes 7 drill holes and 57 channels from 2019, along with 210 channels from 2023; the latest is in the deepest part to evaluate the expansion of resources at depth.\nPost-2018, mining activities in the deposit have enhanced the geological understanding, leading to a new geological interpretation. Furthermore, the estimated resources have been adjusted to account for updated economic parameters, ensuring compliance with the \"reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction requirement\". These different aspects have generated a material change in resources, mainly due to mining production which has generated a reduction in resources compared to those reported in 2018.\nThe Mineral Resource is reported inside underground optimized shapes with a reasonable cut-off grade of 2.00 g/t gold equivalent, based on a gold price of US$1800/oz and silver price of US$20/oz, mining costs and metallurgical recovery from the current mining activities.\nThe Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE), with an effective date of 30 September 2023, has been reported in accordance with the Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101) Standards for Disclosure for Mineral Projects. The estimation process followed the \"Estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines\" prepared by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM, 2019).\nCallanquitas comprises three structures, namely Callanquitas West and Callanquitas East, along with a minor structure named Callanquitas Sigmoid, the latest one is a smaller sigmoid of Callanquitas East. The determination of estimated domains involves a combination of these structures with their associated grade shell. The length sample exhibits variability, although composite lengths of 0.5 m were specifically chosen, representing a multiple of prevalent or dominant raw sampling intervals. Grade capping has been selectively applied to composited grade intervals within each estimation domain. The estimation methodologies for gold and silver grades predominantly employ Ordinary Kriging (OK) across most domains. However, Inverse Distance Square (ID2) was utilized for estimating Callanquitas Sigmoid due to the limited dataset available. To validate the results, bias checks were conducted using nearest neighbor (NN) estimation.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the MRE includes Measured, Indicated, and Inferred Resources; as Measured and Indicated resources in Oxides, there are around 663,700 tonnes with a gold equivalent grade of 4.70 g/t, with a metal content of 100,290 ounces of gold equivalent, and as Inferred in oxides there are around 528,500 tonnes with a gold equivalent grade of 4.40 g/t, with a metal content of 74,760 ounces of gold equivalent.\nSulfides have been classified as inferred because their information is limited. Mining Plus highlights that the initial Metallurgical tests carried out in-house have demonstrated high recoveries; however, for these resources, the recovery has been considered similar to that of oxides. There are 231,400 tonnes estimated with a gold equivalent grade of 4.63 g/t, with a metal content of 34,450 ounces of gold equivalent.\nMineral Resource Estimate Sensitivity\nMining Plus also evaluated the Callanquitas deposit mineral resource estimate for Mineral oxides by cut-off grade range between 2.0 gt/ AuEq and 7.0 g/t AuEq as per the table below:\nTable 2: Cut-Off Grade Sensitivity of Mineral Resources for Mineral Oxides\nGeological Data\nThe updated Mineral Resource Estimate includes drill and channel data as of August 2023. It includes an additional data set of 7 drill holes and 57 channels from 2019, along with 210 channels from 2023 made after the previous Mineral Resource dated December 3, 2018. All data information and underground mapping were used to generate a new geological interpretation and domains, resulting in a better understanding and confidence in the resource estimate. The updated mineral resource estimate includes only the Callanquitas deposit.\nGeology of Callanquitas\nThe gold/silver mineralization of Mina Callanquitas corresponds to an intermediate sulfidation system hosted in the magmatic-hydrothermal breccia units that break the Goyllarisquizga sediments. Mineralization in sediments occurs as the filling of secondary fractures due to the low permeability of the rocks. There is an intrusive that also cuts through the sediments where mineralization is medium to low grade.\nCallanquitas East structure has a strike of 5\u00b0 to 10\u00b0 NE and Callanquitas West has a strike of 340\u00b0 NE, in both cases the dip is around 87\u00b0E with variable thickness, ranging from 0.30 cm to 6.0 m. Sigmoid structure is part of the Callanquitas East structures and is located at the top with sigmoidal behavior.\nThere is still mineralization potential in the Portachuelos, Tesoros and Domo sectors that have been identified with early exploration, and that have not yet been investigated.\nFigure 1: Longitudinal Section with composites and block model coloured by gold equivalent grade - Callanquitas East\nFigure 2: Longitudinal Section with composites and block model coloured by gold equivalent grade - Callanquitas West\nQA/QC and Sampling Protocols\nPPX adheres to industry-standard exploration methodologies and techniques throughout its exploration process. The collection of drill core and underground samples is conducted under the supervision of the company's geologists, following established industry practices; data not aligned with the minimum standards set by PPX and industry practices has been excluded from the resource estimation process. Once transported from the drill platform to the logging facility, the drill data is meticulously compared and verified against the core in the trays. Subsequently, the core is logged, photographed, and split using a diamond saw before undergoing sampling. The sampling process involves bagging the samples, with the inclusion of quality control materials at regular intervals. These control materials consist of coarse blanks, certified reference materials, and duplicate core samples, serving to evaluate sampling precision and reproducibility. To maintain a secure chain of custody during sample transportation from the project site to the laboratory, groups of samples are placed in large bags that are sealed with numbered tags.\nThe majority of sample analyzes were conducted by SGS Laboratories, with ALS Chemex Laboratories contributing to a lesser extent, both laboratories located in Peru. The analytical method was consistent over time, including a multi-element technique with aqua regia digestion followed by ICP/AES detection, including silver values. Gold content was analyzed using a 30 g Fire Assay with an AAS finish. For silver results exceeding 100 g/t, a reanalysis was performed using aqua regia digestion with an ore grade AAS finish, while values exceeding 1,500 g/t underwent analysis using fire assay with a gravimetric finish. Regarding gold, values above 10 g/t underwent re-assay through Fire Assay with gravimetric finishing.\nII. GEOLOGICAL POTENTIAL OF IGOR PROJECT\nPortachuelos, Domo and Tesoros Mineralized Zones\nGeologica Groupe-Conseil Inc. (Geologica) has recently conducted evaluations of the geological potential in the three main mineralized zones (Portachuelos, Domo, and Tesoros). Geologica acknowledges that the exploration efforts undertaken by PPX have been adequately executed, employing exploration techniques and methodologies that align with standard practices in the mining industry. The location of these three zones is shown in figure 3. below.\nFigure 3: Location of Mineralized zones\nPast and recent work completed at the Portachuelos, Domo and Tesoros mineralized zones has indicated lateral extension potential at significant width and grades to justify infill and definition drilling on them. Just like at Callanquitas, interesting grades of gold and silver mineralization have been found in these three (3) main zones. Geologica has independently validated these results through an independent check sampling, encompassing 82 samples (33 channel samples on the surface and 49 drill hole samples), thereby confirming the outcomes obtained in prior work conducted by PPX\nThe Portachuelos breccia is oriented ESE-WNW. The Domo structures and the Tesoros mineralized zone strike NNE and observed onsite over 1.6 km. The Portachuelos structure and mineralized zone trends SE along lithological contacts and structures trending over 1.5 km and dipping steeply to the SW. Gold and silver mineralization, with locally visible silver, are found in breccias, epithermal veins and mantos that originally contained variable quantities of pyrite, 1% to 25% and massive, arsenopyrite, minor chalcopyrite (< 6% locally), galena (< 4% locally) and sphalerite (< 3% locally). These sulfides have been strongly oxidized to goethite and limonite to depths of 200 to 300 meters below surface. Ag/Au ratios are generally low (about 10:1) in the oxide portion but can increase to over 100:1 at the oxide-sulfide interface at the Callanquitas deposit and similarly at the Portachuelos, Domo and Tesoros mineralized structures.\nThese mineralized structures show good width from 2 m to 5 m and lateral length extensions from 1.2 km to 2.0 km and are hosted within brecciated and fractured quartzites of the favourable Chimu-Santa Formations and transition zones. The mineralization was injected within altered fractures, faults, fold flanks (mantos) and fold noses. The hot fluids were carrying metal ions from deeper within the intrusion or intrusive magma and formed epithermal veins once cooled. Just like at Callanquitas mine, depth extensions of the three zones (Portachuelos, Domo & Tesoros) could reach 500 meters or more and be open along strike.\nThe various geophysical surveys (Mag and IP-Resistivity-Chargeability) permitted location of the mineralized structures and their lateral and depth extensions in the central part of the property covering Callanquitas and Portachuelos. Once drilled, these mineralized structures and extensions will eventually permit ore resource calculation, if warranted. The recent core and channel sampling completed by Geologica has permitted to validate and corroborate the assay results previously obtained by PPX and confirm the presence of significant results as well as to observe the lateral continuity of the mineralized zones. The results of the IP-Resistivity survey and total magnetic survey carried out in 2008 are shown in fig 2 and 3 below.\nFigure 4: IP-Resistivity Survey\nFigure 5: Total Magnetic Survey\nDrill core sampling of the 3 areas has confirmed the mineralization present with grades above 1 g/t ranging from 1.06 g/t to 19.11 g/t Au and silver grades up to 560.94 g/t Ag over widths of 1.04 m to 9.05 m. The channel sampling at the surface has also confirmed the mineralization presence in the three areas with grades above 1 g/t Au ranging from 1.14 g/t to 4.50 g/t Au and silver grades up to 209.00 g/t Ag over channel widths of 0.5 m to 3.8 m. The drill holes have illustrated higher gold grades at depth and were observed in the sampled drill holes and surface channel sampling. The most significant diamond drill hole intersections for the Tesoros zone are shown in Table 3, those for Portachuelos in Table 4.\nTable 3: Most significant diamond drill hole intersections for the Tesoros zone\nTable 2: Most significant diamond drill hole intersections for the Portachuelos zone\nGeologica is of the opinion that the Property is one of merit with mineralized structures (Callanquitas, Portachuelos, Tesoros and Domo) and this warrants further exploration with the following Phases. Phase 1 surface exploration work program will consist of surface detailed geological mapping, soil geochemical surveys, geophysical surveys with Gravity, Magnetometric (Mag) and Induced Polarization (IP-Resistivity), at a higher resolution than the previous work, anomalous Geochem and Geophysical anomalies will be followed by mechanical trenching, detailed geological mapping and sampling, particularly over the three zone extensions (Portachuelos, Domo and Tesoros) and a first phase of drilling (1 DDH by zone). Phase 2 will consist in diamond drilling with both infill and definition drilling on all three (3) zones. A total budget of $4,223,000 is recommended.\nMarcial Gutierrez, General Manager and Chief Geologist, commented, \"We will continue to advance our exploration plans to expand the Callanquitas resource, in both, Callanquitas East, which is widely open at depth and along strike, and Callanquitas West, which is expected to mirror the high grade zones of the eastern breccia. Other key mineralized zones have been partially explored in the past and appear to be extensive and prospective. The Geologica Consultants recommendation for carrying out higher resolution geophysics and further drilling will certainly contribute to advance these key zones towards a resource definition, although widespread gold mineralization has already been found through the limited drilling in Portachuelos, making this massive structure a priority drilling target.\"\nQualified Persons and Technical Information\nThe Mineral Resources Estimate was estimated by Ms. Maria Mu\u00f1oz, a member of the Australian Institute of Geoscientists (MAIG), Ms. Mu\u00f1oz is a full-time employee of Mining Plus Peru S.A.C. and she is an independent Qualified Person (QP) as defined by the National Instrument 43-101.\nMr. Alain-Jean Beauregard, Mr. Eddy Canova, and Mr. Daniel Gaudreault, all full-time employees of Geologica Groupe-Conseil Inc. and recognized as independent Qualified Persons (QP's) under the National Instrument 43-101, conducted an assessment of the geological potential of the Portachuelos, Domo, and Tesoros mineralized zones.

After all, so far year-to-date, gold prices are up almost 15 percent (which is close to the S&P 500\u2019s 17 percent gains). In fact, gold is so popular right now that Costco can\u2019t keep their one-ounce bars in stock!\nAnd the economic environment seems primed to give gold even more of a boost: Gold has traditionally been seen as a hedge against inflation, and as we all know, inflation currently remains higher than the Federal Reserve would prefer. Plus, the metal is often touted as a doomsday must-have, and geopolitical tensions abroad don\u2019t look like they\u2019re abiding any time soon.\nBut don\u2019t let its shine blind you to what the data says. A Morningstar analysis finds that gold has actually underperformed stocks during every 10-year period for the last 100 years. Plus, gold doesn\u2019t generate any income, such as dividends. And its track record as a so-called inflation hedge has been spotty at best. According to CNBC, while gold investors saw massive gains during the super high inflation years of 1973-1979, investors lost an average of 10 percent from 1980-1984 when inflation was around 6.5 percent. Similarly, gold saw a negative return of 7.6 percent from 1988-1991 when inflation was about 4.6 percent. A mixed bag for sure.\nBut you\u2019re probably thinking, \u201cYeah, but it\u2019s tangible. I can hold it in my hand.\u201d True. But assuming the apocalypse doesn\u2019t hit any time soon, if you want to buy or sell physical gold at a dealer, there will likely be transaction fees that eat into your returns, not to mention potential markups. And it\u2019s only worth what someone is willing to pay for it on that particular day. Plus, there\u2019s the question of where are you going to store it? How are you going to keep it safe? And depending on how much of it you own, will you pay to insure it?\nEven if you \u2018hold\u2019 gold inside an investment, such as in a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF), there are likely going to be extra fees associated as well. For instance, the SPDR Gold Shares ETF charges a 0.40 percent annual carrying cost according to Barron\u2019s. And as for those \u2018gold IRA\u2019 commercials you see on TV? Be careful. It\u2019s a financial product that also comes with fees (which aren\u2019t always fully disclosed), commissions, and can be illiquid. Some gold IRA companies have even been accused of exorbitant markups, pushy sales practices, and in some cases, all-out fraud.",

With geopolitical tensions, high interest rates, and higher prices, investors are looking for ways to diversify their portfolios. In this regard, international stocks, which usually fly under the radar, are the most favorable option to explore. And they become even more appealing when they pay dividends.\nDividend stocks are the bread and butter of a diversified portfolio. They have represented nearly 34% of the market\u2019s overall return from 1940 to 2023, with even better performance during periods of high inflation. American companies are mainly known for paying dividends, but foreign counterparts are not far behind in this regard. Expanding your portfolio globally could help you avoid some of the specific challenges faced in the US. For instance, European banks are subject to tighter regulations, resulting in lower levels of interest-rate risk. With a more relaxed regulatory environment, dividends could potentially increase, and buybacks might rise in the international market. In fact, the markets with the highest yields are Norway, Hungary, Romania, and Iceland.\nIn 2023, Europe played a significant role in driving growth, with record dividend payouts growing by 10.4% compared to the previous year on an underlying basis, according to a report by Janus Henderson. The report further mentioned that annual dividends for the region grew from nearly $169 billion in 2020 to $301 billion in 2023. The trend is expected to continue this year as well as corporate leaders, especially in Europe and Japan, appear to be striking a balance between investing in capital expenditures and meeting operating cash flow requirements, while also showing an inclination to return cash to shareholders through dividends. According to FactSet data, European dividends per share are expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.5% by 2025.\nThere are no certainties in investing, of course. But we have compiled a list of some of the best dividend stocks from the international market to offer exposure to our readers.\nFor this list, we initially used a stock screener to identify foreign (non-U.S.) dividend stocks that are traded on US stock exchanges. Subsequently, from this dataset, we selected 12 stocks that boasted the highest number of hedge fund investors from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of Q1 2024. The stocks presented in the article were then arranged in ascending order based on the count of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nBarrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD) is a Canadian mining company that produces gold and copper. In the first quarter of 2024, prices for precious metals grew by over 8% due to increased purchasing by central banks and anticipation in the market that the Feds might cut interest rates most probably in June. Gold prices are expected to grow even further mainly due to geopolitical tensions and high interest rates, which creates a favorable environment for the gold mining company. Though the company\u2019s gold production declined to 940,000 ounces in the first quarter of 2024, versus estimates of 947,330 ounces, it still expects a gradual growth in its production throughout the year. This growth trajectory is attributed to the ramping up of operations at its Goldrush mine in Nevada and at Pueblo Viejo, in addition to the restarting of the Porgera mine in Papua New Guinea.\nIn 2023, Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD) produced 4.05 million ounces of gold, compared with 5.4 million ounces of gold produced by its competitor, Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM). But does that mean NEM is more efficient than GOLD? Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD)\u2019s twelve-month trailing operating margin, which identifies its operational efficiency and profitability, is slightly higher than NEM\u2019s at 24.54%. Though NEM produces a higher volume of gold, it has a negative profit margin of -20.33%, compared with a healthy profit margin of 12.58% for GOLD. This shows that GOLD has a healthy balance sheet as compared to NEM and does not have a higher production cost than its revenue. Moreover, GOLD has a lower debt-to-equity ratio of 14.67%, whereas NEM\u2019s ratio is 32.5%. This shows that, while the higher volume of production may attract investors at first glance, it does not necessarily reflect a healthy balance sheet. While gold prices are presenting a solid outlook for mining companies, we believe that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stocks.\nBarrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD) currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.13. We believe this suggests that the stock is cheap given its growth prospects. The company mainly offers performance-based dividends and its current quarterly dividend comes in at $0.10 per share. With a dividend yield of 2.31% as of June 3, GOLD is one of the best dividend stocks on our list.\nBarrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD) remained popular among elite funds at the end of Q1 2024, with hedge fund positions growing to 51, from 43 in the previous quarter, as per Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The collective value of these stakes is roughly $630 million.\nOverall, GOLD ranks 2nd among the best international dividend stocks.

Richard will make some opening remarks. Kathleen will review our slide materials, and then we'll open up the call for questions.\nRichard?\nRichard C. Adkerson -- Chairman of the Board\nThanks, David. Thanks, everyone, for joining us. It was a solid quarter, as you can see, and that's the result of the good work that our global Freeport team has accomplished and really proud of them and look forward to the future. We've got great outlook for our company; great outlook, long term, for copper and commodity that we base our strategy on.\nSo Kathleen will review with you the results of the quarter and talk about it, and we're making progress with this as far we had at our new smelter in Indonesia, and we'll review that as well. We have a new president in Indonesia, Prabowo Subianto. When Prabowo was a general three decades ago, we worked together closely on issues affecting our operations in Papua. He knows our business.\nHe's appointed a cabinet, which includes a number of cabinet members from Joko Widodo's cabinet and other people that we've known over the years. We look forward to working with him and believe his understanding of our business and of our location in Papua will be a big benefit as we work with this administration going forward. Kathleen, I'll turn the call over to you to review our results and our outlook.\nKathleen L. Quirk -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nOK, great. Thank you, Richard, and I'm going to start on our slide presentation, starting on Slide 3, with our highlights for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024. Our team continues to deliver on our operating plans and pursue value through enhancing efficiencies, managing costs aggressively and building value in our organic growth portfolio. You'll see here, we generated strong margins and cash flows during the quarter with $2.7 billion in EBITDA and $1.9 billion in operating cash flows.\nOur operating performance was supported by sales volumes exceeding guidance for both copper and gold and favorable unit cash cost performance compared to both our guidance and the year-ago quarter. We're focused on initiatives to build value from organic growth. At Freeport, we benefit from a large reserve and resource position with near-term, medium-term, and longer-term embedded growth options. The high potential innovative leach technologies are delivering results, and we've several ongoing initiatives to add scale and low-cost copper volumes in our Americas business.\nIn the first nine months of 2024, the incremental copper production from our REACH initiative was nearly 70% higher than the comparable period last year, and we have additional projects underway to build scale and improve on our U.S. cost position. We're also advancing our brownfield expansion opportunities, position the business for long-term growth to supply a market with increased requirements for copper. During the third quarter, we purchased 5.3 million shares of Cerro Verde in at-market transactions on the Peruvian Stock Exchange at a cost of $210 million, and that allowed us to increase our ownership in this highly attractive asset from the prior level of 53.6% to 55%.\nThe public firm Cerro Verde now represents about 4.3% of the outstanding shares. We ended the quarter in a strong position financially. And as we look forward, we're very optimistic about the markets we serve, our portfolio of high-quality copper assets, and the future prospects for strong cash flow generation to support investments and value-enhancing projects and returns to shareholders. We'll talk about markets on Slide 4.\nCopper prices again during the third quarter traded in a broad range. On the LME, they range between $3.91 and $4.47 per pound and on the COMEX exchange range from $3.94 per pound to $4.66 per pound. The settlement prices on the LME for the quarter averaged $4.18 per pound. As we look at the quarter and where prices traded, they largely followed macro sentiment which weighed global economic data and economic pressures in China against actions by the Fed and other central banks to cut interest rates and the potential for large economic stimulus in China.\nAt the micro level, we continue to see secular demand trends associated with electrification, providing strong demand for copper and offsetting the impact of a cyclical slowdown. In the U.S., our customers continue to report strong demand for power cable and building wire associated with substantial investment in electrical infrastructure and AI data centers. This growing sector more than offset weakness in traditional demand sectors in residential construction and autos. Demand from China continues to be supported by significant investments in the electrical grid and continued growth in China's production of electric vehicles.\nNotably, China's demand for copper continues to grow despite a weak property sector. Recent announcements for economic stimulus in China to support the country's economic growth targets could provide further support for metals demand as we move through 2024 and into 2025. As we've discussed in the past, copper is a foundational metal and a key component of electrification. Its physical characteristics and superior connectivity make it essential to electrification.\nNew massive investment in the power grid, renewable generation, technology infrastructure, and transportation are driving increased demand for copper and forecast call for above-trend growth and demand for the foreseeable future. As we look at these fundamentals of demand and match it up with supply, we continue to see a tightly balanced market in the near term and deficit conditions longer run. This is going to require new investments and innovative technologies to build supplies longer term. And at Freeport, we're driven to supply copper reliably and responsibly to a growing market.\nWith our leading industry position, our large-scale current operations, and our future growth pipeline, we're well-positioned to benefit from this fundamental outlook for copper. I remind everyone that, in addition to copper, we're also a major gold producer and are benefiting from increasing gold prices. We'll turn to operations on Slide 5, where we summarize the quarterly operating results by geographic region. In the U.S., we're continuing to take actions to improve efficiencies and cost performance to mitigate the impact of lower grades.\nWe have more work to do, but recent trends are improving. We're closely monitoring key performance indicators and seeing positive trends in recent months in asset efficiency associated with key areas of loading, hauling, crushing, and stacking. Our equipment reliability is a focus area, and we're making strides in reducing unplanned downtime. We're also rationalizing the use of contractors to reduce costs and allocated internal resources to our key focus areas.\nIn addition, success in our REACH initiative and further scaling incremental low-cost production will also drive reductions in our cost structure. In South America, the team at the Cerro Verde operation posted another solid quarter. Mill throughput exceeded 420,000 metric tons of ore per day during the quarter, and our mill recovery improved from last year's third quarter. Our unit net cash costs were slightly less than last year's third quarter after excluding the $0.12 per pound nonrecurring charge in the quarter for a new labor agreement.\nAfter reaching agreement with Cerro Verde's second union, we now have multiyear labor agreements covering Cerro Verde's hourly workforce. Mentioned earlier, we purchased additional Cerro Verde shares that gives us more exposure to this established, long-lived, and high-quality assets. In Indonesia, results were quite strong, and that's evidenced by a unit net cash credit of $0.71 per pound. The team is consistently delivering strong volumes of both copper and gold from our large-scale underground ore bodies.\nOur sales in the quarter were higher than our estimates going into the period with increased mill rates and oil grades. We also benefited from strong gold sales in the quarter, reflecting good production performance and a reduction in inventory from June 30 levels. Our near-term focus areas include continued strong execution of our operating plans, commissioning of a value-driven copper cleaning circuit at our site in Papua to support strong mill recoveries, and commissioning the precious metals refinery. We're also working to restore smelter operations following a recent smelter fire event, which we'll talk about more on the next slide.\nJust an update on where we are with the smelter. We made good progress during the third quarter on our commissioning and start-up. This is a project that our team managed construction in a challenging market in a very effective manner, but we did experience a setback last week on October 14 from a fire incident in a gas cleaning facility used in the sulfuric acid production process. Our safety protocols were effective, and the fire was extinguished in a short period of time without injury to our personnel.\nStart-up activities have been temporarily suspended as a result, while we conduct damage and root-cause assessments and develop our recovery plans. We've presented a picture on the slide that you can review. But as you can see, the incident affected a relatively small area of the overall project. We have teams actively engaged in planning the repairs and assessing lead times for replacement equipment.\nWe expect that the repair cost will be covered by our insurance programs, and we're also working with the Indonesian government on continuity of concentrate exports during the outage. Our mining operations in Papua have not been impacted, and our team is focused on restoring smelter operations safely and expeditiously. We look forward to achieving our objective of being a fully integrated producer in Indonesia, which positions us to secure a long-term extension of our operating rights there. We'll continue to be very excited about our innovative REACH initiative.\nOn Slide 7, you can see that early results continue to indicate significant value potential. Just a reminder, we achieved our initial targeted run rate of 200 million pounds per annum --copper per annum at the end of last year and are now driving initiatives -- to scale this initiative to 300 million to 400 million pounds per annum in the next couple of years. Ultimately, our goal was to achieve 800 million pounds per annum from this value-enhancing growth initiative. This is the size of a major new mine with low capital investment required, low incremental operating costs, and that will significantly enhance the value and competitive position of our Americas production.\nYou can see on the slide the significant growth in incremental volumes from these initiatives over the last several quarters. Our results have been achieved by enhancing heat retention in the leach stockpiles using data from sensors and analytics to identify targets and through deploying new operational tactics to direct solution injection to areas that were previously inaccessible. We continue to build confidence in boosting the run rate to 300 million to 400 million pounds per year during 2026. Some of the examples of the initiatives that are now underway that allow volumes in the future, including expanding our surface area under leach by using helicopters to install irrigation in areas previously inaccessible on the conventional techniques, and by scaling our targeted solution injection wells.\nWe're making great progress on our leach injection technology, great progress on our drilling. We're drilling much more efficiently, and we're able to increase the rate of well development. In parallel, we're also advancing innovation-driven initiatives which would support our ultimate objective of reaching 800 million pounds per annum. We believe there's significant opportunity from increasing heat to the stockpiles.\nWe're looking at adding heat to the leach solution using external energy or using pyrite-hosted ores to generate additional heat. Heat is a proven source to improve recoveries in this type of application. We're also continuing to advance testing of new additives at scale, and we look forward to reporting to you on our progress on these initiatives. On Freeport, we're really well-positioned to capture the value of this opportunity with an extensive inventory of substantial residual copper from material already mined, an industry-leading technical team with expertise in leaching technology, and a strong multidisciplined innovation team dedicated to this initiative.\nWe've got additional opportunities for growth beyond the leach opportunity, and you can see that on Slide 8 where we missed our organic growth projects. All of these projects are brownfield opportunities where we're leveraging existing assets and established operations. The leach-out initiative that we just talked about is our best opportunity to grow in the near term, and we're pursuing this initiative very aggressively. In the U.S., we also have opportunities for expansion at our Bagdad and Safford/Lone Star operations.\nAnd at Bagdad, we're advancing investments in automation, tailings, and energy infrastructure and expanded employee housing in this remote location to position us to execute the project more efficiently when the time is right. We don't have major permitting hurdles, and this is really a straightforward option. We're monitoring conditions and progress with our derisking initiatives and continue to expect to be in a position to make a decision next year on the expansion plans. In the Safford/Lone Star district, where we have a very large resource, we're engaged in studies to define a brownfield expansion.\nWe're targeting opportunities to more than double current production levels which are currently around 300 million pounds per annum. The large resource that we have at this location gives us an opportunity for Safford/Lone Star to become a generational cornerstone asset for Freeport and Arizona in the next decade. At El Abra, in Chile, this is our partnership with Codelco. We've -- as we previously reported, we completed pre-feasibility studies, and we're in the process of preparing an environmental impact statement which we expect to be completed by the end of next year.\nThe project involves investment in a new concentrator of scale similar to the size of Cerro Verde that we installed nearly 10 years ago, investments in the desalinization and pipeline system to support our water requirements. This project is large. It would provide 750 million pounds of annual copper production and 9 million pounds of annual molybdenum production. It's a long-lead project.\nIt would require something on the order of seven to eight years because of the time frame for permitting in Chile. And we're going to continue to review economics in the context of market conditions, but we believe this is a project that will be required in the future to support long-term copper demand trends, and this is a project in our portfolio that Freeport can execute. In Indonesia, we continue to progress our large-scale Kucing Liar development. This is a very large ore body adjacent to our existing operations, our existing ore bodies in Papua.\nWe expect to commence production by 2030. We're also conducting exploration below our Deep MLZ ore body. We're getting encouraging results. We expect that an extension of our operating rights in Indonesia beyond 2041 will set us up for additional long-term development options in this highly attractive district.\nBy pursuing all of these initiatives and advancing them, we're really focused on building optionality for future growth. We're going to continue to be disciplined in our approach and focused on targeting opportunities that can be executed over time that enhance long-term value. Our Slide 9 shows our three-year outlook, which we show every quarter and keep updated. This is the outlook for sales of copper, gold, and molybdenum and that you'll see the sales guidance is very similar to our previous outlook.\nWe also have updated our estimates for our unit net cash cost. We expect our average for 2024 to approximate $1.58 per pound. That is below our July estimate of $1.63 per pound and similar to our guidance at the start of the year of $1.60 per pound. We've got some details of this information by region on Slide 19 and the reference materials.\nSo as we move to cash flows -- margins and cash flows and putting together our projected volumes and cost projections on Slide 9 -- Slide 10, we show modeled results for EBITDA and cash flow at various copper prices, ranging from $4 to $5 per pound. These are modeled results using the average of 2025 and 2026 with our current volume projections and cost estimates and holding gold flat at $2,600 per ounce and molybdenum flat at $20 per pound. You'll see here that annual EBITDA at $4 copper would range from $11 billion, and it would go to approximately $15 billion per annum at $5 copper. Our operating cash flows at these product ranges would be over $7 billion at $4 copper to $10.5 billion at $5 copper.\nWe've got sensitivities that we've presented on the right of this chart. You'll note that we're highly leveraged to copper price with each $0.10 per pound equating to about $420 million in annual EBITDA. We're also leveraged to gold and will benefit from improving gold prices with each $100 change in gold prices approximating $150 million in annual EBITDA. With long-live reserves, large-scale production, Freeport is well-positioned to generate substantial cash flow to fund future organic growth and cash returns under our performance-based payout framework.\nMoving to the next slide, on Slide 11, we're showing our current forecast for capital expenditures for this year and next. Capital expenditures for 2024 are forecast at about $3.6 billion, and we estimate capital expenditures for next year to total about $4.2 billion. You'll see there have been some timing shifts between the two years. But over the two years, the changes are not material.\nWe'll note that the discretionary projects over this two-year period totaled $2.5 billion. This is a category that reflects the capital investments we're making in new projects that under our financial policy are funded with the 50% of available cash that's not distributed. They're value-enhancing projects -- growth projects provide good returns, and they're detailed on Slide 23 in our reference materials. As we look forward, we're going to continue to be disciplined in deploying capital and really focused on those opportunities that build value in our business.\nAnd finally, on Slide 12, we reiterate the financial policy priorities centered on a strong balance sheet, cash returns to shareholders, and investments in value-enhancing growth projects. We've got a very solid balance sheet, investment-grade ratings from all three agencies, strong credit metrics, and flexibility within our debt targets to execute on projects. We've distributed $4.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchases since implementing this framework got a very attractive future long-term portfolio that will enable us to continue to build value for shareholders. Our global team is very focused on driving value.\nWe're committed to strong execution of our plans, providing cash to invest in profitable growth and returns to shareholders. Thanks for everyone for your attention, and now I would like to open the call to take your questions.\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nChris LaFemina -- Analyst\nThanks, operator. Hi, Kathleen. Hi, Richard. I hope you're doing well.\nJust wanted to ask a couple of questions about Indonesia. And first, on the smelter fire with the insurance. Kathleen, you mentioned that the insurance would cover the costs for repairs. What if there is a situation where there's a delay to being able to export concentrate? Do you have any business interruption insurance that might cover the cost of loss shipments or any insurance that might cover the incremental royalties that you would have to pay on concentrate on exports?\nKathleen L. Quirk -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. The policy that we're referring to is a construction insurance policy that does not have business interruption coverage. It does cover the cost of the repairs. This is not a -- as you can see from the picture, it's not a big area, the affected facilities.\nIt is an essential area. The process is essential to the overall production of copper refining of copper, but it's not a large part of the overall facility. So our focus, Chris, really is getting the repairs done as quickly as possible. We do have discussions with the government.\nIt's in everyone's interest that that concentrate continue. We do have some flexibility within our existing quota of what we can ship through 2024, but we'll be asking for additional flexibility to make sure that we can ship everything that we produce in 2024. And then depending on the time frame that it takes to restore operations, we'll work with the government for continuity in the portion of 2025 that will be affected. It's in everyone's interest -- as you run through the math, the government gets essentially through taxes and royalties and dividends over 70% of the economics or the cash flow.\nSo it will be in everyone's interest for this to continue, and we'll work hard to get this operation restored as quickly as possible. But in the interim, we expect that we'll continue to be able to export.\nChris LaFemina -- Analyst\nVery good. Thanks. And then just secondly, on Indonesia as well. So the $1 billion of restricted cash, which I think is, what, 30% of the export proceeds, and it's held for 90 days in Indonesian banks.\nDoes that restricted cash policy continue even after the smelter ramps up? And can you just remind us of kind of the background behind that and what the reason for that cash restriction is? Thanks.\nKathleen L. Quirk -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. Chris, it refers to all exports, so it doesn't just affect copper, and it affects all exports in Indonesia required to hold in bank accounts for 90 days temporarily your export proceeds. And it was a measure taken last year by the government to look at its currency and fiscal situation. And so it don't -- not only applies to us but implies the oil companies and other people that are exporting.\nSo that will continue -- Unless the regulation is changed, that will continue beyond 2020 -- beyond the smelter start-up. So -- but it is there. We're earning returns on the investments. It's there temporarily.\nWe withdraw it after 90 days. And so it's -- right now, it's just held in deposit, but that's something that the government will continue to consider in light of its objectives.\nChris LaFemina -- Analyst\nThat's very helpful. Thank you for that.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Liam Fitzpatrick with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nLiam Fitzpatrick -- Analyst\nGood morning. A couple more on the smelter, I'm afraid. Firstly, I appreciate you're still assessing the situation, but can you give some high-level guidance on the length of delay that we're talking about? Is it three months? Could it be substantially longer than that? And then in terms of the government reaction, do you think -- and the export extension, do you think this will be just a formality and received in good time? Or could there be a risk that it could be delayed beyond the year end? And then a quick one, just separate to the smelter on the Cerro Verde stake increase. It's small but probably the best type of M&A that you can do.\nIs this a one off? Or do you think there could be more opportunities to increase your stake? Thank you.\nKathleen L. Quirk -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Liam. On the time frame for the repairs, we don't have that information yet. This is an event that happened essentially a week ago, and our teams have been on the ground inspecting the damaged equipment, determining what needs to be replaced, what does not need to be replaced, and we're working in parallel with our vendors on understanding lead times for various equipment. The early results in terms of the area affected, not everything on the structure was damaged.\nWe were fortunate we did not have big impacts to structural steel. There will be some equipment and piping that needs to be replaced, and so we're just working through that right now, trying to understand what the lead times are for this equipment. This is not equipment off the shelf so will need to be fabricated, and we'll work quickly. The fortunate thing is, right now, it's not a time in the market where supply chains are real tight.\nSo we're getting really good response from our vendors, working to understand the root cause of this and when -- the vendors are involved in that exercise with us as well. But -- so we don't have a specific time frame, other than to assure you that we've got the right teams in place. We've got the right organization that's working through this in a professional way to expedite what we can and get this back up and running so that we can achieve our start-up goals. The government has been supportive.\nThey sent -- we have our own fire department there at the site, but the government also sent support and has been very supportive. They've been looking also -- the police, as was normal procedure, looking at the investigation of the causes, and we're collaborating on that exercise as well. I think if you look at the world and these smelters, this is not the first time there's been a fire in Indonesia. The people that we are talking with understand the hazards involved in these types of operations.\nWe're working hard and designing these operations so that they don't have hazards. But if you look at history, there have been have been other similar-type incidents, so they understand it. They understand our good faith in getting the smelter completed, and they also understand the economics that this continuity will benefit them as we go forward. So I think we'll just continue to work collaboratively to make sure that all of the impacts of this are mitigated, and they can be mitigated through insurance and through continued exports.\nAnd that's what we want to make sure that we do to every extent possible is mitigate the impact of this incident. With the Cerro Verde question, Cerro Verde has a public market that trades in the relatively small float that trades on the Peruvian Stock Exchange, and so we're interested in buying more if there's opportunities to do it. There were some funds that were interested in selling, and we were able to pick up those shares. But it's high-quality asset, very difficult to replicate.\nAnd so to the extent there are opportunities to purchase additional shares, we're interested in doing that, but that takes a willing seller as well. So we'll just continue to monitor that as we go forward.\nLiam Fitzpatrick -- Analyst\nOK. Thank you.\nOperator\nOur next question will come from the line of Bob Brackett with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.\nBob Brackett -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning. A question back to Indonesia, but this is around IUPK. If I overly analyze the 2Q versus 3Q, there was an expectation that you might file for IUPK extension in 2024 in the 2Q release.\nBut in 3Q, it feels a little more vague. Am I over interpreting? Or is there anything about the end of the year and filing that that matters to you specifically?\nKathleen L. Quirk -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nNo. I mean, we --\nRichard C. Adkerson -- Chairman of the Board\nKathleen, let me make one comment here first. We had hope based on discussions that go back a couple of years that we would be able to accomplish this during the term of Joko Widodo. And with everything that went on with the transition to the new president -- the election occurred months ago, but the transition was -- occurred later, we just weren't able to get it. There's an established regulation in place that provides us the ability to file for it, and we'll be working with the new government and working on the right time to do that.\nWe feel confident that it will happen.\nBob Brackett -- Analyst\nVery clear. A quick follow-up. Can you tease us a little with the pre-feasibility study launched on Safford/Lone Star, what should really broad goalposts, what sort of opportunity should we think about?\nKathleen L. Quirk -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThis is a very large resource. We've been doing a lot of drilling over the last several years and have identified a resource that is multiples of the current reserve, and it's in an established area. It's over the mountain range from Morenci, where we've operated for a century more. And Safford is relatively new.\nI mean, it's one of the newest mines in the U.S. We brought it online in 2007, '08 time frame and then have expanded it to date. So what we have is this opportunity to a vision where you could have another cornerstone asset in this district where we've got talented workforce. We've got an established community support, and we've got a resource.\nSo you could have an operation there that is both doing leaching, which that's what -- it's 100% leach operation today but could add additional milling there to essentially double the production. The resource might support even more than doubling, but what we're looking at is the opportunity to go from 300 million pounds of copper a year there to 600 million and through an efficient leasing and milling operation. And so what we're doing now is designing based on the resource what the next step would be in terms of expanding the operation, and we're all very excited about it. We're pushing to really define what it could be.\nWe know from the resource, it could be something that will be with us for a very long time, and so that's the objective. We're doing the pre-feasibility study work, and we'll have more information next year about what a project could look like. One of the things that is important to recognize here is it's not like El Abra in that a lot of us is going to -- El Abra is a very attractive project, but it takes a long time because of the permitting requirements. We don't have the same degree -- we don't believe we'll have the same degree of permitting required for this that you would have in something like El Abra.\nSo it's possible that if this is fast tracked, it could come online not too much different than where El Abra. So that's exciting as well. We're fortunate at Freeport that we have these brownfield opportunities. We have big resources, and we have the community support that allows us to grow, and that's what we're doing.\nWe're focused on technology. We're focused on automating what we do to make sure that we can be as efficient as possible long term. And I think technology, not only in our REACH initiative, but also in our mining initiatives, is going to turn the corner and make our U.S. operations much more attractive as we go forward.\nBob Brackett -- Analyst\nGreat color. Thanks for that.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nMichael Dudas -- Analyst\nGood morning, David, Richard, and Kathleen. Maybe you could shed -- I appreciate the comments about North America and the impact on some of your initiatives on the cost side, but maybe you could give a sense of how quickly some of these efficiency initiatives will be moving forward. Looking at the marketplace for labor, how -- where do you stand on that? And is there a normalized level or expectation away from the improvement from the leaching contribution that we'd see a moderation in the mining cost, of course, recognizing the great issues that you've been dealing with?\nKathleen L. Quirk -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. Well, over the last several quarters, we've had two -- it's been twofold. One is we -- starting in '22, we had rising costs, and that came at a time when we started getting into lower grade. So we've had two things that we've been dealing with.\nThe good news is that we're not seeing the rise in costs like we were previously. And actually, there's some things that -- like energy that have come -- that are actually -- have trended lower, but the thing we're focused on now is making sure that our assets are as productive as possible. It's -- we did some benchmarking against our South America operations. And back in 2022, the two were pretty much on top of each other in terms of their unit costs.\nNow when we look at the comparison, there's a big gap between South America and North America, and that's mainly this grade issue. We haven't had the grade decline in South America like we've had in North America, but that requires us to be more efficient, and we think we can do that. We think that we can be more productive with our equipment, more productive with our people. As our people are getting better training, more experience, that is a big help.\nThe other issue that we're making some progress on is downtime. We've had some experience in recent years with premature equipment failures. We're turning the corner on that. We're focused on systems and planning our downtime so that when we do go down for planned maintenance that the downtime is delivered, the project is delivered on the cost we expected and in the time frame we expected.\nBut it's a lot of basics, but we're making progress. When we look at all the KPIs that we track, the key performance indicators that we track, we're seeing better utilization, better availability on our equipment than we've experienced in recent quarters. And that's just going to have to continue to be the case that we have to work day in, day out to achieve better asset availability and productivity metrics. The other thing we're focused on is contractor costs.\nWe've had some labor rate increases that have not been insignificant, but the contractor costs have been even more significant. So what we're doing there is we're reducing the amount of contractors that we have in our operations. We're down about 10% or so from where we were, and we're allocating our own internal resources differently to reduce costs there. That will be something we're continuing to work on.\nThe other thing we're doing in our global supply chain group is leading an effort to really push back what's happened over the last couple of years with component parts and all aspects of maintenance supplies. People are trying to push through cost increases, price increases on equipment and parts, and we just don't see the data that supports that. So we're pushing back on that. We're looking to bring costs back down to reasonable levels where our vendors can generate returns but not egregious returns.\nSo we've got multifaceted initiatives going on. As you mentioned, the REACH initiative is one component of that that's going to help a lot, but there are other areas that we've got teams focused on, and we will make progress. If we continue to follow these key performance indicators and achieve these targets that we've set out that each of our teams know about now what we need to do, we will bring down the cost, even though grades may not improve. So that's something that we're committed to.\nAnd I think you'll start to see in 2025, all other things being equal, in terms of input costs, but you'll see our unit cost trending lower in the U.S. compared to where they are now. And I'll ask Josh or Maree, either of you, if you want to add to anything I commented on costs. This is a big effort for our whole team.\nSo anybody else want to comment, please do.\nJosh Olmsted -- President and Chief Operating Officer, Americas\nKathleen, I think you touched on everything that I was going to touch on. I mean, really the laser focus by the team on efficiencies, productivities, and managing our costs via contractor spend are really key in driving our unit cost down, in addition to the work in the maintenance and reliability space. The more reliable our equipment is, the more productive it is. And therefore, that just helps all the way across the board, not only from a devisor perspective, but also from a cost perspective, because when equipment is down, it typically costs more.\nSo you touched on the things that are the most important for us, and we're very, very focused organizationally on those key performance indicators so that we can manage that stuff on a day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month basis and drive it in the direction we need to go.\nKathleen L. Quirk -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Josh.\nMichael Dudas -- Analyst\nYes. Thank you, Kathleen. Thank you, Josh. Look forward to the progress.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nOrest Wowkodaw -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning. My question is around the same lines with respect to cost. I mean, with North American cost above $3 and South America around $2.50, I understand that you're working on some cost-reduction initiatives.\nBut should we think about sort of the go-forward run rate for costs in North America were in the $2.50 to $3 range post these initiatives with South America more in the $2.25 to $2.50 a pound? Like is that just the new reality of today's cost environment?\nKathleen L. Quirk -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nI think, directionally, that's right. Now to the extent that we can bring down some of these input costs, that will help. But I think that is -- what you're saying is accurate. Now I want to remind everybody that our REACH initiative, if we're successful there and continuing to scale, that's a big deal.\nSo you're talking about costs in the U.S. for -- average today in the $3 range. This REACH initiative is bringing on incremental pounds at a cost of less than $1, and so that will bring down the average as we scale it more because the reason why it's so attractive is because this is getting more copper out of what's already been mined. So the mining cost is a big part of the overall cost of copper production, and this is taking advantage of material that's already been mined and investing some incremental costs to get more.\nSo that could really make a difference. And that's why we're talking about it so much, and we're making progress on it. It could really change the cost structure in the U.S. And we've got some opportunities for leach, in particular, at El Abra that we're pursuing, but the meaningful impact will be in our U.S.\noperations, principally Morenci and Safford and our Chino mine.\nOrest Wowkodaw -- Analyst\nJust as a follow-up to that, I mean, we've seen North American costs creep up seemingly quarter over quarter. Where do you see that inflection point? Should we -- do you think we peaked here at $3.14 a pound? Or could we still see those costs flatline or go higher before they start coming down on the new leaching?\nKathleen L. Quirk -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nOur objectives and our targets are that they'll come down. So we should -- you should see -- in 2025, you should see lower costs from what we had in 2024. Now that depends on moly and some other things. But just site production costs, you should see costs trending lower in 2025 from where they were in '24.\nOrest Wowkodaw -- Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\nOur next question will come from the line of Daniel Major with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Major -- UBS -- Analyst\nHi there. Can you hear me OK?\nKathleen L. Quirk -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes.\nRichard C. Adkerson -- Chairman of the Board\nYes. We can hear you, Daniel.\nDaniel Major -- UBS -- Analyst\nGreat. Thanks for the question. Yeah. The first one, just on the sort of M&A capital allocation, you've acquired some more stock in Cerro Verde.\nBut as you mentioned, you need a willing seller. I guess two parts to the question. Assuming you can't buy any more stock in Cerro Verde going forward, should we expect Freeport share buybacks in Q4 and into Q1 of next year? That's the first part of the question.\nKathleen L. Quirk -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. Well, I was just going to say, Richard, we're following our framework for cash allocation for shareholder returns. And so we deploy 50% of cash flow to cash flow available after capex, excluding the discretionary items, of 50% to shareholder returns and 50% due to organic growth. And so I -- we do expect that share purchases, to the extent that we're generating cash above the current dividend levels, will be available for us in the future to continue to buy stock back.\nThe Cerro Verde was opportunistic. If there are opportunities in the future to buy Cerro Verde stock, it's -- like we said, it's a very high-quality asset, and so we'll -- that's really just an opportunistic purchase.\nRichard C. Adkerson -- Chairman of the Board\nWe have ongoing discussions with our shareholders, and there's obviously different views about dividends versus stock buybacks, but this is something we actively discuss with our board at every meeting, and we'll be making decisions. It's great to be in a position now to be able to have those discussions. And we're well below our debt level targets, so we'll be able to execute this policy that Kathleen just spoke with you about.\nDaniel Major -- UBS -- Analyst\nGreat. And maybe a follow-up, if I could, just on bigger-picture M&A. You're obviously seeing larger-scale transactions starting to become more prominent in the sector. Is this something that you see as an opportunity going forward before some of these larger assets potentially get kind of taken off the market?\nKathleen L. Quirk -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. We monitor market.\nRichard C. Adkerson -- Chairman of the Board\nI've said for a long time that M&A is coming in our industry, and it certainly will. And we're engaged in observing what goes on discussions with our bankers and with other companies to see what opportunities might arise, but M&A is not fundamental to our strategy. I mean, we are focused and have opportunities to grow value for our shareholders organically, and that's our primary focus. But we'll be in the marketplace and prepared to respond to opportunities.\nI've always felt that the best M&A comes from opportunities as opposed to predetermined strategic moves.\nDaniel Major -- UBS -- Analyst\nVery clear. Thanks very much.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of Lawson Winder with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nLawson Winder -- Analyst\nHi. Thank you, operator. Good morning, Kathleen and Richard. Thank you for taking the question, and thanks for the update.\nJust wanted to ask a -- I just wanted to ask about capital allocation, particularly with respect to the larger projects. So I'm thinking of Bagdad and thinking of El Abra. I'm thinking as now Lone Star. Would it be fair to characterize your decision-making as one where you would wait on a decision on Bagdad until you have the information on the study that you're now expecting at the end of next year for both El Abra and Lone Star?\nKathleen L. Quirk -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, Bagdad is a project that we can execute in the near term. We do want to -- and we've got the information on El Abra, so we know the comparison between El Abra and Bagdad. For Lone Star, we need to get these studies done, and that's why we're pushing to get the studies done next year that will help us assess that. But Bagdad is something that can be executed in a three- to four-year horizon.\nLone Star/Safford will take longer to evaluate. But -- yeah, it's -- in a perfect world, we would like to have -- and that's the beauty of Freeport in that we have -- we manage all of these assets, and so we can look at capital allocation as to where it makes the most sense, where it has the best impact, the best returns for us to evaluate projects next to each other. So that's a real advantage, and we do that regularly to make sure we're allocating capital to the projects that make the most sense, not just to the projects that we can do. We want to invest our capital in the projects that drive the most value.\nThere are other considerations in terms of time frames that can be executed within, etc. But generally, that's our philosophy is to allocate capital to the most valuable projects within our portfolio, to compare and contrast those. But -- so we will have more information on Safford next year and look at that next to Bagdad, but we think that Bagdad will -- that the project will benefit back that long term. Again, we're talking about -- we've got an 80-year-plus reserve life there, and so that is a place where we feel investments make sense.\nAnd that's part of what guides our investment decisions is where do we have the resource, and in this case, an established operation that we can leverage from. So -- but they're not mutually exclusive. We can do more than one project. And so our goal is to -- if we've got projects that create value and we can execute those efficiently, we want to advance those aggressively.\nLawson Winder -- Analyst\nOK. That's perfect, actually. And then just my follow-up would be just thinking about 2025 capex, I mean, how would you handicap thinking about that? I mean, should we be thinking about 2025 capex being sort of in line with 24 x smelter? Or should we be thinking about the possibility of major capex commitment at some point in 2025 that that would be cash outflow next year?\nKathleen L. Quirk -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. At this point in time, we don't see a major change to '25 capex. We do have some investments in our discretionary bucket in '25 to advance Bagdad, to derisk Bagdad. We're making some investments in power infrastructure.\nWe're making some investments in tailings work that we're doing, that we'd have to do anyway longer term. But -- so we do have some investments in Bagdad in 2025 to derisk the overall project. But I don't see, based on the projects we're talking about in terms of El Abra, Bagdad, Lone Star, I don't see significant capex above what we have in our 2025 plans, but we'll continue to review those. If there's opportunities for us to advance things and that makes sense, we'll certainly be open to it.\nBut at this point in time, this is our best estimate of what capital will look like in 2025.\nLawson Winder -- Analyst\nYeah, fantastic. Thanks again for the update, guys.\nKathleen L. Quirk -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Lawson.\nOperator\nOur final question comes from the line of Bill Peterson with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nBennett Moore -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\nGood morning, Kathleen and Richard. This is Bennett on for Bill. I wanted to start real quick if you could provide any updates on some of your smaller and near-term discretionary projects on Slide 23, namely increasing stacking at Lone Star, Atlantic Copper recycling, and the improvements of the Grasberg mill.\nKathleen L. Quirk -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes. Then what -- just for everyone else, what he's talking about is us the discretionary projects that are included in our capital that generally are not maintenance related that actually have investment returns associated with them. The Lone Star oxide expansion is coming to an end. We're going to be completing that in the 2025 time frame, and so that will allow us to basically sustain 300 million pounds of copper per annum.\nBeyond that Lone Star, we're talking about a major expansion, and that is what we were talking about earlier studying. At Grasberg, we're installing a copper cleaner that will allow us to improve our concentrate grades and our metal recoveries. That investment is -- essentially, we've completed the major construction, and we'll be installing that project, commissioning that project here in the fourth quarter. So that one is coming to an end.\nYou won't see any significant cost for that one in 2025. The circular project at Atlantic Copper is taking advantage of Atlantic Copper's position in the market, the existing infrastructure, and we're developing a new circuit there to recycle scrap, electronic scrap material. And that project is underway. It's expected to be in production next year, at the end of next year, and it is going to add to Atlantic Copper.\nThis may not be significant overall to Freeport, $60 million per annum, but it's significant to Atlantic Copper and particularly in the context of low TCRCs. This allows Atlantic Copper to continue to generate business outside of copper, and it's -- Atlantic is very well suited to do this kind of work and recycling the material that are in phones and other things that have value. So that project is in construction, and as I said, expect to be completed next year.\nBennett Moore -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\nAnd then real quick, if I could just ask about the progress of the cleanup work going on at Grasberg, you've had success with placing this remote pumping equipment that you were speaking to last quarter.\nKathleen L. Quirk -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes. We've made a lot of progress there. Things are -- continue to go very well at Grasberg. The team did well this quarter and actually exceeded the forecast, was able to get more tons through the mill than we had forecast, and grades were strong.\nAnd so operations there are continuing to go very well.\nBennett Moore -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\nThank you. Best of luck going forward.\nKathleen L. Quirk -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, everyone.\nOperator\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to management.\nKathleen L. Quirk -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Regina. Thank you, everyone, for all your good questions and participation, and we look forward to continue to keep you updated.

On the surface, the quarterly financials were overall positive and unremarkable compared to expectations. Unfortunately for shareholders, the market focused on concerning new developments on the expense side.\nRising costs represent a new challenge\nNewmont reports \"Costs Applicable to Sales\" (CAS) for each of its mines and on a consolidated basis. Investors track these costs per ounce of gold produced by the company, providing an important data point when forecasting cash flows. Newmont's CAS per ounce was $1,207 last quarter, up more than 30% year to date and well above most analyst expectations. Mining companies are dealing with rising costs for several key categories, including labor and energy. Newmont is experiencing these issues in several different countries around the world, so it's not a simple fix or one underperforming location. It's keeping the company from fully exploiting the upside from higher gold prices.\nStocks often rise and fall along with forecasts for a company's future cash flows. Great quarterly results are sometimes overlooked when there are ominous signs for the future, and that's exactly what happened to the mining stock. Newmont's valuation already reflected the impact of rising gold prices -- the stock was up nearly 30% YTD at the start of October. Wall Street analysts slashed their revenue and earnings estimates for next year in response to the new CAS data.",

Newmont couldn't live up to the hype 2024 has been a phenomenal year for gold stocks and most mining stocks. In fact, until the recent sell-off, shares of Newmont and the price of gold were both outperforming the S&P 500 index (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) year to date -- which is impressive considering it has been an excellent year for the broader market. Even after the recent pullback, Newmont stock is still up 19% year to date. The main issue is that expectations got ahead of reality.

The sell-off may seem strange, given gold prices are still hovering around an all-time high.\nHere's what's driving the sell-off in the dividend stock and why there may be better options for investing in gold than mining stocks.\nNewmont couldn't live up to the hype\n2024 has been a phenomenal year for gold stocks and most mining stocks. In fact, until the recent sell-off, shares of Newmont and the price of gold were both outperforming the S&P 500 index (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) year to date -- which is impressive considering it has been an excellent year for the broader market. Even after the recent pullback, Newmont stock is still up 19% year to date.\nThe main issue is that expectations got ahead of reality. In the short term, it can be difficult for gold miners to keep pace with the price of gold because they have to spend more to produce more, and capital spending plans are usually made based on midcycle expectations rather than overextending at the top of a cycle.\nAnalysts expected Newmont to book $0.86 in adjusted earnings per share (EPS), but it only notched $0.81 in adjusted EPS. Still, Newmont's results were incredibly impressive and included $760 million in free cash flow (FCF). However, third-quarter sales grew 4.6% quarter over quarter compared to a 7.1% increase in costs applicable to sales. Costs outpacing sales growth is never a good sign because it can lead to lower margins and worse-than-expected earnings growth.\nNewmont bought back $500 million in stock during the quarter and returned $786 million to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividend payments -- which was more than the FCF it earned for the quarter. Newmont's dividend payment can vary based on the performance of the business, but it currently sits at $0.25 per share per quarter. Some investors may have preferred Newmont to pay a higher dividend than buy back stock. After all, Newmont's average price paid per share was $53.16 -- which is higher than the closing price of the stock after Thursday's sell-off.\nStill, the sell-off in Newmont is probably due more to the stock price getting ahead of itself than poor results. There's a lot to like from Newmont's results and its fourth-quarter guidance. As of Oct. 23, the stock was up over 50% in the past year compared to a 34.3% increase in the price of gold. Newmont had a huge surge in October before the recent sell-off. So, there was a lot of pressure on Newmont to deliver a perfect quarter, which it didn't do.\nOther ways to invest in gold\nMiners can be a great way to invest in gold if they can manage costs and invest in efficient mines. As mentioned, Newmont was a better investment over the last year than gold or the S&P 500 until the recent sell-off. And since Newmont pays dividends, it offers a way to earn passive income from gold, whereas buying gold bullion doesn't pay dividends.\nHowever, a simpler way of investing in gold than mining stocks is to buy an exchange-traded fund (ETF) such as SPDR Gold Shares(NYSEMKT: GLD) or the iShares Gold Trust(NYSEMKT: IAU). As you can see in the following chart, both ETFs have closely followed the price of gold.\nBoth financial products use a custodian to hold their physical gold, so their value is backed by tangible assets. The iShares Gold Trust has an expense ratio of 0.25%, or $2.50 per $1,000 invested compared to a 0.4% expense ratio for SPDR Gold Shares. Both expense ratios are reasonable considering buying gold usually involves paying a fee above the spot price, not to mention there are storage and security costs involved if you want to hold gold safely rather than under your mattress.\nInvest in gold in a way that works for you\nInvestors may want to invest in gold for a variety of reasons. But the simplest is that it is an alternative asset to stocks and bonds that can do well amid times of uncertainty. It is also a store of value that doesn't depend on the U.S. dollar or the U.S. economy.\nIf the main reason you're thinking about gold is its proven value, even during economic turbulence, then it makes more sense just to buy shares in a gold ETF than go with a gold mining stock with way more variables. However, if you already own gold bullion or a gold ETF and are looking for an additional way to invest in the yellow stuff, then researching gold miners could make sense. There are also gold miners' ETFs, such as the VanEck Gold Miners ETF, in which Newmont is, unsurprisingly, the top holding.\nIn sum, it's best to approach investing in gold in a way that suits your objectives and your liquidity needs. And for most folks, a gold mining ETF is probably a better buy than Newmont.\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) stands against the other dividend stocks under $25.\nDividend stocks have remained important for investors, standing the test of time regardless of the market conditions. Dividends have historically contributed approximately one-third of the market\u2019s total return since 1960. Among dividend strategies, investors tend to favor those that emphasize dividend growth over high yield. One of the main reasons for this inclination is that as these companies show more tangible results, investors gain confidence from seeing improvements in free cash flow, earnings, and dividend growth during a recovery, compared to more speculative options. In addition, as interest rates decrease with Federal Reserve rate cuts in an economic recovery, yield-oriented investors shift their investments from cash to dividend-paying stocks.\nAccording to analysts, due to volatile economic conditions since 2020 and ongoing market uncertainties affecting corporate earnings, high-yielding companies lacking strong financial stability and discipline may face challenges sustaining future dividend payouts. These companies could be vulnerable to potential dividend cuts or suspensions. On the other hand, dividend growth strategies have demonstrated their effectiveness in both rising and falling interest rate periods. The Dividend Aristocrats index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, delivered a 14.26% return during the falling interest rates period between May 2005 and March 2024, while high dividend stocks underperformed with over 10% return, according to a report ProShares. Similarly, in the rising interest rates period between this timeframe, dividend growers returned 10.26%, with high dividend stocks returning 9.22%. To learn more about dividend growth stocks, readers should have a look at Dividend Zombies and Kings with Longest Dividend Payouts.\nDividend growth strategies offer potential solutions to the challenges faced by high dividend-paying stocks in a rising-rate environment in two main ways. By prioritizing dividend increases over high yields, dividend growth stocks are less influenced by the value factor, which typically affects high dividend payers. This resilience allows dividend growth stocks to perform better in growth-oriented markets.\nGiven investors\u2019 penchant for dividend-paying companies, businesses worldwide are consistently rewarding shareholders with dividends. According to Janus Henderson, dividends rose by 5% in 2023 to $1.66 trillion, marking the third consecutive year of record highs following a brief dip in payouts during the pandemic in 2020. The fund manager expects total dividends to reach a new peak of $1.72 trillion, reflecting a 3.9% increase on a headline basis. The payments indicate that balance sheets remain strong, despite a global economic downturn and increased costs associated with servicing debt. It also underscores the advantages for the banking sector of higher interest rates. Nearly half of last year\u2019s dividend growth came from banks, which rewarded shareholders after experiencing a significant increase in profits from lending activities.\nOur Methodology:\nFor this list, we used a stock screener to find dividend stocks trading below $25 as of June 21. From the initial list, we selected companies with dividend yields above 2% and a history of regular dividend payments, indicating sustainable dividends. Finally, we narrowed it down to 12 stocks that had the highest number of hedge fund investors, as tracked by Insider Monkey in Q1 2024. Hedge funds aren't dividend investors; they invest in stocks for capital gains. Essentially, our list presents the best dividend stocks under $25 that have the potential to deliver large capital gains. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\nA miner examining yellow gold ore in a mine shaft, symbolizing the company's exploration process.\nBarrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) tops our list of the best dividend stocks under $25. It is one of the largest gold mining companies in the world, headquartered in Canada. The gold prices in the US have been fluctuating over the past month or so as investors await key US inflation data, which could provide new insights into the timing of potential interest rate cuts by the Fed. However, according to analysts, gold prices are expected to rise further, primarily driven by geopolitical tensions and high interest rates, which create a favorable environment for gold mining companies. This is beneficial for companies like Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD), which excel under such conditions.\nWhat makes Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) stand out from other precious metals companies is its emphasis on Tier One mining assets. These mines consistently produce low-cost gold and copper, ensuring profitability even when the prices are low. The company is capable of identifying new Tier One assets and recognizing the potential for existing assets to achieve Tier One status. The strong cash flow from the company's Tier One mines allows the company to offers an appealing base dividend, supplemented by a quarterly performance dividend that varies based on its cash reserves.\nOn May 1, Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share, which was in line with its previous dividend. Earlier this year, the company also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program. As of June 21, the stock has a dividend yield of 2.39%.\nAriel Investments mentioned Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\u201cLastly, gold mining company, Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) fell in the period. Although GOLD delivered in-line earnings results, as higher prices offset lower gold and copper volumes as well as increased costs, investors were disappointed with management\u2019s outlook for full year 2024. GOLD guided to flat production year-over-year driven by lower-than-expected output due to a delayed permit at the Nevada Gold Mines and mechanical issues at Pueblo Viejo. Management remains laser focused on upgrading its mining operations and broadly improving efficiencies amid today\u2019s rising prices for precious metals. The company also continues to prioritize capital returns to shareholders via dividends and a recently announced share repurchase program.\u201d\nBarrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD) remained popular among elite funds at the end of Q1 2024, with hedge fund positions growing to 51, from 43 in the previous quarter, as per Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The collective value of these stakes is roughly $630 million.\nOverall GOLD ranks 1st on our list of the best dividend stocks to buy under $25. You can visit 12 Best Dividend Stocks Under $25 to see the other dividend stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of GOLD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued dividend stock that is more promising than GOLD but that trades at less than 7 times its earnings and yields nearly 10%, check out our report about the dirt cheap dividend stock.",

I'll now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Renaud Adams.\nRenaud Adams: Thank you, Graeme, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Last year, IAMGOLD made significant strides, towards our goal of becoming a leading mid-tier gold producer, leveraging its assets to build a mining platform, with a long-life cornerstone asset in Canada. As we will get into more detail shortly, C\u00f4t\u00e9 Gold saw remarkable progress in 2023, with the project starting the year, with construction approximately 64% complete, but ending the year at 98% complete. This progress included major milestones across the project scope, including the mechanical, piping, electrical, and instrumentation of the plant, completion of the first stage of the tailing facility, electrification of the site to the provincial hydro grid, and initiation, and successful ramp-up of our autonomous mining fleet, making C\u00f4t\u00e9 Gold North America's first gold mine to be designed and built for the usage of autonomous haulage, which is changing the face of mining today.\nC\u00f4t\u00e9 is poised to start production shortly, with more than 5 million tonnes of stockpiling plate, commissioning activities ongoing, and a full hands-off of all primary facets of the project, to the ownership team this quarter. Our primary focus and efforts continue to be on positioning, the project for a steady ramp-up of gold production, through this year, to achieve commercial production in the third quarter. At steady run rate, C\u00f4t\u00e9 Gold will be the third largest gold mine in Canada, and it's critical for the repositioning of IAMGOLD as it runs online. C\u00f4t\u00e9 provides a higher production base, lower cost profile, and a long life of cash flow generation and growth opportunities in Canada. Further, over the last 12 months, the company has seen significant changes in leadership across the organization, with a renewed focus on operational excellence, and accountability while continuing to build on IAMGOLD's strong and widely recognized sustainability practices.\nOperationally, I'm very proud of the team, with a tributary gold production from continuing operations of 465,000 ounces, which was the top end of the guidance range of 410,000 to 470,000. I really want to congratulate the Essakane team who achieved their targets, while facing considerable challenges within the region, and the Westwood team who continues to execute on the plan, to ramp up underground operation while employing industrial-leading underground seismic monitoring and management. Last night, we also announced an update to our year-end, mineral reserves and resources, with a net increase after depletion of Essakane Westwood reserves, extending the mine life of this asset. Mineral resources saw significant increases while driven by updates to C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Gosselin, as we grow our gold pipeline and future for the company.\nLonger term, our goals for IAMGOLD remain, to be a leading intermediate gold producer with a portfolio of assets centered around a corner asset in Canada, that have a proven record and ability to generate strong, consistent free cash flows and attractive returns for shareholders. Build on our pipelines of project and strategic geographies and organically grow our assets. Establish ourselves as a leader amongst peers in health and safety, talent development and ESG, including biodiversity, tailing management, water stewardship, and community health and education. And of course, to be recognized as a leader in applying leading proven technologies that drives performance and sustainability across our business. Financially, we will prioritize returning to the 70% position in C\u00f4t\u00e9 with our partner Sumitomo, as well as use our cash flow to optimize our balance sheet and deliver the company to have a more efficient and balanced capital structure.\nWith that, we will now dive into the operating and financial results and highlights for the quarter. Starting with health and safety, the company continues to perform extremely well with the days away restricted transfer duty rate of 0.39, and total recordable injury rate of 0.69, both based on 200,000-hours work. I want to take a moment, to congratulate Essakane, which achieved its best ever performance in health and safety with a days away restricted transfer duty rate of 0.06. This is a testament to the professionalism and commitment to a culture of safety, for our people in Burkina Faso. Ensuring all of our employees and contractor go home safely would always be the primary focus for IAMGOLD. As we like to say, every gold ounce produced has to be done safely, and our goal continues to be Zero Harm, Zero Harm for the people and the places where we operate.\nOn production, in the fourth quarter, the company produced 136,000 ounces, bringing total annual productions to 465,000 ounces on an attributable basis, which was near the top end of our guidance of 410,000 to 470,000 ounces. As we will get into in a moment, the production results were driven, by Essakane being able to operate, without disruptions and benefiting, from positive grade reconciliation. And the ramp up, in rehabilitation of underground zones at Westwood. Our cash costs and all-in sustaining costs declined in the fourth quarter to $1,197 an ounce and $1,735 an ounce, respectively. This brings our year-to-date cash costs to $1,261 an ounce and an AISC to $1,783 an ounce, in line with our revised guidance estimates this year. On a year-over-year basis, we've seen a step up of cost, due to continued pressures of Essakane, as well as sustained elevated price, from the recent inflationary period.\nWe are seeing some sign of price easing on certain consumables, but on the whole, there are several costs that have a long tail and slow to decline. With that, I will pass the call over to our CFO to walk us through our financial results and position. Maarten?\nMaarten Theunissen: Thank you, Renaud, and good morning, everyone. Looking at our fourth quarter financials, revenues from continuing operations totaled $297.6 million from sales of 147,000 ounces on a 100% basis at an average realized price of $2,005 per ounce. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations was $110 million for the quarter and $315.1 million for the year. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.06 for the quarter and $0.09 for the year. In terms of our financial position, IAMGOLD entered the year with cash and cash equivalents of $367.1 million and a fully undrawn credit facility, equating to the total liquidity of approximately $754 million. As further described in MD&A, the company entered into the one-year extension of its credit facility in November, extending the maturity to January 31, 2026 from January 31, 2025.\nAs part of the extension, the credit facility was also reduced, or right-sized to $425 million, based on the company's requirement for a senior revolving credit facility on its overall business. The extension allows for the credit facility to be available and non-current during 2024, should we require additional liquidity during the ramp-up of C\u00f4t\u00e9 and for working capital purposes. The company has received gross proceeds of $197.6 million from the Bambouk transactions and the remaining transactions related to the sale of the early-stage assets in Guinea and Mali, are expected to close this year for gross proceeds of approximately $84.4 million. We note that within cash and cash equivalents, $81.7 million was held by C\u00f4t\u00e9 Gold and $70.9 million was held by Essakane.\nThe C\u00f4t\u00e9 Gold UJV requires its joint venture partners to fund, in advance, two months of future expenditures and cash calls are made at the beginning of each month, resulting in a month-end cash balance approximating the following month's expenditure. Essakane normally pays a dividend in the second half of the year. As we will outline in a moment, the company's remaining funding requirement, to complete construction and commissioning of C\u00f4t\u00e9 Gold to bring the mine to first gold is estimated to be $142 million, which includes working capital adjustments. The company believes that its available liquidity at December 31, 2023, combined with cash flows from operations, the expected proceeds from the sale of the remaining Bambouk assets, and available liquidity provided by the credit facility, is sufficient for the company to fund its $60.3 million interest of the C\u00f4t\u00e9 an incorporated joint venture, to complete the construction and commissioning, and ramp-up of the C\u00f4t\u00e9 Gold project.\nIt should be noted that the company's ability to draw on the credit facility, is impacted by certain covenants, including the net debt to EBITDA and interest coverage ratios, of the company that could be impacted, by macroeconomic factors and the performance of the company's existing operations. We also announced amendments to our Gold prepay commitments in December. We entered into a new forward sale announcement and a partial amendment to one of our existing Gold prepay arrangements that effectively transfers the Gold delivery obligations out of the first quarter of this year into the first quarter of next year. This was an important measure to improve the financial flexibility for the company for a reasonable cost, while we were also able to benefit from - forward gold prices, particularly for the first quarter of this year while we are commissioning C\u00f4t\u00e9 head of production by the end of the quarter.\nAnd with that, I will pass back to Renaud. Thank you, Renaud.\nRenaud Adams: Thanks, Maarten. Turning now to Essakane, the mine reported attributable gold production of 108,000 ounces in the fourth quarter, which was the highest quarter of production for the year, bringing total attributable productions in 2023 to 372,000 ounces. Mining activities totaled 12.9 million tonnes in a quarter, an increase from the third quarter as operations were less impacted by the security situation within the country, with minimal disruptions in fuel supply. On an annual basis, mining operation moved 43 million tonnes, 13% lower than the prior year, due to the impacts to the supply chain in the first and third quarters. And on ore tonnes mined of 9.6 million tonnes, we are approximately 24% less than the year prior as a result of an increase in required waste stripping as mining activities moved into Phase 5, 6, and 7 of the bit in the second half of the year in support of the '24 and 2025 mine plan.\nHead grades increased in the quarter to 1.32 grams a tonne, due to positive reconciliations, for the deeper benches of Phase 5. This positive grade reconciliation at Essakane is a trend that has continued in the early weeks of this year. However, head grades are still expected, to decline in line with the recent life of mine plan, as volume from Phases 6 and 7 increase, and from increased proportion of stockpiles ore. On a cost basis, Essakane reported fourth quarter cash costs of $1,132 per pound and an all-in sustaining cost to $1,548 an ounce, a significant improvement from the prior quarter, yet year-over-year, the cost profile has increased with 2023 annual cash costs of $1,181 per ounce and an AISC of $1,521 an ounce. This increase in Essakane cost profile, over the last 12 to 18 months, is attributed to a combination of the lagging impact on deflation, higher volumes of operating waste from increased strip ratios, as the mine enters new phases, the impact of security situation resulting in higher land and fuel prices, transportation and camp costs, as well as higher labor costs, due to appreciation in the local currency.\nIn addition, last year, we saw the government of Burkina Faso implement an updated royalty rate that we sell the in-country legal proceedings on the 2018 handling of carbon fine. Looking ahead, Essakane is expected to produce 330,000 to 370,000 ounces at a cash cost of $1,300 to $1,400 an ounce and an AISC of $1,675 and $1,800 per ounce. These metrics are in line with the updated 43-101 and life of mine plan we announced for Essakane in December. Under the current mine plan, 2024 represents the last year of significant sustaining capital, which is expected to decline notably in the later years of the mine plan, assuming no further extension of mine life. The updated technical report, we released in December demonstrated, the successes of teams have had delineating additional ounces - within the site security parameters, which contributed to an increase in our mineral reserve and resources inventory and more than offset mine production depletions in 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2023, Essakane has proven and probable reserve of 2.2 million ounces at an average grade of 1.1 gram per tonne, of which open pit reserve were estimated to be 1.8 million ounces, rating 132 grams a tonne. As a result, we were able to extend the mine life of Essakane an additional year, providing visibility for the next five years of operations, at the project with considerable cash flow generating potential, particularly as stripping requirements decline in the later years. We continue to seek opportunities, for further extension of the mine - the life of mine as we continue to advance in 2024. Turning to Westwood, the fourth quarter represented the highest quarter of gold production since the mine restarted in 2021, with 28,000 ounces of gold produced, bringing the total annual production last year to 93,000 ounces.\nThe higher production in fourth quarter is the result of the ramp up of underground operations, supplying increased volumes of higher grade ore for the mill feed and the introductions of higher grade material from the Fayolle deposit. Ore mined from underground totals 77,000 tonnes in the fourth quarter, contributing to an average head grade from underground ore of 7.92 grams a tonne, which is the highest grade from underground in nearly six years since Q1, 2018. As rehabilitation efforts have allowed access to previously closed higher grade underground stopes. The mill throughput in the first quarter - for the fourth quarter 2023 was 245,000 tonnes at an average head grade of - 2.9 grams a tonne. The mill availability in the fourth quarter was rather low at 78%, which compared with 95% in the prior year period.\nThis was due to unplanned maintenance of the SAG mill liners and apron feeder. The cost profile for Westwood continues to see improvement with the increase in production. Cash costs averaged $1,434 an ounce in the fourth quarter, which was also a record since the restart of operation, and notably includes an estimated $190 an ounce of cost related to the development incurred at Fayolle that was expanded, due to the short life of mining of the deposit. On an all-in sustaining cost basis, Westwood averaged an AISC of $2,049 an ounce in Q4, which compared well with the realized gold price of $1,989 an ounce. Further, when adjusted for positive working capital movement, Westwood actually returned positive mine site free cash in the fourth quarter, an important step in its return to profitability.\nLooking ahead to this year, Westwood gold production is expected to be in the range of 100,000 to 120,000 ounces in '24, with an increasing proportion of ore sourced from the underground mine at higher grades. Production levels are expected to be higher in the first half of '24, due to mine sequencing in the underground mine, as the supplementary mill feed from Fayolle, is replaced with lower grade material from Grand Duc in the second half of the year. Cash costs at Westwood, are expected in the range of $1,250 to $1,375 per ounce sold, and the AISC per ounce sold, are expected in the range of $1,800 to $2,000, with a decrease driven, by the expected increase in production, and reduced underground rehabilitation. Sustaining capital expenditure this year are expected to be essentially flat year-over-year at approximately $65 million, as lower rehabilitation is offset, with increased underground development, as well as an increase in capital, for the renewal of the mobile fleet and fixed equipment.\nLooking at the long section of the mine here on the right, we can see the increase in underground mining activity in the Central and West corridors, regions of the mine, which were essentially shut down prior to the rehabilitation program of the last two years. We currently have eight zones, but a total of 10 zones that we are targeting in 2024, utilizing a revised mining method of pillarless pyramid stope sequencing to deflect the seismic stresses to the outside of the operating areas. Since the reopening of the mine in 2021, we have now proven that we can mine in these higher grade zones, resulting in meaningful changes to Westwood's complex inventory. Westwood Mineral Reserves, including the Grand Duc open pit, increased 109% from 582,000 ounces to 1.2 million ounces, net of depletion, with grades increasing 26% to 7.14 grams a tonne gold.\nExcluding Grand Duc, underground mineral reserves were estimated at 1.1 million ounces at an average grade of 10.6 grams a tonne gold. In the second half of the year, IAMGOLD plans to file an updated NI 43-101 technical report, detailing the results of ongoing mine optimization efforts and strategic assessment of the Westwood complex. Turning to C\u00f4t\u00e9 Gold, the project saw remarkable progress last year. Though, when you look at these pictures, you may not see significant visual change from last quarter, aside from the snow cover. As at the end of the third quarter, all major infrastructure was in place, and the focus was shifting to completion of piping, electrical, and instrumentation, as well as demobilizing certain contractors and ramping up pre-commissioning and commissioning activity.\nWith first gold on the horizon, we're now executing and ramping up commissioning activities, methodically working through the flow shift starting on the dry side before bringing it together with the wet circuits. Looking at the pictures, starting at the top left, is a view of the processing facilities, with four primary structures in yellow of note. The first is the primary crusher in the foreground, which you can also see and the photo beside the facilities photo in the top middle. This was commissioned in mid-January, where mines rock were delivered to the crusher via autonomous haul trucks. The crush material was then conveyed and screened for size through the screening building, which is the facility's photo in the building in the upper left of the picture and located between the wet processing building and the domes, before being conveyed and deposited in the Coarse Ore Dome, which you can see in the top right of the page.\nWe are now working on commissioning of the secondary crushing building, which comes in the HPGR seen in the bottom left. From there, the crushed ore is conveyed back and forth from the screening building before being deposited in the fine ore bin, which is the white silo you can see beside the secondary crushing building seen in the upper left picture. This step would account for a total of three of the four buildings and all conveyors having been commissioned. After this, the fine ore is conveyed into the processing plant, where it passes into the ball mill in the bottom center photo, and then through the remaining circuits of the plant, which is termed as the wet zone. As far as other progress of note, as I mentioned, we are nearing a major milestone with the full hand-off of all facets of the project to the ownership team.\nMining activities, which started with the first autonomous truck over a year ago, progressed very well over the year, with now over 5 million tonnes of stockpile available and in place. Final deliverables include the back end of the plant, where final mechanical completion of the detox and electrowinning circuit is nearing completion. Taken together, we are ready and very excited to turn the chapter on C\u00f4t\u00e9 and bring it online for the benefit of our shareholders. Maarten, you can walk us through the remaining project expenditure please, and capital outlook for the year..\nMaarten Theunissen: Thank you, Renaud. Since commencement of construction and up to December 31, 2023, on a 100% basis, the C\u00f4t\u00e9 project has incurred $2.786 billion of the planned $2.96 billion of project expenditures. The remaining expenditures to achieve first gold is estimated, to be $179 million for the project as a whole at 100%, which will bring the total cost to first gold in line with the $2.96 billion estimate. There is an estimated $40 million of expenditures that will be incurred post the first gold date for additional required infrastructure and earthwork projects. Our remaining funding obligation for the project expenditure up to first gold, based on our 60.3% interest and incorporating changes of working capital, leases and adjustment to the cash balance held by the UJV is $142 million, which, as I noted earlier, can be funded with the $367 million of cash on our balance sheet, as well as operating cash flows, and other sources of liquidity we discussed earlier.\nTurning to the high-level outlook for C\u00f4t\u00e9, and everything I will be quoting here, is on a 100% basis, I will draw your attention to the top right, where we outlined an expectation for capital expenditures this year, in addition to the construction-related expenditures we just highlighted. We estimate that $40 million of operating expenditures relating to milling, surface cost, administration, and indirect costs that will be incurred during commissioning, ramp-up and up to commercial production, will be capitalized and reported as capital expenditure. These costs represents, the inefficiencies experienced while the project is ramping up and not operating at design capacity, while the operational team has been fully hired. The estimated capital expenditures related, to operations for 2024, excluding capital waste stripping, totaled $145 million.\nThese expenditures will be incurred through the year and include $60 million for the expansion of the next stage of the tailings management facility, $50 million for equipment purchases, including additional haulage trucks, drills and other mobile equipment, and $35 million related to other owners' cost capital projects. Then finally, we estimate $50 million to be incurred for capitalized waste stripping. It is worth highlighting that C\u00f4t\u00e9 capital's expenditures in 2024, are expected to be higher than the life of mine average, as the mine progresses with the completion of the construction of the full tailings dam footprint and increases volume of material mined. Over to you, Renaud.\nRenaud Adams: Thank you again, Maarten. Production at C\u00f4t\u00e9 Gold on a 100% basis is expected to be between 220,000 and 290,000 ounces in 2024. This estimate assumes that following initial gold productions in late Q1, but the operations ramp up in the second quarter 2024 and commercial productions is achieved in the third quarter of 2024. The company defines commercial production as an average throughput of the mill of 60% over a period of 30 days. We are targeting C\u00f4t\u00e9 to exit the year at a throughput rate of approximately 90% of the nameplate. During the ramp-up of the project and until commercial production is achieved, it is rather difficult to provide a good indication of operating cost estimates. But as C\u00f4t\u00e9 Gold achieves 90% throughput exiting the year, we estimate cash costs at the time to be in the range of approximately $700 to $800 an ounce and an AISC of $1,100 to $1,200 an ounce sold.\nWith further decreases, as volumes increased and as we move through the lagging impact of the recent deflations on contracts for consumables. This brings us to what is the future of C\u00f4t\u00e9. We announce an updated mineral resource and reserve estimate for C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Gosselin last night that some material increases in inventory at both of these deposits. At C\u00f4t\u00e9, mineral reserve on a 100% basis increased by 436,000 ounces to 7.6 million ounces with grades increasing 5% to 1.01 grams per tonne gold. The increase in ounces was primarily driven by the increased grade of proven mineral reserve to 1.09 grams per tonne gold based on the increase in stockpiled inventory and the ongoing grade control drilling program. On a resource basis, C\u00f4t\u00e9 Gold measured and indicated mineral resources increased 1.9 million ounces or 18% to 12.1 million ounces of gold.\nAt Gosselin, the drilling completed since the maiden resources, has been extremely effective, with an updated mineral resource estimate on a 100% basis of 4.4 million indicated gold ounces and 3 million inferred ounces. This represents an estimated increase of 1.1 million ounces in indicated and 1.3 million ounces in inferred, representing a 32% and 74% increase respectively. This expansion of the Gosselin resource was the result of a 35,000 meter drill program completed over the last two years. This year, we are planning an additional 35,000 meter targeting the Central zone between the pit shells where we see indication of continuation of mineralization and hydrothermal breaches, as well as some deeper holes to understand the continuity of mineralizations below the current pit shells.\nThe updated resource at Gosselin is very exciting for the project. Gosselin is a very large scale deposit sitting immediately adjacent to C\u00f4t\u00e9. That when combined together have an estimated total measured and indicated mineral resources of 16.5 million ounces, with an additional 4.2 million ounces of inferred, putting the project in exclusive company of large-scale Canadian assets. The August 2022 Life of Mine plan model, was built on mineable reserve of 230 million tonnes of material for just over 7 million ounces. However, when investors considered a combined global resource inventory of the C\u00f4t\u00e9 Gold project, with its size and scope and for a mine that is effectively built, this is a very compelling potential offer for our shareholders.\nAs I've said before, C\u00f4t\u00e9 Gold today is a project, but we believe strongly that this is the start of a mining camp and that it will provide a strong foundation for IAMGOLD for many years to come. With that, I would like to pass the call back to the operator for the Q&A.\nSee also 17 Fastest growing B2B SaaS Companies and 16 Best Beach Towns to Buy a House/Apartment in USA.\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.",

As a continuation of these efforts, it is pleasing to share that since the reporting period, the Company has signed a $500 million copper prepay arrangement at competitive terms with Jiangxi Copper. This arrangement is a reminder of the strategic nature of copper as supply challenges abound across the sector. Constructive discussions with our lenders for an amendment and extension of our loan facilities, which are an important component to our fulsome solution, are well-advanced and there is a high degree of alignment among all parties. We continue with sales processes for some of our smaller assets and minority stake sales in our larger assets, with strong interest from highly credible counterparties for both,\u201d commented Tristan Pascall, Chief Executive Officer of First Quantum. \"In Zambia, we continue to be confident in the investment climate in the country and, as such, we remain committed to our investment in the S3 Expansion, which is expected to generate significant free cash flow once operational in the second half of 2025. At Cobre Panam\u00e1, the blockades around the mine have dissipated, allowing for critical supply deliveries by port and by road. We continue to work closely with local authorities in order to ship the concentrate stockpile from the site, which is required to fund critical environmental work. We remain focused on the preservation, safe and responsible stewardship of Cobre Panam\u00e1. Finally, I would like to thank everybody at First Quantum for their continued perseverance and hard work in these challenging times.\"\nQ4 2023 SUMMARY\nIn Q4 2023, First Quantum reported gross profit of $87 million, EBITDA1 of $273 million, a net loss attributable to shareholders of $2.09 per share, and an adjusted loss per share2 of $0.37. Relative to the third quarter of 2023 (\u201cQ3 2023\u201d), fourth quarter financial results were negatively impacted by the disruptions experienced at the Cobre Panam\u00e1 mine which led to the mine being placed in a phase of Preservation and Safe Management (\"P&SM\"). In addition, disruptions at the mine's port prevented the shipment of concentrates since the beginning of November last year.\nTotal copper production for the fourth quarter was 160,200 tonnes, a 28% decrease from Q3 2023. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in production was attributable to lower production at all three of the Company's main operations, mainly Cobre Panam\u00e1. Copper C1 cash cost2 of $1.82 per lb for Q4 2023 was $0.40 per lb higher than in Q3 2023 due to lower production and higher electricity costs at the Zambian operations following the signing of the new ZESCO agreement, mitigated by lower maintenance costs.\nThree-year guidance on production, copper C1 cash costs1, copper all-in sustaining costs (\"AISC\")1 and capital expenditures that were previously disclosed on January 15, 2024 remain unchanged and exclude Cobre Panam\u00e1. For 2024, copper production is forecast to be 370,000 to 420,000 tonnes while copper C1 cash costs1 are guided to be $1.80 to $2.05 per lb. Capital cost guidance for 2024 is expected to be between $1,250 million and $1,400 million.\n____________________________________\n1 EBITDA and adjusted earnings (loss) are non-GAAP financial measures.

See \u201cRegulatory Disclosures\u201d.\nQ4 2023 OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS\nTotal copper production for the fourth quarter was 160,200 tonnes, a 28% decrease from Q3 2023. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in production was impacted by the ramp down in operations at Cobre Panam\u00e1 to a phase of P&SM due to illegal blockades around the mine site while lower production at Kansanshi and Sentinel also contributed to the decline. Copper sales volumes in Q4 2023 totaled 127,721 tonnes, approximately 32,479 tonnes lower than production, mainly due to port disruptions at Cobre Panam\u00e1 that prevented the shipment of copper concentrates.\n-\nCobre Panam\u00e1 produced 62,616 tonnes of copper in Q4 2023, a decrease of 50,118 tonnes from the previous quarter as production was suspended at the end of November 2023 due to illegal blockades at the Punta Rinc\u00f3n port and at the roads to the site that prevented the delivery of supplies that were necessary to operate the power plant. Prior to the disruptions from the illegal blockades, Cobre Panam\u00e1 operated at an annualized throughput rate of 93 million tonnes for the month of October. This, combined with higher grades and improving recoveries, allowed the operation to achieve monthly record production of 41,543 tonnes. Copper production for the full year 2023 was 330,863 tonnes, down from 350,438 tonnes in 2022. Copper C1 cash cost1 of $1.45 per lb was $0.26 per lb higher than the previous quarter due to lower copper production volumes and lower gold by-product credits. 2024 production guidance for Cobre Panam\u00e1 has been suspended as the site currently remains in a phase of P&SM. At the request of the Ministry of Commerce and Industries (\"MICI\"), Cobre Panam\u00e1 delivered a preliminary draft for the first phase of P&SM on January 16, 2024. Previous illegal blockages around the mine have dissipated, allowing for the delivery by road and at port of necessary supplies to conduct the P&SM program. The associated costs for the program are estimated at $15 to $20 million per month and further reductions could follow depending on environmental stewardship programs. Approximately 121 thousand dry metric tonnes of copper concentrate remains onsite following disruptions at the Punta Rinc\u00f3n port. The sale of this concentrate will result in a net cash inflow of approximately $225 million at current market prices.\n-\nKansanshi\u2019s copper production of 31,887 tonnes in Q4 2023 was 7,713 tonnes lower than the previous quarter as a result of lower throughput, grades and recoveries across all three circuits. Lower throughput was primarily due to mining constraints in M17 resulting in slower mining rates and the stockpiling of material from M15 and M17 due to acid volume restrictions. Kansanshi's production for 2023 of 134,827 tonnes was within the revised guidance range of 130,000 to 140,000 tonnes. Copper C1 cash cost1 of $2.43 per lb was $0.80 higher than Q3 2023 mainly due to lower copper production volumes. Production guidance for 2024 is expected to be 130,000 to 150,000 tonnes of copper and 65,000 to 75,000 ounces of gold.\n-\nSentinel reported copper production of 59,964 tonnes in Q4 2023, 3,841 tonnes lower than the previous quarter mainly due to lower throughput as production continued to be impacted by the mining of very hard rock from the lower levels in Stages 1 and 2 of the open pit. Mining productivity, however, continued to improve during the quarter with improved blast fragmentation and reduced congestion with the commencement of the Stage 3 (Western Cut-back) mining. Sentinel copper production for 2023 of 214,046 tonnes was lower than the revised guidance range of 220,000 to 230,000 tonnes. Copper C1 cash cost1 of $1.85 per lb was $0.20 per lb higher than the preceding quarter, reflecting higher electricity prices. Copper production guidance for 2024 is 220,000 to 250,000 tonnes. The major focus for 2024 at Sentinel will be on the development of Stage 3 (Western Cut-back) in order to enable improved mining productivities and increased availability of softer material from higher elevations. The wet weather preparations and improved storm water management processes have been implemented to mitigate the risk of water accumulation as experienced in previous raining seasons.\n-\nEnterprise produced 2,751 tonnes of nickel during the fourth quarter, an increase from 1,556 tonnes in Q3 2023 as the operation continues to ramp up. Production guidance in 2024 for Enterprise is 10,000 to 20,000 contained tonnes of nickel. Commercial production and full plant throughput is expected in 2024.\n-\nAt Ravensthorpe, as previously announced, a decision was made subsequent to the year-end to scale back mining operations and associated processing activities as a result of continued low nickel prices. A new operating plan has been developed under which Ravensthorpe aims to maintain production from ore stockpiles and suspend mining from the Shoemaker Levy ore body. The high-pressure acid leach circuit will also be bypassed and ore will be exclusively processed through the atmospheric leach circuits. Production from existing ore stockpiles is expected for 18 months after which time, mining at Hale Bopp and Halley\u2019s ore bodies is expected to commence.\n____________________________________\n1 Copper C1 cash costs (C1), and copper all-in sustaining costs (AISC) are non-GAAP ratio which does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and might not be comparable to similar financial measures disclosed by other issuers. See \u201cRegulatory Disclosures\u201d.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nCompared to Q3 2023, fourth quarter financial results were considerably weaker due to the suspension of production at the Cobre Panam\u00e1 mine at the end of November 2023 when the mine was placed in P&SM. Financial results were also impacted by approximately 121 thousand dry metric tonnes of copper concentrate that remains unsold from Cobre Panam\u00e1 as a result of the disruptions at the Punta Rinc\u00f3n port. An impairment charge of $900 million was recognized which includes $854 million at Ravensthorpe as a result of significant margin pressure due to weak nickel prices, lower payabilities and high operating costs. Impairment expenses also include $46 million in respect of exploration assets.\nThe Company's total and net debt1 increased during the fourth quarter due to a one-time payment of $567 million to the Government of Panama on November 16, 2023 in respect to taxes and royalties for the period from December 2021 to October 2023.\n-\nGross profit for the fourth quarter of $87 million was 87% lower than in Q3 2023, while EBITDA1 of $273 million for the same period was 72% lower.\n-\nCash flows used by operating activities of $185 million ($0.27 per share2) for the quarter were $779 million lower than Q3 2023.\n-\nNet debt1 increased by $783 million during the quarter, taking the net debt1 balance to $6,420 million as at December 31, 2023. As at December 31, 2023, total debt was $7,379 million (total debt was $6,892 million at September 30, 2023).\n-\nAn interim dividend of CDN$0.08 per share, in respect of the financial year ended December 31, 2023 was paid on September 19, 2023 to shareholders of record on August 28, 2023. On January 15, 2024, the Company announced that it has suspended its dividend as a result of Cobre Panam\u00e1 being in a phase of P&SM.\nThe current situation at Cobre Panam\u00e1 has impacted the EBITDA1 generating potential of the Company, putting at risk the Company\u2019s ability to meet the net debt1 to EBITDA1 ratio covenant as defined in its current senior banking facilities. Current forecasts for 2024, before taking into account future balance sheet initiatives, indicate the Company may breach the prevailing net debt1 to EBITDA1 ratio covenant during the coming twelve months, and failure to address this would result in the existence of a material uncertainty that may cast a significant doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, disclosure of this material uncertainty has been made in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nManagement has a strong expectation that the balance sheet initiatives initiated earlier this year will be realized in the near term. The disclosure of material uncertainty does not include potential changes in the Company's covenants, which are materially advanced in discussions with the Company's banking partners nor the financing initiatives described in more detail below, which would significantly reduce the risk of breaching covenants if realized.\n____________________________________\n1 EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measures and net debt is a supplementary financial measure.

See \u201cRegulatory Disclosures\u201d.\nBALANCE SHEET INITIATIVES\nWith Cobre Panam\u00e1 in a phase of P&SM, the Company is employing a number of measures to prudently allow for the planned capital spending elsewhere across First Quantum\u2019s business, most notably the S3 Expansion at Kansanshi, which will further strengthen cash flows when it is commissioned in 2025. The Company is advancing several initiatives in 2024 to give optionality and flexibility:\n-\nCopper prepayment agreement (\"Prepayment Agreement\"): After the reporting period, the Company signed a $500 million 3-year Prepayment Agreement with Jiangxi Copper at competitive rates. The agreement provides for the delivery of 50kt of copper anode per annum from Kansanshi payable at market prices. The prepaid amount will reduce in line with deliveries over the second and third years of the Prepayment Agreement. Proceeds will be used towards general corporate purposes and to increase liquidity.\n-\nDividend suspension: On January 15, 2024, the Board suspended the semi-annual dividend. The Board will review the Company\u2019s financial policy on an ongoing basis and adjust the dividend approach when appropriate.\n-\nCapital expenditure reductions: Planned capital programs across the Company were reduced or re-phased by approximately $400 million in 2024 and $250 million in 2025. The Company remains committed to delivering the S3 Expansion project at Kansanshi in 2025.\n-\nOperating costs and other reductions: Following a detailed review of all operating and administrative costs, the Company has identified savings which will offset recent inflationary pressures. The cost savings initiatives include a change in strategy at Ravensthorpe to temporarily remove higher cost production.\n-\nWorking capital: The Company is also targeting reductions in working capital requirements and savings in the procurement of materials, supplies and third party service costs where possible.\n-\nAssets and stake sales: A sales process for the Las Cruces mine in Spain is well-advanced with strong interest given the strategic location and processing capabilities of the project. Following a number of inbound expressions of interest, the Company is evaluating the possibility of a minority investment by strategic investors in the Company's Zambian business.\n-\nFinancing activity: The Company continues to take a proactive approach to managing its balance sheet and the refinancing of its near-term debt maturities. An ongoing process between the Company and its banking partners is materially advanced, with a high degree of alignment regarding amendment and extension. A conclusion on these amendments is expected in the near term. The Company is also assessing a range of alternatives across the capital markets to maintain a robust financial position and preserve value for its shareholders.\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n|\n| QUARTERLY | FULL YEAR | |||||||||||||\n|\n| Q4 2023 |\n| Q3 2023 |\n| Q4 2022 |\n|\n| 2023 |\n|\n| 2022 |\n| |||\n| Sales revenues |\n| 1,218 |\n|\n| 2,029 |\n|\n| 1,832 |\n|\n| 6,456 |\n|\n| 7,626 |\n|\n| Gross profit |\n| 87 |\n|\n| 660 |\n|\n| 361 |\n|\n| 1,292 |\n|\n| 2,200 |\n|\n| Net earnings (loss) attributable to shareholders of the Company |\n| (1,447 | ) |\n| 325 |\n|\n| 117 |\n|\n| (954 | ) |\n| 1,034 |\n|\n| Basic earnings (loss) per share | ($2.09 | ) | $0.47 |\n| $0.17 |\n| ($1.38 | ) | $1.50 |\n| |||||\n| Diluted earnings (loss) per share | ($2.09 | ) | $0.47 |\n| $0.17 |\n| ($1.38 | ) | $1.49 |\n| |||||\n| Cash flows from (used by) operating activities3 |\n| (185 | ) |\n| 594 |\n|\n| 237 |\n|\n| 1,427 |\n|\n| 2,332 |\n|\n| Net debt1 |\n| 6,420 |\n|\n| 5,637 |\n|\n| 5,692 |\n|\n| 6,420 |\n|\n| 5,692 |\n|\n| EBITDA1,2 |\n| 273 |\n|\n| 969 |\n|\n| 647 |\n|\n| 2,328 |\n|\n| 3,316 |\n|\n| Adjusted earnings (loss)1 |\n| (259 | ) |\n| 359 |\n|\n| 151 |\n|\n| 261 |\n|\n| 1,064 |\n|\n| Adjusted earnings (loss) per share3 | ($0.37 | ) | $0.52 |\n| $0.22 |\n| $0.38 |\n| $1.54 |\n| |||||\n| Realized copper price (per lb)3 | $3.62 |\n| $3.70 |\n| $3.56 |\n| $3.76 |\n| $3.90 |\n| |||||\n| Net earnings (loss) attributable to shareholders of the Company |\n| (1,447 | ) |\n| 325 |\n|\n| 117 |\n|\n| (954 | ) |\n| 1,034 |\n|\n| Adjustments attributable to shareholders of the Company: |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| ||||||||||\n| Adjustment for expected phasing of Zambian value-added tax (\u201cVAT\u201d) receipts |\n| 20 |\n|\n| (15 | ) |\n| 56 |\n|\n| (49 | ) |\n| 190 |\n|\n| Ravensthorpe deferred tax charge |\n| 160 |\n|\n| \u2013 |\n|\n| \u2013 |\n|\n| 160 |\n|\n| \u2013 |\n|\n| Total adjustments to EBITDA1 excluding depreciation2 |\n| 1,031 |\n|\n| 61 |\n|\n| 6 |\n|\n| 1,129 |\n|\n| (155 | ) |\n| Tax adjustments |\n| 273 |\n|\n| (12 | ) |\n| (22 | ) |\n| 271 |\n|\n| (7 | ) |\n| Minority interest adjustments |\n| (296 | ) |\n| \u2013 |\n|\n| (6 | ) |\n| (296 | ) |\n| 2 |\n|\n| Adjusted earnings (loss)1 |\n| (259 | ) |\n| 359 |\n|\n| 151 |\n|\n| 261 |\n|\n| 1,064 |\n|\n| 1 EBITDA and adjusted earnings (loss) are non-GAAP financial measures, and net debt is a supplementary financial measure.

Guidance involves estimates of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause the actual results to be materially different.\nProduction, cash cost and capital expenditure guidance for 2024 to 2026 remain unchanged from the News Release \"First Quantum Minerals Announces 2023 Preliminary Production, 2024-2026 Guidance and Balance Sheet Initiatives\" dated January 15, 2024 and is presented excluding Cobre Panam\u00e1 as the mine remains in a phase of P&SM with production halted. The associated funding of P&SM is expected to range from $15 to $20 million per month and further reductions could follow depending on environmental stewardship programs.\n2024 Copper production guidance is between 370,000 to 420,000 tonnes and is expected to increase to between 400,000 to 460,000 tonnes in 2025 and 2026 as the S3 Expansion at Kansanshi comes online. For 2024, copper C1 cash costs1 are guided to be $1.80 to $2.05 per lb. Total copper C1 cash costs1 and copper AISC1 unit cost ranges are in line with prior year guidance when excluding Cobre Panam\u00e1. Improvements in operating costs such as fuel, maintenance, contractors and labour mitigated the impact of lower by-product credits from Kansanshi and lower production at Sentinel.\nCapital expenditure continues to experience inflationary cost increases driven by higher shipping rates, steel prices, power costs, labour rates and general inflation. Guidance reflects these cost increases as well as additional scope increases and the timing of expenditures, including approximately $235 million of expenditure carried over from 2023. However, strategic measures have been implemented to offset the impact of these inflationary increases and deferred expenditure through optimizing and prioritizing capital expenditure.\nTotal capital expenditure for the S3 Expansion project remains unchanged at $1.25 billion, with approximately $215 million spent to date. The S3 Expansion includes the development and construction of the S3 process plant circuit and mining fleet acquisitions. Across the three-year guidance period, capital expenditure for the S3 Expansion project is expected to be approximately $780 million with the majority of the spend planned over 2024 and 2025. Pre-strip activities for the South East Dome pit are expected to continue through 2025, of which $220 million is included in the S3 project capital within the guidance period. First production from S3 continues to be expected in H2 2025.\nInterest expense on debt for the full year 2024 is expected to be approximately $610 - $630 million and excludes interest accrued on related party loans to Cobre Panam\u00e1 and Ravensthorpe, a finance cost accreted on the precious metal streaming arrangement, capitalized interest expense and accretion on asset retirement obligation.\nCash outflow on interest paid is expected to be approximately $555 - $575 million for the full year 2024. This figure excludes interest paid on related party loans to Cobre Panam\u00e1 and Ravensthorpe and capitalized interest paid.\nCapitalized interest is expected to be approximately $55 million for the full year 2024.\nThe effective tax rate for 2024 excluding Cobre Panam\u00e1 and interest expense is expected to be approximately 30%.\nThe full year 2024 depreciation expense excluding Cobre Panam\u00e1 is expected to be between $630 to $660 million. Whilst under P&SM, depreciation at Cobre Panam\u00e1 is expected to be $90 million to $120 million on an annualized basis.\n____________________________________\n1 Realized metal price, C1 cash cost (C1), and All-in sustaining cost (AISC) are non-GAAP ratio which does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and might not be comparable to similar financial measures disclosed by other issuers.

See \u201cRegulatory Disclosures\u201d. | ||||||\n|\n|\nCOBRE PANAM\u00c1 UPDATE\nCobre Panam\u00e1 remains in a phase of P&SM with production halted. Approximately 1,400 workers remain on site to run the P&SM program. Further reductions to a headcount below 1,000 workers may follow depending on environmental stewardship programs. Previous illegal blockages around the mine have dissipated, allowing for the delivery by road and at port of necessary supplies to conduct the P&SM program.\nOn June 26, 2023, the Company and the GOP signed the Refreshed Concession Contract and it was subsequently countersigned by the National Comptroller of Panama. The Refreshed Concession Contract was presented before the Commerce Committee of the National Assembly of Panama, that recommended the amendment of certain terms of the contract.\nOn October 17, 2023, the Refreshed Concession Contract, with amended terms, was resubmitted to and approved by the Commerce Committee of the National Assembly of Panama. On October 20, 2023, the National Assembly in Panama passed Bill 1100 for the approval of the Refreshed Concession Contract for the Cobre Panam\u00e1 mine. On the same day, the President of Panama sanctioned Bill 1100 into Law 406 that was subsequently published in the Official Gazette.\nOn November 16, 2023, in accordance with its contractual obligations to the Republic of Panama under Law 406, the Company made tax and royalty payments of $567 million in respect of the period from December 2021 to October 2023.\nOn November 28, 2023, the Supreme Court of Justice of Panama declared Law 406 unconstitutional and stating the effect of the ruling is that the Refreshed Concession Contract no longer exists. The Supreme Court did not order the closure of the Cobre Panam\u00e1 mine. The ruling of the Supreme Court was subsequently published in the Official Gazette on December 2, 2023.\nOn December 19, 2023, the Minister for Panama\u2019s MICI announced plans for Cobre Panam\u00e1 following the ruling of the Supreme Court. The validity of Panama\u2019s mineral resource code which was established more than 50 years ago was reiterated by the Minister given the absence of retroactivity of the Supreme Court ruling. As part of these plans, a temporary phase of environmental Preservation and Safe Management would be established until June 2024, during which intervening period independent audits, review and planning activities would be undertaken. It was stated that Panama would be the first country in the world to implement a sudden mine closure of this magnitude, and therefore the planning is estimated by the GOP to take up to two years, and 10 years or more to implement. The Minister also announced plans to consider the economic impacts of the halt to operations of Cobre Panam\u00e1 at both a national and local level. The Company is of the view, supported by the advice of legal counsel, that it has acquired rights with respect to the operation of the Cobre Panam\u00e1 project, as well as rights under international law.\nIn January 2024, the Company and MICI had discussions related to a formalized P&SM program and the associated costs for Cobre Panam\u00e1. Additionally, the Company hosted a large delegation from MICI and the Ministry of the Environment, as well as other government departments and a broad range of civil society organizations to demonstrate the measures that are being undertaken as part of the P&SM program. At the request of MICI, Cobre Panam\u00e1 delivered a preliminary draft for the first phase of P&SM on January 16, 2024.\nPresidential and national legislative elections will take place in May 2024, with a new president, GOP cabinet and National Assembly assuming office in July 2024.\nThe Company has commenced international arbitration processes including notification under the Free Trade Agreement (\u201cFTA\u201d) between Canada and Panama, and under the International Court of Arbitration relating to concession agreement. The FTA provides for, among other things, arbitration before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, which is seated in Washington, D.C.\nBROWNFIELD PROJECTS\nAt the S3 Expansion, the majority of the capital spend is expected to occur in 2024. Detailed design is largely complete. Earthworks and civil works continue to progress and the project remains on track to come online during the second half of 2025. The first 11 ultra-class trucks and first shovel are commissioned and are in service on site.\nEarthworks and civil works continued to progress and project procurement was approximately 70% committed at the end of the quarter. Deliveries of major long lead equipment such as mills, primary crusher and thickeners commenced in the third quarter of 2023 and will continue through to the second quarter of 2024. Construction continues across all disciplines and excavation of the primary crusher position commenced during the quarter.\nAt Enterprise, all major mining and plant infrastructure has been completed. However, additional equipment is being mobilized for higher mining volumes and the cleaner circuit expansion, to include columns and Jameson cell flotation technology, is progressing towards commissioning in early 2024. The focus remains on stripping of waste and the final ramp-up of the process plant to full production capacity, which was challenged by the metallurgical characteristics of the shallow ore. Oxide material has been impacting recoveries, but the ore profile has been updated to reflect the classification of material and provide a good understanding of the impact of this material on plant performance and recoveries. Recovery and concentrate quality are continuously improving as supply of the fresher sulphide ore increases, consistent with expectations from the geo-metallurgical understanding of the deposit. Commercial production and full plant throughput is expected in 2024.\nOn February 20, 2024, the Company filed an updated NI 43-101 Technical Report on Mineral Resources and Reserves for the Las Cruces Underground Project. The purpose of the Technical Report is to update the 2022 Mineral Resources estimate, declare a Mineral Reserves estimate and to provide commentary on the project development strategy. Polymetallic Primary Sulphides (Underground) Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources have increased from 36.2 million tonnes from the January 2022 Technical Report to 41.4 million tonnes with the copper equivalent grade decreasing from 2.51% to 2.29%. There is an additional 5.0 million tonnes of Polymetallic Primary Sulphides tabled as stockpiles and 0.9 million tonnes of Secondary Sulphide (Underground Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources).\nOTHER DEVELOPMENTS\nZambian mines secure 100% renewable power with new Power Supply Agreement (\u201cPSA\u201d)\nOn November 27, 2023, a 10-year PSA was signed between the Company and ZESCO, the Zambian state energy provider. As part of the agreement, ZESCO is committed to supplying 100% certified renewable power, principally hydroelectricity, to Trident and Kansanshi.\nThis agreement marks an important step in the Company\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions reduction plan and underlines the Company\u2019s commitment to sustainability, and lowering the carbon intensity of responsibly mined copper production.\nZambian Power Supply\nThe Kariba Lake level closed the fourth quarter of 2023 at 477.23 meters (\u201cm\u201d), compared to 475.60m recorded at the same time last year. The rainy season in Zambia generally starts in November and continues through April, with the heaviest rainfall normally experienced in the months of January, February and March. However, the lower than normal rains experienced in the current rainy season have resulted in a reduction in water allocation for ZESCO\u2019s electricity generation. ZESCO is currently implementing mitigation measures to address the lower water allocation. No extended power restrictions are expected for the Zambian mining operations beyond normal fluctuations on the national grid.\nPioneering full battery dump truck trials for green mining\nHitachi Construction Machinery Co.,Ltd. (\u201cHitachi\u201d) completed the construction of the full battery dump truck and shipped it to the Kansanshi mine in January 2024. The technological feasibility trials are expected to start in mid-2024.\nThe development and trials of the full battery dump truck, in partnership with Hitachi, will leverage First Quantum\u2019s industry-leading trolley assist expertise. This will be key to the next phase of the Company\u2019s climate change strategy as it seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with mining operations.\nCOMPLETE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nThe complete Consolidated Financial Statements and Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis for the three months and year-ended December 31, 2023 are available at www.first-quantum.com and at www.sedarplus.com and should be read in conjunction with this news release.\nCONFERENCE CALL DETAILS\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast to discuss the results on Wednesday, February 21, 2024 at 9:00 am (EST).\nConference call and webcast details:\nToll-free North America: 1-800-319-4610\nToll-free International: +1-604-638-5340\nWebcast: Direct link or on our website\nA replay of the webcast will be available on the First Quantum website.\nFor further information, visit our website at www.first-quantum.com or contact:\nBonita To, Director, Investor Relations\n(416) 361-6400 Toll-free: 1 (888) 688-6577\nE-Mail: info@fqml.com\nREGULATORY DISCLOSURES\nNon-GAAP and Other Financial Measures\nEBITDA, ADJUSTED EARNINGS (LOSS) AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE\nEBITDA, adjusted earnings (loss) and adjusted earnings (loss) per share exclude certain impacts which the Company believes are not reflective of the Company\u2019s underlying performance for the reporting period.

Realized metal prices are calculated as gross metal sales revenues divided by the volume of metal sold in lbs. Net realized metal price is inclusive of the treatment and refining charges (TC/RC) and freight charges per lb.\nOPERATING CASHFLOW PER SHARE\nIn calculating the operating cash flow per share, the operating cash flow calculated for IFRS purposes is divided by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding for the respective period.\nNET DEBT\nNet debt is comprised of bank overdrafts and total debt less unrestricted cash and cash equivalents.\nCASH COST, ALL-IN SUSTAINING COST, TOTAL COST\nThe consolidated cash cost (C1), all-in sustaining cost (AISC) and total cost (C3) presented by the Company are measures that are prepared on a basis consistent with the industry standard definitions by the World Gold Council and Brook Hunt cost guidelines but are not measures recognized under IFRS. In calculating the C1 cash cost, AISC and C3, total cost for each segment, the costs are measured on the same basis as the segmented financial information that is contained in the financial statements.\nC1 cash cost includes all mining and processing costs less any profits from by-products such as gold, silver, zinc, pyrite, cobalt, sulphuric acid, or iron magnetite and is used by management to evaluate operating performance. TC/RC and freight deductions on metal sales, which are typically recognized as a component of sales revenues, are added to C1 cash cost to arrive at an approximate cost of finished metal.\nAISC is defined as cash cost (C1) plus general and administrative expenses, sustaining capital expenditure, deferred stripping, royalties and lease payments and is used by management to evaluate performance inclusive of sustaining expenditure required to maintain current production levels.\nC3 total cost is defined as AISC less sustaining capital expenditure, deferred stripping and general and administrative expenses net of insurance, plus depreciation and exploration. This metric is used by management to evaluate the operating performance inclusive of costs not classified as sustaining in nature such as exploration and depreciation.\n| For the three months ended

Gold prices rose.\nCaught in the slipstream of this chipmaker hit and the week's Wall St rotation, global megacaps such as Nvidia are set to fall for the third day.\nIt's a different picture for small caps however.\nThe Russell 2000 of soared 3.5% on Tuesday - its fifth straight day of gains greater than 1%, its longest winning streak since April 2000 and highest level since January 2022.\nJumping more than 10% over the past week, the index of mostly domestic-facing smaller business is now up almost 12% for the year to date - narrowing the gap with the S&P500's 19% for 2024 so far and the 21% rise in the Nasdaq 100.\nAdjusting for the outsized weightings of the megacaps, the equal-weighted S&P500 is now up almost 9% for the year.\nAnd futures suggest the Russell will hold those gains later.\nThe gist of the argument behind the shift to better valued small caps from the pricy tech bellwethers is both stepped up interest rate cut speculation but also the tax, tariff and reshoring lean of a possible Trump return - now that his lead in betting markets for a November win has surged to more than 70%.\nThat home bias has been absorbed pretty well across the board by the big stock indexes so far, with the S&P500 also up marginally to new highs on Tuesday.\nVOLATILITY CREEPING BACK\nBut there are growing signs of volatility and disruption creeping back in - with S&P500 futures down almost 1% ahead of the Wednesday's bell and Nasdaq futures off 1.3%.\nThe VIX volatility gauge was at its highest in more than a month.\nThe economic backdrop to the stock market churn seems less worrying.\nResuming U.S. disinflation still has futures fully pricing a first Fed rate cut in September and 65 basis points of rate cuts by year-end. Canada's surprisingly soft June inflation update reinforced that view.",

You can start this week.\nMarket Uncertainty\nMatthew Jones, precious metals analyst at Solomon Global, said that any major political shift will have an effect on financial markets, just by introducing an element of uncertainty.\n\u201cUncertainty often leads to volatility, and both are known to be big price drivers for gold,\u201d he said.\nJones noted that Harris\u2019 proposed policies could lead to changes in government spending and regulatory approaches. Harris supports increased government spending on social programs, as well as infrastructure and climate initiatives.\n\u201cSuch expenditure could lead to higher budget deficits, which might weaken the dollar and increase inflation expectations,\u201d said Jones.\nIn this scenario, investors have historically turned to gold as a hedge against inflation. If they do, the increased demand could push up gold prices. \u201cWhen inflation hits, gold becomes the go-to, the one thing investors cling to for safety,\u201d offered David Materazzi, CEO at Galileo FX.\nLearn More: How Much Is Vice President Kamala Harris Worth?\nTax Policy\n\u201cA few of her ideas include raising the corporate tax from 21% to 28%, raising the income tax level for earners over $400,000 to 39.6%, taxing LTCG (long-term capital gains) as ordinary income for individuals with taxable income over $1 million along with a 25% unrealized gains tax on the ultra-wealthy,\u201d said Anthony DeLuca, CFP and expert with Annuity.org.\nThese policies, which could bring positive outcomes, could potentially have some unintended consequences, said DeLuca.\n\u201cAll the above will result in is raised cost of goods which will be passed down to the consumer, more government spending which will devalue the dollar and raise our already out-of-control government debt issue and keep business owners from expanding,\u201d he said.\nIncreased Demand for Gold\nPolitical shifts can trigger changes in investor behavior.\n\u201cWhenever a Democratic president gets elected, conservatives around the nation start sounding the armageddon alarm and declaring the end of days,\u201d said Brandon Thor, CEO of Thor Metals Group. He also said that conservatives make up a significant portion of gold buyers, which could lead to increased demand for gold as a safe haven asset.",

It\u2019s part of a larger consumer trend for all things gold \u2014 from bullion to beans and bracelets \u2014 that has gripped the mainland.\n\u201cIt\u2019s basically impossible to lose money from buying gold,\u201d reasoned Hong, a college freshman studying computer science in Fujian province who in January began buying gold beans because of their relatively low cost of about 600 yuan ($83) per gram. She has more than two grams of the beans and will continue buying them as long as costs are lower than international gold prices, she said.\nBranded as an investment entry point for young consumers, the beans, which come in glass jars, are the latest hot-selling items in Chinese jewelry stores. Generation Z consumers \u2014 buffeted by high youth unemployment and the nation\u2019s slide into deflation \u2014 are now among the top consumers of gold accessories in the world\u2019s second-largest economy, according to the 2023 China Jewelry Consumer Trends Report by Chow Tai Fook Jewelery Group Ltd. The attraction of gold comes as people pull back on shopping amid months of disappointing growth.\nChina Gold Rush\nA lack of faith in traditional investments has fueled this new China gold rush.\nThe nation\u2019s stock market has seen declines after reopening from the pandemic, with one of its key benchmarks dropping to levels last seen in 2018. The country\u2019s middle class is bearing the brunt of a property downturn \u2014 while the central bank has lowered a key interest rate four times since December 2021, eating into the return on wealth management products.\nYoung people are skipping \u201cpleasurable consumption\u201d and instead purchasing \u201casset-style jewelry\u201d such as gold beans for adornment and investments, said Nikos Kavalis, managing director at the London-based consultancy Metals Focus Ltd.\nHowever, he cautions that it makes no sense to invest in gold beans \u2014 or other gold items \u2014 because their price is often 10% to 30% higher than the commodity\u2019s spot price. Investors would be better served by parking money in gold ETFs, he said.\nStill, the fascination with gold is sweeping across social media. On Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of X, formerly Twitter, the hashtag \u201cWhy Are Young People Getting into Buying Gold\u201d garnered 91 million hits. A lively discussion about the enduring value of gold dominates the social media site, with one popular post stating that \u201cbuying gold keeps troubles at bay.\u201d\nThree-quarters of gold consumers are now estimated to be between 25 and 35 years old and many believe investing in gold is low-risk, according to a 2021 report from the World Gold Council. That belief is reinforced as gold prices have hit multiple historic highs since December. Gold bullion passed the $2,100 per ounce threshold for the first time this month.\nSales of gold, silver and jewelery reached a six-year high in December, a 29.4% year-on-year jump, according to government data. Precious metals now represent one of the fastest-growing consumer markets in China.\nBuying gold beans for gifting and investments also reached a peak during China\u2019s lunar new year, says a spokesperson from Chinese jeweler Luk Fook Holdings International Ltd.\nEven banks have joined traditional gold retailers to sell gold beans. China Merchants Bank Co., for example, introduced its line of gold bean sets in July 2023.\n\u201cDespite the recent surge in China\u2019s gold price, consumers are still demonstrating a strong preference for gold,\u201d said Cindy Yeung, chairwoman and managing director of Emperor Watch & Jewellery Ltd. Like other major jewelry retailers, Emperor is talking up gold on social media and e-commerce platforms.\nImpure Beans\nThere are perils for consumers of gold beans and other gold objects who aren\u2019t knowledgeable about the difference between authentic gold and fakes, experts say.\nLily Chen, a 26-year-old Shanghai office worker, discovered almost all of the gold beans she had purchased were mixed with iron, zinc and copper when she recently tried to exchange them for a gold bracelet.\n\u201cI never tried cutting corners by buying gold at ultra-cheap prices, and I made sure to buy from star-rated web stores. But this could still happen,\u201d she said.\nNonetheless, the craze for anything gold continues to play out on social media. College students are posting diary-like entries on gold purchases, couples share how they repaired strained relationships with gold gifts \u2014 and metal resellers and collectors offer gold investing advice.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nAn Influential Economics Forum Has a Troubling Surplus of Trolls\nDollar\u2019s Superpower Status at Risk From Turmoil at Home and Abroad\nGold-Medalist Coders Build an AI That Can Do Their Job for Them\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

Its influence is such that it affects borrowing costs around the globe, as well as helping to form other central banks\u2019 decisions. It means that further sustained high rates in the US could impact mortgage borrowers and employers in the UK.\nMr Powell also rejected pressure on the Fed to take greater responsibility for tackling climate change.\n\u201cFed policymakers are often pressed to take a position on issues that are arguably relevant to the economy but are not within our mandate, such as particular tax and spending policies, immigration policy, and trade policy,\u201d he said.\n\u201cClimate change is another current example. Policies to address climate change are the business of elected officials and those agencies that they have charged with this responsibility. The Fed has received no such charge.\u201d\nThe Bank of England, by contrast, has found itself in the midst of political arguments on climate change which have seen its mandate repeatedly changed with shifting emphasis placed on the environment.\nMr Powell\u2019s warning on interest rates also threatens to derail the Bank of England\u2019s plans to lower borrowing costs, as a significant break with Fed policy risks sending the pound falling against the dollar and pushing up the price of imported goods. The Bank of England\u2019s base rate has stood at 5.25pc since August.\nTraders in financial markets expect the Bank to cut to 5pc in June, with the Fed possibly waiting until a month later before it makes its first move downward.\nAmerica\u2019s economy has proven remarkably resilient to higher borrowing costs.\nEven as the UK fell into a brief recession at the end of last year and the eurozone economy ground to a halt, the world\u2019s largest economy expanded by 0.8pc in the final quarter of 2023.\nThis growth has helped keep inflation above the Fed\u2019s target and so leaves policymakers cautious when it comes to cutting rates.\n\u201cRecent readings on both job gains and inflation have come in higher than expected,\u201d said Mr Powell.\n\u201cThe economy added an average of 265,000 jobs per month in the three months through February, a faster pace than we have seen since last June. And the higher inflation data over January and February were above the low readings in the second half of last year.\u201d\nNancy Vanden Houten at Oxford Economics said this economic strength \u201ccomes down to the US consumer.\u201d\n\u201cWhen mortgage rates started to climb we saw a toll taken on housing activity, but all in all, given the magnitude of higher rates, the housing sector has been pretty resilient,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBy and large the consumer in the US has continued to chug along and spend at a healthy pace, and that has been the main reason for growth staying so strong.\u201d\nInflation in the eurozone fell more sharply than expected in March, with prices up 2.4pc on the year. Inflation has not been lower since mid-2021.\nMeanwhile gold prices hit a fresh record high of just over $2295 per ounce, up from $2066 at the start of the year as investors pile into safe-haven assets.\nRead the latest updates below.\n06:22 PM BST\nSigning off...\nThanks for joining us.

However, the U.S. Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) data for February is due on Friday and could be a significant indicator. Gold is currently bullish, with analysts forecasting a 70% chance of a rate cut in June. Conversely, high gold prices may reduce demand, particularly in India, where imports fell by 90% in March.\nOperations\nKinross has six producing mines and two major advanced projects: the Great Bear in Canada and the smaller Manh Choh project in Alaska (70% owned), both of which have near-term production potential.\nThe two most important mines are Paracatu in Brazil and Tasiast in Mauritania. Tasiast is regarded as relatively safe in the region due to its location on the coast, far from the Mali border. The company has now completed the construction of a 34-megawatt solar power plant and, despite its lower grade, it expects high output in 2024.\nParacatu had a strong 2023, but costs are expected to be higher, so gold production will likely be lower in 2024.\nFinally, La Coipa in Chile is expected to have a strong production this year, while the U.S. operations at Bald Mountain, Round Mountain and Fort Knox are all doing well. Fort Knox is on track to finish the mill modification for the Man Choh project, which is expected to be completed in the second half of the year.\n2023 gold production was 2,153,020 ounces, up from 2,201,599 ounces the year prior, which included the sale of the Kupol mine in the second quarter of 2022. In addition, revenue in 2022 may vary slightly due to the quarterly results being restated.\nThe Great Bear and Manh Choh projects\nThe Great Bear Project is the company's largest operation and is scheduled to be completed by 2027. Exploration in 2023 added significant measured and indicated mineral resources, now reaching 2.81 million ounces. The increase was primarily due to underground growth at the 500- to 1,000-meter level.\nThe project was acquired in February 2022 and is regarded as having high potential to become a top-tier deposit that will boost the company's future production.\nCEO Paul Rollinson said during the conference call:\n\"At Great Bear, we continue to make excellent progress. Looking back to the time of the acquisition just two years ago, we started with no declared resources. Today, we have approximately 2.8 million ounces of high-grade M&I and an incremental 3.3 million of high-grade inferred ounces.\"\nFurther, the 70%-owned Manh Choh Project in Alaska is on track for first production in the second half of the year. The project is expected to boost the company's production profile in Alaska by approximately 640,000 attributable gold equivalent ounces, while lowering costs over the mine's lifetime. Manh Choh's initial production is expected in the second half of 2024. The Manh Choh ore will be processed at Fort Knox's mill, which has been modified to accommodate the increased capacity.\nFourth-quarter results snapshot\nRevenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1.11 billion with net income of $65.40 million, or 5 cents per diluted share. The adjusted net earnings of $140 million, or 11 cents, exceeded analysts' expectations.\nIn the fourth quarter, production was 546,513 gold equivalent ounces, an 8.25% decrease from the previous year, with sales of 565,389 gold equivalent ounces. Kinross Gold indicated production of 1,957,237 gold equivalent ounces for 2022, omitting the production of Kupol Mine in Russia, which was sold in the second quarter of that year.\nIf we compare production per mine, we can see that production at Paracatu is declining significantly. This trend is likely to continue in 2024.\nThe company expects its 2024 production to be approximately 2.10 million gold equivalent ounces, dropping slightly to 2 million in 2025 and 2026.\nSource: Kinross Gold presentation.\nThe realized gold price was $1,974 per ounce sold, and the all-in sustaining cost was $1,353. Production in 2023 met expectations. The AISC remains well above $1,300 per ounce and is expected to remain high until 2026.\nHopefully, the company will be able to reduce its AISC below $1,300 per ounce by 2025 due to production from Manh Choh in Alaska and lower energy costs at Tasiast.\nAs of December, cash and cash equivalents were $352.40 million and total liquidity was approximately $1.90 billion. Long-term debt, including current, is now $2.23 billion. The net debt is now $1.88 billion and continues to go down.\nSource: Kinross Gold presentation.\nDuring the conference call, Chief Financial Officer Andrea Freeborough said:\n\"We aimed to further delever our balance sheet in 2024, as we plan to allocate excess free cash generated this year, against the 2025 term loan. The term loan will be re-classified to current in our Q1 financials given its maturity in March 2025.\"\nKinross' board of directors also declared a quarterly dividend of 3 cents per common share for the fourth quarter.\n\"We have a strong 2023, and successfully delivered on our targets and are well-positioned for another strong year ahead. Our operations are performing well. Our projects are advancing on schedule and on budget. Our exploration program, is delivering value. We are generating substantial free cash flow, and our balance sheet is in excellent condition, and continues to deliver.\"\nFinally, trailing 12-month free cash flow was $392.90 million. The company had a free cash flow of $75.30 million for the quarter. I expect free cash flow to climb substantially in 2024 with gold prices now around $2,200 per ounce.\nTechnical analysis and commentary\nNote: The chart is adjusted for the dividend.\nShares of Kinross Gold follow a descending channel pattern, with resistance at $6.20 and support at $5.48.\nDescending channel patterns are bearish formations that typically result in a bullish breakout. Kinross moves slowly and can be tedious for action traders.\nI recommend trading short-term LIFO for about 50% and maintaining a core long-term position with a final target of $7 or higher. The gold price is now around $2,200 per ounce, and the next quarter's earnings should be a good catalyst for a significant breakout.\nI recommend selling roughly half of your position between $6.15 and $6.25, with possible upper resistance at $6.30, and buying the stock between $5.50 and $5.35, with potential lower support at $5.15.\nTrading LIFO allows you to keep your old position, typically underwater in Kinross' case, while trading your most recent position for a profit without selling your long position at an unnecessary loss. You never sell LIFO for a loss; instead, you sell for a profit of 3% to 10% depending on your strategy and available cash.\nRepeating this exercise can provide a steady income, allowing you to derisk your long-term position.\nWarning: To remain relevant, the technical chart must be updated regularly.",

Men wore flimsy plastic shopping bags on their heads. One had swimming goggles and another a rice bag covering his torso.\nThe unlicensed gold mining industry, known in Ghana as \"galamsey\", has grown at a breakneck pace this year as global gold prices have risen by almost 30%, enticing new entrants.\nSmall-scale mines produced 1.2 million ounces of gold in the first seven months of this year, more than in the whole of 2023, according to data from Ghana's mining sector regulator.\nAbout 40% of Ghana's total gold output comes from small mines, as opposed to concessions operated by multi-national firms. Some 70-80% of the small mines are unlicensed.\nPOISONED PROFITS\nMartin Ayisi, head of Ghana's Minerals Commission, the mining industry regulator, said most galamsey gold was smuggled out of the country and was therefore not contributing to national gold export revenues.\nFor Ayisi, the rise in gold prices is good for Ghana, helping it recover from a severe economic crisis in 2022 that required a $3-billion IMF bailout.\n\"We should be able to get a lot of money and probably exit the IMF programme earlier,\" he said, forecasting national gold export revenues would more than double to $10 billion this year.\nBut industry experts say the lines between legal mining and galamsey are blurred, and gold from informal mines represents a larger proportion of revenues than the authorities acknowledge.\nThe dangers of galamsey, however, are not in dispute.\nDozens of miners have been killed in collapsing pits in recent years, according to news reports and human rights groups, while hospitals and health centres report high numbers of early deaths from pulmonary diseases of miners and residents of towns and villages near mines.\nThese are caused by inhaling dust that contains heavy metals such as lead, as well as poisonous fumes from the mercury and nitric acid the miners use to leach gold out of sediment.\nThe chemicals are then dumped on the ground or in rivers. Ghana's water authority says mercury and heavy metals from mining have contaminated about 65% of water sources.\nMeanwhile, thousands of hectares (acres) of cocoa plantations and virgin forest have been destroyed by illegal miners, according to data from Global Forest Watch, an online monitoring platform.\nProtesters have taken to the streets in Accra in recent weeks to criticise President Nana Akufo-Addo's government over what they saw as its failure to tackle these problems. \"Leaders, you've failed us!\" read some of the placards.\n\"Galamsey has to stop. We want to live long. We don't want to fall sick. We don't want to go to the hospital,\" said Aboubacar Sadekh, who was taking part in a march on Sept. 22, draped in a Ghanaian flag.\nThe government denies that it is failing to act on galamsey. When he came to power in 2017, Akufo-Addo pledged to take action on the issue, and during his time in office the government has launched crackdowns, deploying soldiers to arrest illegal miners. In some cases, mining equipment was seized and destroyed.\nORGANISED CRIME\nOpinion polls suggest galamsey is one of the top five issues for voters ahead of a Dec. 7 general election.\nThe main candidates to replace outgoing Akufo-Addo as president, Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia and former President John Mahama, have pledged to formalise galamsey, for example by funding a state agency to explore for gold and map areas for locals to mine.\nBut successive governments have been promising for years to tackle the problem without making much headway, partly because powerful people are benefitting from the industry, experts say.\nChris Aston, head of a British-backed programme aimed at regulating small-scale gold mining in Ghana, said artisanal miners were vulnerable to organised crime gangs, who provide them with funding for equipment up-front, unlike other lenders.\n\"Miner pre-financing is one way that organised crime groups can penetrate the gold supply chain,\" he said. Funders then \"require miners to sell the gold they mine back to them at a subsidised rate\".\nEmmanuel Kwesi Anning, a security consultant based in Accra, said galamsey was fuelling an increase in gun-trafficking because those overseeing illegal mines sought armed protection against rivals or thieves.\nHe also said politicians and traditional rulers in some areas were taking a cut of galamsey profits, further entrenching the problem.\n\"It has become an elite consensus that they'll not touch this business.\"\nGhana's information minister did not respond to requests for comments on the allegations of organised crime involvement, gun running and corruption.\nA top official in the National Security Ministry, who did not wish to be named because they were not authorised to speak about the issue in public, said authorities were working to address the links between illegal mining, money laundering and gun trafficking.\n(Reporting by Maxwell Akalaare Adombila; Editing by Estelle Shirbon and Frances Kerry)",

Two-year Treasury yields hit their lowest since June on Friday and 10-year yields their lowest in three months, although they edged higher on Monday.\nEncouraging the disinflationary theme, oil prices extended declines, pressured by investor scepticism over the latest OPEC+ decision on supply cuts and uncertainty surrounding global fuel demand. U.S. crude hit its lowest in two weeks and is tracking year-on-year losses of almost 10%.\nWith rate cuts expected at least as soon as the Fed in Europe and around the world, the dollar held up well.\nAttention turns squarely to the labor market this week, with a series of updates on jobs and hiring that culminates in the November payrolls report on Friday. Hiring is expected to have picked up last month, but with the jobless rate staying at 3.9%.\nWall St stocks futures held the bulk of Friday's gains before the bell on Monday - giving back just 0.2%.\nSome concerns about the resumption of fighting in Gaza and attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea saw volatility levels pop marginally higher and gold prices briefly surged to a new record before giving back all of those gains.\nOne of the worries about U.S. stock gains in the year to date has been the breadth, or lack of it, with a narrow leadership of megacap tech names. But that is widening into yearend as peak rate hopes encourage some rotation to smaller cap stocks. The S&P equal-weighted index is now up 6% for 2023.",

Now, it\u2019s chasing a different clientele: precious metal investors and collectors.\nCostco recently started selling silver coins for the first time, finance chief Richard Galanti told CNN.\nThe company is selling 25-count tubes of 1 oz. Canada Maple Leaf Silver Coins online for $675. The front of the coins features a maple leaf, and King Charles III is on the back.

It began selling $2,000 gold bars online in September and sold more than $100 million worth of the bars last quarter.\nBut Costco\u2019s move is more about marketing than just about increasing sales. After all, not many people are actually stashing away gold bars in their homes.\nIt\u2019s selling precious metals to try to reinforce its \u201ctreasure hunt\u201d brand image where it peppers its stores with unexpected, limited-time items to keep shoppers coming back.\n\u201cWe try to create an attitude that, if you see it, you ought to buy it because chances are it ain\u2019t going to be there next time,\u201d Costco\u2019s founder once said. \u201cThat\u2019s the treasure-hunt aspect. We constantly buy that stuff and intentionally run out of it from time to time.\u201d\nCostco is also selling precious metals as they become more valuable. Gold prices have notched record highs this week. Silver futures are up 21% in the past year.\nPrecious metal prices have gone up because investors are betting that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in the back half of the year.\nGold and silver are considered to be one of the most resilient investments. When interest rates fall, holding income-paying assets (like bonds) becomes less appealing than owning the precious metals. When interest rates are low, falling or \u2014 as in this case \u2014 expected to fall, demand for Treasury bonds ebbs, and precious metals, which don\u2019t pay out any interest, become relatively more attractive.\nSome investors also believe them to be a hedge against inflation, wagering that they will hold their value even if it begins to surge, even though metals face price fluctuations like any other commodity.\nCostco\u2019s success in selling the metals comes as the company continues to report strong profits from the pandemic in 2020, when customers rushed to stores to load up on groceries and household staples. Millions of first-time customers signed up for club memberships during the pandemic and have held on to them, pushing Costco\u2019s member rolls to all-time highs.\nShares of Costco (COST) have rallied 60% over the past year.",

The value of transactions involving cash is just a tenth of the total, the BRC said.\nBy avoiding the anonymity of cash-in-hand transactions, card payments and digital transfers make it easier for the authorities to levy the 20pc transaction tax.\nMr Hughes told a Budget event at the Resolution Foundation think tank: \u201cThe Government\u2019s efforts to crack down on tax avoidance have also boosted the tax to GDP ratio without raising anybody\u2019s rate, so the Government deserves some credit on working harder to collect some peoples\u2019 tax.\n\u201cThe death of cash is making that easier as well.\u201d\nMr Hunt, the Chancellor, announced plans to give HMRC more resources to chase taxes the state is owed in Wednesday\u2019s Budget.\nHe said: \u201cI will provide HMRC with the resources they need to ensure everyone pays the tax they owe leading to an increase in revenue collected of over \u00a34.5bn across the forecast period.\u201d\nThere are currently \u00a381.3bn worth of banknotes in circulation, according to the Bank of England, up by 44pc from \u00a356.2bn in 2014.\nFigures from the OBR also indicated that taxpayers face a \u00a3104.2bn bill to cover losses linked to the Bank of England\u2019s money-printing programme amid warnings that a jump in interest rates could push up the cost by a further \u00a350bn.\nThe Bank hoovered up almost \u00a3900bn of UK debt during the pandemic and financial crisis in an effort to prop up the economy. The process is known as quantitative easing (QE).\nAt the time, it generated huge profits that were transferred to the Treasury as the Bank made more money on its holdings of UK gilts than the interest it paid on reserves held by commercial lenders.\nThis has reversed as interest rates have surged from their record lows. The Bank has also started actively selling some of its stockpile of gilts at a loss.\n\u201cSince Bank Rate and gilt yields rose from their record lows in the second half of 2022, the Bank of England\u2019s Asset Purchase Facility (APF) has gone from making a profit to making a loss,\u201d said the OBR. \u201cHaving transferred \u00a3123.9bn of cash profits to the Treasury between January 2013 and October 2022, a total of \u00a349.4bn has been transferred from the Treasury to cover losses incurred by the APF since then.\u201d\nThe OBR said its current estimate of the lifetime cost of quantitative tightening as the Bank continues to reduce its stockpile of debt was \u00a321.9bn lower than forecast in November as lower interest rates reduce the Bank\u2019s costs.\nIt said the estimate was highly sensitive to changes in interest rates. If interest rates average 3.4pc in the coming year instead of the 4.4pc it was currently predicting, the lifetime cost would fall to \u00a346.6bn, according to the OBR. By contrast, if interest rates averaged 5.4pc for the whole year, the lifetime cost would soar to \u00a3156.9bn.\nThe OBR cautioned that these estimates for the cost of QE were far from comprehensive because money printing \u201csupported the economy, asset prices, and financial markets at various points of stress over the past 15 years\u201d.\nRead the latest updates below.\n08:08 PM GMT\nThat\u2019s all for today...\nThanks for joining us on the Markets blog.

Investor enthusiasm for sustained economic growth and higher earnings, especially from megacap tech companies, is propelling the rally.\nBut gold is quietly up nearly 20% year to date -- outperforming the S&P 500. Prices of the yellow stuff are knocking on the door of $2,500 per ounce -- a more than $600-per-ounce climb from levels seen last fall.\nHere's how to approach gold right now, some of the catalysts driving the price higher, and whether gold is worth investing in.\nA safe haven amid uncertainty\nPlenty of factors influence gold prices -- such as basic supply and demand. If a major buyer (like a country) is loading up on gold reserves, but gold mining is down, then the price could rise due to a supply/demand imbalance. It could also fall if production soars from a newly discovered mine, or a major producer expands its output. Since gold is a global market, the price can also vary based on where gold is being purchased and in what quantity -- as is the nature of commodities that are prone to arbitrage.\nMonetary policy also impacts the price of gold. Lower interest rates can boost spending and weaken the U.S. dollar, which can raise the price of dollar-denominated gold.\nIn general, the single greatest catalyst that can drive gold prices is its use as a store of value. Gold starkly contrasts a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar -- which has no intrinsic value and is instead backed by the strength of the U.S. economy. Fears of instability can lead to increased interest in gold.\nWhereas equity markets love certainty, the gold market benefits from instability. Basically, gold can be a place of refuge when the economy is under pressure and geopolitical tensions are running high.\nAn epic rally in equities and gold\nThe following chart shows two sizable gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) -- the SPDR Gold Shares ETF(NYSEMKT: GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust(NYSEMKT: IAU) compared to the performance of the Nasdaq Composite, S&P 500, and Dow Jones Industrial Average so far this year.\nETFs are an alternative to buying physical gold bullion or gold coins -- which can have a markup over the spot price, security risks, and potentially high storage fees. SPDR Gold Shares and the iShares Gold Trust own gold assets and use a custodian that holds the gold on their behalf. SPDR Gold Shares charges a 0.4% expense ratio, or $4 for every $1,000 invested compared to a 0.25% expense ratio for the iShares Gold Trust. Both ETFs can be simpler, lower-cost, and more liquid ways to invest in gold.\nHistorically, it is fairly uncommon to see gold keep pace with a sizable rally in the major U.S. equity indexes. But over the last five years, gold has put up monster gains -- not quite as good as the Nasdaq Composite or S&P 500, but better than the Dow and far better than a risk-free rate or bond.\nGold vs. the U.S. stock market\nThe challenge with owning gold long-term is that it doesn't have the same growth catalysts as equities. Growth stocks can increase in value based on their potential future earnings.\nBlue chip dividend stocks like Coca-Cola steadily grow their earnings and, in turn, their payout to investors. The passive income component, paired with potential growth in the value of the business, is a clear reason to buy and hold this type of stock.\nGold doesn't have a management team or financial statements. Its supply and demand are changing. It has some utility, but not in the same way oil or electricity are valued.\nBut gold is a globally recognized store of value and has been for millennia. It has a track record that far exceeds any single company or economy.\nGold can be seen as a way to protect wealth, especially for countries without a stable fiat currency.\nIntroducing gold to your portfolio\nThe simplest way for gold to outperform the major indexes in 2024 is if U.S. stocks pull back. This could happen for a variety of reasons, like valuation concerns or some major companies missing earnings estimates. Gold could also keep rising if uncertainty increases due to myriad factors, such as economic indicators like interest rates, credit card debt, housing prices, or geological reasons.\nRecommendations vary, but gold should probably be no more than 5% to 10% of a diversified portfolio. However, stocks provide a far better potential investment over the long term.\nIf you are worried about a stock market sell-off, a better approach than pounding the sell button and fleeing to gold is ensuring that your portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance. Having too much of a portfolio in expensive growth stocks may not be the best decision if it doesn't align with your investment time horizon or risk tolerance. Putting new capital to work in value-orientated sectors of the market is an excellent way to stay invested while also balancing out your portfolio.\nIn sum, there are plenty of safer asset classes out there. Gold is one of them, and it has been surging due to forecasts for lower interest rates, increased economic and political uncertainty, and other factors. But overhauling a portfolio's composition just because of something that could happen in the short term is a great way to lose your shirt.\nThe best way to approach gold is to determine your desired allocation in your portfolio and how you want to split up that allocation between physical gold, gold ETFs, or even gold mining stocks. That way, you can enforce checks and balances on your portfolio and ensure you set yourself up to hit your financial goals rather than teeter on the brink of speculation.\nShould you invest $1,000 in SPDR Gold Trust right now?\nBefore you buy stock in SPDR Gold Trust, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and SPDR Gold Trust wasn\u2019t one of them.

Additionally, it has 50% investment in a joint venture with TUI AG, which operates the brand, TUI Cruises.\nThe company\u2019s cruise brands primarily serve the contemporary, premium and deluxe segments of the cruise vacation industry, which also includes the budget and luxury segments. These brands operate 64 ships. The ships operate on a selection of diverse itineraries worldwide that include roughly 1,000 destinations on all seven continents.\nThe company reports revenues under the following segments \u2014 Passenger ticket revenues (65.5% of total revenues in 2022) and Onboard and other revenues (34.5%).\nAcross the company\u2019s five brands, nearly 5.5 million guests sailed in 2022. By the end of 2022, 64 out of 75 ships returned to operations, representing more than 85% of its worldwide capacity. The company\u2019s bookings improved sequentially by 2022-end. As of Dec 31, 2022, the company had nearly $4.2 billion in customer deposits.\nIn the third quarter of 2022, the company unveiled a three-year financial performance initiative - Trifecta Program, thereby articulating longer-term financial objectives. The program emphasizes on financial coordinates, including Adjusted EBITDA per APCD, Adjusted EPS and ROIC. Under this program, the company expects to achieve a triple-digit adjusted EBITDA per APCD, exceeding the earlier record adjusted EBITDA per APCD of $87 in 2019. The company also expects to achieve double-digit adjusted earnings per share, exceeding the earlier record adjusted earnings per share of $9.54 in 2019. The company anticipates achieving a return on invested capital in the teens in 2023.\nBottom Line\nWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk.

The reason is simple: They can\u2019t be printed out of thin air like fiat money.\nMoreover, due to their reputation as safe-haven assets, precious metals may experience heightened demand in times of geopolitical uncertainty or war.\nKiyosaki has long been a fan of gold and first purchased the yellow metal in 1972. He has explained in the past it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t \u201ctrust\u201d the Federal Reserve, which controls the supply of money.\nIn October, he predicted, \u201cGold will soon break through $2,100 and then take off. You will wish you had bought gold below $2,000. Next stop gold $3,700.\u201d\nKiyosaki likes silver, too. \u201cSilver from $23 to $68 an ounce,\u201d he said, projecting major upside for the gray metal.\nThe price of gold surged by more than 10% in 2023, while silver remained relatively unchanged.\nToday, there are many ways to gain exposure to gold and silver, but Kiyosaki prefers to just buy the metals directly. \u201cI do not touch paper gold or silver ETFs. I only want real gold or silver coins,\u201d he previously wrote.",

        "full_text": "Should You Invest in Costco Gold?\nAs we collectively grapple with what a cut in the federal funds rate will mean for our savings accounts and budgets, some people are looking for other places to invest their money. Some may be considering the original best place to stash some cash: good old-fashioned gold.\nYes, you can still buy gold, and surprisingly enough (or maybe not), you can buy it at Costco. Costco offers gold bars periodically, but they sell out quickly, so if you want a bar, you'll have to be fast. But, they also sell gold coins, and those are still currently in stock, and contain just as much gold as a Costco gold bar.\nSo, should you buy any sort of gold at Costco? Let's discuss.\nWhy do people invest in gold?\nGold is a funny metal, it makes some people feel a lot of things. After all, for the longest time, gold was a significant and permanent store of value, due to its rarity and desirability. In early America, we used it for money in rugged parts of the country, along with other precious metals, and later on, tied the value of our currency directly to it.\nToday, however, our currency is no longer tethered to the value of gold and is instead valued on its own merits and the economy in which it exists. Some people would argue that this is a terrible method of doing things, but frankly, you can't buy cryptocurrency in gold, so we really needed a different way to deal with a changing world.\nStill, some people invest in gold certificates, which represent ownership in a share of gold, and others buy gold bars and coins, which are physical chunks of gold that you can hold in your hand, bury in your backyard, and sell as you please. For this last group of people, physically possessing gold gives them a sense of security should all of civilization go off the rails.\nSometimes I think we'd be better off to start over and try again, but I'm also realistic enough to know I'd never survive an apocalypse, both due to my lack of general survival skills and my lack of stockpiled non-currency currency.\nInvesting in Costco gold\nI checked the Costco website today and the gold bars were all sold out, but the last time I did see them, on Aug. 13, 2024, they were going for $2,519.99 per ounce. That tracks with August's average gold price per ounce of $2,503.38.\nToday, on Sept. 19, 2024, Costco only has gold coins in stock, but they're also one ouncers, and for the low, low price of $2,669.99. The average price of gold so far for September is $2,587.33, so the coins may have about a 3% premium to them, but it's still pretty close.\nLooking at valuation charts for gold over the last 100 years, it seems like gold is pretty volatile, but can have a decent return in times of uncertainty. Since 2022, for example, gold has gone from a low of $1,723.79 to today's high of $2,587.33, but it was also as high as $2,395.59 in 2020, and peaked at $2,743.07 in 1980.\nLet's look at some gold value trends, based off of today's date.\nChange over time | Lowest Value | Highest Value | |\n|---|---|---|---|\n1 year | 36.82% | $1,891.01 | $2,587.33 |\n5 years | 41.86% | $1,723.79 | $2,587.33 |\n10 years | 60.76% | $1,408.08 | $2,587.33 |\n20 years | 285.05% | $671.95 | $2,587.33 |\n50 years | 174.67% | $463.65 | $2,743.07 |\nData source: Macrotrends Gold Prices - 100 Year Historical Chart. Chart by author.\nWith gold being near an all-time high, it seems a little bit reckless to go out and buy it for posterity. After all, although there's been a 36% gain in gold prices in the last year, there's only been a 41% gain in the last five years, so you can't really count on gold to gain value at a steady pace, and if you look at a chart of gold value, it's extremely volatile, sometimes swinging wildly in response to various economic environments.\nBuy this instead of gold\nIn my opinion, and looking at these charts, buying gold only pays off if you're going to hold it for literal decades, but you still risk extremely violent swings. For example, if you bought your gold in January 1980, you'd have paid MORE for it than you did today. That month, it averaged an inflation-adjusted $2,743.07. So, let's say you did that and sold it today -- you'd still lose money.\nYou know what won't do that to you? Investments like Treasury bonds, Treasury notes, and good old-fashioned certificates of deposit. Even though CD rates have dropped a little bit since the Fed announced rate cuts, the average yield for the 2-year CD is still around 3.91% for September, and the 5-year CD is hanging out at 3.71%.\nIf you instead spent your $2,500 on a CD, a 2-year CD will be worth $2,703.00 at maturity, an 8.12% increase, and the 60-month will be worth $3,038.83, a 21.5% increase. Maybe you can't bury it in your backyard, but that's not too shabby for a set-it-and-forget-it investment.\nTop credit card to use at Costco (and everywhere else!)\nWe love versatile credit cards that offer huge rewards everywhere, including Costco!

Today, it\u2019s worth about $4,200 per ounce \u2014 a 262% increase in value. So, if you had invested $1,000 in gold a decade ago, it would be worth approximately $3,620 today. That\u2019s a great return, but how does it compare to, say, an investment in stocks?\nThe S&P 500 rose 174% over the last ten years, for an average annual return of 17.4%. And that doesn\u2019t even include its dividend yield over that time. Consider, too, that as volatile as the S&P 500 is, gold\u2019s returns have varied even more in modern history.\nTrending Now: Barbara Corcoran: This Is the Only Investment I\u2019ll \u2018Never Sell\u2019\nGold\u2019s Uneven History\nWhen Richard Nixon severed the dollar\u2019s gold backing in 1971, the price of gold suddenly began floating at market rates. It consequently skyrocketed over the rest of the 1970s, delivering an average annual return of 40.2%.\nThen the 80s arrived, and the gold party screeched to a halt. From 1980 through the end of 2023, gold notched an average annual return of just 4.4%. However, it\u2019s been booming lately, and as of Oct. 19, 2025, gold futures are priced at about $4,345.\nGold doesn\u2019t work like other investments. Traditional investments like stocks and real estate work because they generate revenue. Investors measure that revenue, assess the likelihood of future revenue growth, and put a value on the investment based on it.\nGold doesn\u2019t produce revenue. In fact, it doesn\u2019t \u201cdo\u201d anything. It sits there and looks pretty. This may not mean much when the rest of the economy hums along healthily, but it can become plenty meaningful when a wrench gets thrown in the gears.\nWhy Investors Look to Gold Futures\nMany investors consider varying amounts of gold to be the ultimate safe-haven investment. When \u201cthe world goes to hell in a handbasket,\u201d investors can buy gold in the form of gold coins, gold ETFs and more.",

The Uganda Investment Authority announced a ground-breaking ceremony at the mine in October last year, and noted at the time that Wagagai's initial investment reached $50m, including for a refinery, which has since risen to $60m.\nThe Ugandan Government is looking to develop domestic mining within its borders to boost the economy. Through the Uganda Free Zone Authority (UFZA), a government agency established for the purposes of creating opportunities for export-oriented investments, is trying to attract foreign investors to sector, which is otherwise dominated by informal mining, by offering tax incentives.\nThe Wagagai mine and refinery has been granted a \u2018free port zone\u2019 under the UFZA, making it exempt from import and export tax. The move may well encourage investment, but has led some to question how the country will benefit \u2013 or whether it will benefit enough \u2013 from the project.\nUganda hopes rewards will come through its newly-overhauled mining code, the Mining and Minerals Bill, which parliament passed this February and is waiting to be signed into law by the president. The code will see the establishment of the Uganda National Mining Company which, under the new bill, will hold 15% free equity in all large and medium mining ventures, as well as have the right to buy up to 20% of extra shares in the mining ventures at the commercial rate.\n\u201cThe new law is intended to provide a robust, predictable and transparent legal regime, improve mining and mineral administration and business processes, ensure efficient collection and management of mineral revenues, promote value addition to minerals and increase mineral trade,\u201d the government has said.\nHowever, gold experts Aaron Hoddinott and Alexander Smith of Pinnacle Digest noted that such legislation introduces the threat of nationalisation to the deposits. This is not uncommon in other countries, and raises the prospect of the vast riches of the deposits becoming tied to the whims of the national government.\nThe bill is also intended to end widespread informal mining, from which the government receives no revenues. Under Ugandan law people can be convicted, imprisoned and face fines if caught illegally mining. Critics have said the move will render more than 20,000 miners effectively jobless, as well as impacting on those indirectly making money through the informal sector, raising question as to who will truly benefits from this vast gold discovery.\nIn response, the government of Uganda has appealed to gold mining investors to use local labourers and train them where necessary to help in the fight against poverty. Uganda\u2019s GDP per capita is currently just $858.1, more than just 18 countries in the world, according to the World Bank.\nWagagai\u2019s activities are expected to create 3,000 direct jobs, though the specifics remain unclear, and the company will construct a new refinery, valued at $200m according to the government.\nHowever, the work of refineries in the region has been dogged by allegations of corruption, posing a threat to local security and dissuading foreign investment..\nIn March, the US imposed sanctions on Belgian businessman Alain Goetz and a network of companies tied to him, including the African Gold Refinery in Uganda. The refinery was set up in 2014 but is accused of being involved in the illicit movement of gold from the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nSmith and Hoddinott have also argued that the validity of the gold reserves in Uganda first need be proven, with geophysical and geochemical surveys and analyses done to date representing only \u201dstep one of 20 exploratory steps needed\u201d.\nFurthermore, the development of any new mining deposit in Uganda isn\u2019t without its risks or challenges; mining activities by both Chinese and other firms in Karamoja, where much of the gold said to be identified is located, have in the past created tensions with local communities. Mining in the region has been subject to a Human Rights Watch investigation, which was critical of miners for environmental damage caused and not providing compensation for those whose land was impacted by the work.\nThe government has tried to address such tensions in the new bill by providing for the participation of host communities in the entire decision-making chain of mining, including information on licences, environment and social impact assessments provided both at the national and local government levels. It also states that training and employment should be prioritised for host communities. However, it remains to be seen how this will work out in practise when the bill finally becomes law.\nFor foreign mining firms looking to operate in Uganda there will also likely be political and corruption risks to consider. Uganda joined the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in 2020 but is yet to be assessed.\nGlobally, White says there has been a decline in the value of gold, particularly in the US market, as the strength of the dollar increases, and this discovery could ultimately undermine its value further.\n\u201cThe bottom line is larger gold reserves tend to lower the value of the metal, due to the increased supply,\u201d White says.\nYet gold remains a safe haven for investments, and is still valued for its ability to protect investors from economic volatility caused by new economic policies or geopolitical shifts.\n\u201cTherefore, it\u2019s likely that by the end of 2022, when this newly discovered gold will begin to be refined and sold, it will certainly boost the Ugandan economy and bring about a significant shift in the global market,\u201d he continues.\n\u201cWhether this will cause prices to rise, or fall will depend on how easy it is to supply this new stock of gold, the economic and political situation at the time, and global interest rates and inflation levels.\u201d\nSmith and Hoddinott\u2019s take is that extraction at the deposits are not \u201deven close to a done deal\u201d and will likely be difficult to get out the ground. They went on to point out that that the world only produces around 3,000 metric tonnes of gold annually and 80 \u2013 100 grams of gold per ton, as is claimed for this reserve by the government, is \u201dinsane\u201d and \u201dextremely optimistic\u201d. Indeed, $12tn exceeds the entire market cap of all gold mined ever.\nIf there was more evidence of the deposits\u2019 existence, they add, it could see the price of gold drop by \u201d50% overnight,\u201d however, echoing White\u2019s sentiment, and highlighting the uncertain future of these vast gold deposits.\n\"The $13tn question: Will Uganda\u2019s newest gold deposit change the face of mining?\" was originally created and published by Mining Technology, a GlobalData owned brand.\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

This is not just a Middle East thing that causes the risk off now.

Look, that makes sense from a risk perspective, but I still think that bonds and equities are more or less still correlated. To me, until we resolve this uncertainty about global inflation, actually bonds and equities will move together. So there's not a lot of diversification. What I'd much rather be doing is looking at a third alternative asset class, which of course would be commodities. Commodities have been a very unloved source of diversification. Now what you're starting to see is that no matter whether interest rates in the U.S. go up or down, gold prices are just going up and that's telling you that there's a rush to the exits to get out of the things which are moving too closely together, like bonds and stocks and maybe credit.\n\"Gold prices have risen despite the stronger U.S. dollar. So what happens when the U.S. dollar eventually goes down? What you'll find is that the U.S. dollar will probably be too expensive and need to come down, in which case gold could get another leg up.\"\nKHOON GOH, HEAD OF ASIA RESEARCH, ANZ, SINGAPORE\n\"Markets have definitely reacted very, very swiftly to the news reports. We've seen a massive risk-off move with gold rallying, oil prices rallying, and traditional risk assets getting sold out hard.

Earlier in March, analysts at Citi called for a 25% probability of gold averaging a record $2,300 per ounce in the second half of the year, according to CNBC.\n\u201cCiti describes gold as a developed market \u2018recession hedge,\u2019 and increasingly sees tailwinds from uncertainty around the U.S. election in November,\u201d CNBC added.\nPeter C. Earle, senior economist at American Institute for Economic Research, noted that gold is a volatile commodity and may at times hit a high \u2014 and then retreat sizably. \u201cAlthough individual financial circumstances may vary, taking a position in a commodity exclusively because it has hit a record high can be hazardous,\u201d said Earle.\nAs he further argued, the gold market responds to uncertainty, and we are swimming in uncertainty right now. \u201cFrom political to economic to social and international affairs, a large number of questionable circumstances must be resolved before clarity can be attained,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the meantime, these are the markets in which gold has earned its reputation for being a safe haven asset.\u201d\nOther experts noted that the timing of this rally amid increasing uncertainty for the future path of the Fed funds rates and the strengthening dollar suggests it might be driven by factors other than interest rate expectations alone. Morgane Delledonne, Global X\u2018s head of investment strategy, Europe, said that if persistent, \u201cthis precious metal rally could be signaling a risk-off shift in investors\u2019 sentiment since it also coincides with a drop in the 10-year Treasury yield since the end of last month.\u201d\nHold 1% to 3% in precious metals\nVijay Marolia, co-founder of The Cash Square stressed that it\u2019s important to remember \u201cthat gold isn\u2019t an investment \u2014 it\u2019s money.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the original money and it can\u2019t be inflated away like fiat currencies,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I recommend people hold at least 1% to 3% of their liquid net worth in precious metals.\u201d\nAccording to Marolia, the best strategy is to dollar-cost-average over time \u2014 which, as he explained, refers to the practice of systematic investing designed to avoid trying to time prices.\nThink long-term\nJoseph Cavatoni, market strategist, North America at World Gold Council, underscored the fact that the tactical, short term move for gold\u2019s price we saw is drawing a lot of attention to the asset from investors. \u201cNow is a good time for investors to evaluate their allocation to gold, however, it\u2019s important to consider not only the tactical drivers surrounding the rate cycle that are driving record highs, but also the longer term, strategic drivers that keep it on this upward trajectory,\u201d he said.\nCavatoni noted that this includes its diversification and risk hedge qualities as we look at an election year and ongoing geopolitical risk, as well as strong central bank buying that has supported gold\u2019s price. \u201cIn the last 20 years, gold outperformed most major asset classes, so rather than timing the market, investors should think about gold\u2019s role in their portfolios in the long-term,\u201d he added.\nNot the best store of value, but a great diversification tool\n\u201cGold hasn\u2019t always been the store of value people hoped it would be,\u201d Doug Boneparth, a certified financial planner and the founder and president of Bone Fide Wealth, told CNBC. Over the last century, gold has risen around just 1% a year, on average.\nFor instance, a $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 on March 5, 2014 would be worth around $32,700 today. Meanwhile, the equivalent investment in gold would have only grown to roughly $14,700, CNBC added, citing Morningstar Direct data.\nAs of March 7, gold was up 4.51% year-to-date, according to MarketWatch. Yet, despite meager returns compared to other assets, gold is a great diversification tool, which can help mitigate risk.\nAs CBC explained, its low correlation to traditional assets such as stocks and bonds, coupled with its historical ability to act as a hedge in times of economic uncertainty, offers an effective means of diversifying your investment portfolio.\n\u201cWhile gold prices can experience short-term fluctuations, the value tends to grow steadily over time. So, if you wait for prices to drop, you could actually end up paying more to buy in and enhance the stability and longevity of your portfolio,\u201d CBS noted.",

Rod Antal, executive chairman, will be joined by Michael Sparks, chief financial officer; and Bill MacNevin, EVP, operations and sustainability, on today's call.\nI will now turn the line over to Rod.\nRod Antal -- Executive Chairman\nGreat. Thanks, Alex, and thanks for everyone for joining us today. I'm going to start today's call with an update on Copler, summarizing the work completed to date in the key areas of focus going forward. We will then provide an update on the third-quarter financial results and operational highlights for Marigold, Seabee, and Puna.\nAt Copler, we've made good progress on the four key priorities since the incident. These have been: first, the recovery of our missing colleagues; two, the containment and remediation of the site; third, the investigation into the root cause of the heap leach failure; and fourth, preparing for the restart of the Copler mine. With respect to our missing colleagues, all nine individuals have been recovered and returned to their families. We are continuing to support the families and the community members impacted by the Copler incident.\nSecond, all of the planned containment infrastructure has been successfully installed and are proving to be effective. Public statements from the Turkish government officials continue to reiterate that there has been no recordable contamination to local soil, water, or air in the sampling locations. In partnership with the Turkish authorities, we have continued to progress the remediation at site. Good progress has been made to date with over 16 million tonnes of the displaced heap leach material moved into temporary storage locations, including substantially all the displaced material from the Sabirli Valley.\nAs part of the remediation work and as previously disclosed, the heap leach pad will be permanently closed and no future heap leach processing will take place at Copler. We are continuing discussions with the Turkish government officials around the final remediation plan, including the approval and construction of the East storage facility, which will permanently close -- which will permanently store all of this displaced material. The Copler remediation and containment work is estimated to cost between $250 million to $300 million and take a total of 24 to 36 months to complete. In the third quarter of 2024, $48 million was spent on remediation activities at Copler, bringing total remediation spend since April 1 to $103 million.\nThird, on the incident investigation. The initial design of the heap leach facility prepared prior to commencing production in 2010 and each subsequent expansion thereafter was engineered, reviewed, and approved by independent third-party engineering firms. Throughout the various stages of construction across the life of the heap leach facility, third-party reviews were also conducted to ensure conformance with underlying engineering design parameters. The investigations into the cause of the Copler incident began shortly after the event.\nWe commissioned independent experts to review the design, construction, and operations of the heap leach facility. To date, this review has not identified any material nonconformance with the construction or operation of the heap leach facility relative to the third-party engineered design parameters. The last point with respect to a potential restart. We continue to work closely with the relevant authorities to advance the required permits for the restart of the Copler mine.\nOnce all regulatory approvals, including the operating permits, are reinstated, it is anticipated that the initial operations at Copler could restart within 20 days from that point. So, now, let's move on to Slide 4, where Michael will discuss the third-quarter results.\nMichael Sparks -- Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Rod, and good afternoon, everyone. Third quarter 2024 production was 97,000 gold equivalent ounces at all-in sustaining costs of $2,065 per ounce, which includes cash care and maintenance costs incurred at both Copler and Seabee, representing approximately $252 an ounce. Seabee was placed into temporary care and maintenance due to forest fires on August 21 and operations were subsequently restarted on October 11. Year to date, Marigold, Seabee, and Puna have combined to produce 249,000 gold equivalent ounces.\nDuring the quarter, we continue to advance brownfield exploration programs at Marigold, Seabee, and Puna, which Bill will discuss later. Additionally, site establishment and engineering activities at Hod Maden continue to progress. On to Slide 5 for a brief look at the financial results. We recorded attributable net income of $0.05 per share in the third quarter, while adjusted net income per share was $0.03, largely reflecting the exclusion of minor tax and foreign exchange gains recorded in the quarter.\nAs a reminder, we do not adjust for care and maintenance costs, and the full impact of these expenses at both Copler and Seabee are included in our adjusted net income. Including the remediation spend at Copler, third quarter cash generated by operating activities was negative $1 million, while free cash flow was negative $34 million. We finished the quarter with $334 million in total cash and a net cash position of $104 million and total liquidity of $834 million. With our existing liquidity and an outlook for improved production and free cash flow generation in the fourth quarter, we remain in a strong position financially and are well-positioned to manage the remediation costs at Copler as well as continue our reinvestment needs across the business.\nOn to Slide 7 to discuss the operations, where Bill will start with Marigold.\nBill MacNevin -- Executive Vice President Operations and Sustainability\nThanks, Michael. Marigold's third-quarter production of 48,000 ounces was in line with expectations. As the 2024 mine plan calls for, the fourth quarter has the lowest production and highest cost of the year. Marigold remains on track to meet its full-year production guidance of 155,000 to 175,000 ounces.\nHowever, we now expect increased full-year costs due predominantly to increased royalty costs and higher-than-expected maintenance component costs. Of the increase to Marigold's AISC guidance, approximately 60% is associated with higher royalty costs resulting from the strong gold price in 2024. We expect both of these cost pressures to persist into 2025. Brownfield exploration and desktop studies at Buffalo Valley advanced during the quarter as we look to continue to replace mine depletion and potentially further expand Marigold's operating life.\nNow, on to Seabee. At Seabee, third quarter production of 10,000 ounces reflected the temporary suspension of operations on August 21 due to forest fires in the vicinity of the mine. Thankfully, none of our employees were injured by these fires and the process plant in Santoy mine were not materially impacted. While some remote equipment, including power poles, piping, and exploration equipment was damaged, operations were fully restarted on October 11.\nDue to the suspension, Seabee's full-year 2024 guidance is now 65,000 to 70,000 ounces at AISC of $1,725 to $1,755 per ounce. Seabee continues to focus on evaluating and drilling near-mine extensions to existing underground mineralization as well as the continued advancement of the Porky and Porky West targets. The Porky targets represent a potential mine life extension opportunity, and the Seabee team is aggressively advancing technical studies to better delineate the opportunity. While the surface drilling program was impacted by forest fires in the third quarter, the vegetation cover cleared by the fires have provided our exploration team with new opportunities to evaluate surface targets in the coming field seasons.\nNow, on to Puna. Puna produced 2.9 million ounces of silver in the third quarter, reflecting a second consecutive quarter of record throughputs for the Pirquitas processing facility. Owing to strong operating results over the last two quarters, Puna is now expected to produce 10 million to 10.5 million ounces of silver in 2024, an increase of more than 1 million ounces of silver on a midpoint basis. While Puna's full-year cost expectations are unchanged, the AISC of $1,537 per ounce in the third quarter demonstrated Puna's significant free cash flow margins in the current silver price environment.\nIn addition, exploration and technical work continues to evaluate opportunities to extend operations at Puna through potential extensions at Chinchillas and continued advancement of the Cortaderas target through near-mine drilling. Now, I'll turn back to Rod for closing remarks.\nRod Antal -- Executive Chairman\nGreat. Thanks, Michael, and thanks, Bill. As I mentioned, we set out four commitments following the Copler incident. These commitments are important milestones in the path toward a potential restart of the operation.\nAnd I mentioned we continue to make good progress on all the fronts. We are looking forward to a strong close to the year at each of Marigold, Seabee, and Puna, and we'll continue to advance opportunities to improve our business through operational excellence, initiatives, and brownfields growth projects as we move into 2025. As Michael mentioned, we have continued to advance Hod Maden, and we expect to provide an update on our anticipated 2025 capital spend at the project with our normal guidance update early next year. To date, our work continues to demonstrate an exceptionally high-quality asset that will be a key contributor to our portfolio going forward.\nSo, with that, I'm going to turn over the call to the operator for any questions you may have. Thank you.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, at this time, we'll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question today comes from Ovais Habib from Scotiabank. Please go ahead with your question.\nOvais Habib -- Analyst\nHi, Rod and SSR team. Just a couple of questions from me. Starting off just on the Copler remediation. You've talked about, obviously, this temporary storage facility right now.\nAnd then obviously, you're going to go to a more permanent storage facility at one point. What kind of -- I mean, in terms of -- you're waiting for, I guess, approvals, what kind of approvals do you need? Are there permits required? Anything else that you need kind of to go forward with that? Any sort of color on that would be appreciated.\nRod Antal -- Executive Chairman\nYe\\ah. Thanks, Ovais. Look, I think the pleasing status of where we are right now from a remediation perspective is the key point is substantially all the materials out of the Sabirli Valley. So, that's really the good news.\nAnd of course, when the incident happened, we didn't have a final sort of design for what the ultimate storage facility would be, and nor did we expect that we'd have to recreate one. So, since that date, we've been in consultation with the government going through the various options that we had to not only locate the permanent storage facility but also define it from an engineering perspective as well as meeting the commitments from the Turkish regulations of what the requirements are for a foreclosure. So, all of that work has been ongoing, Ovais. And the location was chosen, which is good, which is we've termed the storage facility.\nThe engineering has progressed. The discussions are going on with the regulators to ensure that we have met all of the requirements as well. And remember, this will be the first closure of this type in the country. So, we're making sure that we're taking all the right steps.\nAnd once that's all done, the approvals will be forthcoming. So, we do expect that early next year. And then from that point, we'll start the efforts around the construction and then moving the materials in the temporary locations to the permanent one.\nOvais Habib -- Analyst\nAnd just -- thanks for that. And just in terms of the EIA, in terms of -- now you're kind of reverting back, I believe, to the 2012 EIA. And it's kind of talking about 6,000 tonnes per day versus the 9,000 tonnes per day that was in the 2021 EIA. Assuming you get all the necessary approvals to restart, would you be looking at a restart at that 6,000 tonnes per day then versus the 9,000? Just some clarity there.\nRod Antal -- Executive Chairman\nYeah, that's correct, Ovais. I think, look, the cancellation, as we've disclosed, was an administrative appeal in the court. There is efforts going on in the country to appeal those case in conjunction with the appropriate government departments. So, that is continuing in the background.\nBut the default position is back to the 2014 EIA, which limits the throughput rates to 6,000 tonnes per day. So, that will be the assuming all things being equal, as we know it today, that would be the fallback position, and we'll plan on those accordingly. And then in the future, we would -- we have to anyway do an EIA refresh in the future, and that will just accelerate those efforts moving into next year.\nOvais Habib -- Analyst\nThanks for that, Rod. And just last question for me. In terms of any sort of restart over here, with your discussions that you're having with the regulators, does the restart have to wait until all remediation is complete? Or can you restart while the remediation is taking place?\nRod Antal -- Executive Chairman\nIt's not dependent on all of the remediation or other efforts around it. The discussions that we've had and as I sort of mentioned, I think all of the efforts that we've had underway and are currently underway, and some are completed, some are still ongoing at Copler are really a precursor to those conversations. And as you can imagine, actively and continually, there's many levels of government that those conversations are continuing to evolve. So, it's not necessarily all on the condition that we finish all this work, but it helps while we're having those conversations because we're acting out our commitments to make good post the Copler incident, and we'll continue to have the dialogue with the various government departments to ultimately achieve a restart at Copler.\nOvais Habib -- Analyst\nPerfect. Thanks for that, Rod. That's all my questions. Appreciate it.\nThanks, guys.\nOperator\n[Operator instructions] And ladies and gentlemen, I'm showing no additional questions at this time. We'll close today's question-and-answer session, as well as today's conference call.

Low rates tend to be supportive for gold, which bears no interest.\nInvestors are currently pricing in a 55% chance of a 25-basis-point U.S. rate cut and a 45% chance of a 50-bps cut, the CME FedWatch tool showed.\nIf incoming data points to growth risks and weakness in the labor market, it will raise the chance of a 50 bp rate cut in either November or December, which would increase the tailwind for gold and pull forward the timing for attainment of $3,000, said Peter A. Grant, vice president and senior metals strategist at Zaner Metals.\nInterest rate cuts from major central banks are well underway, with the European Central Bank on Thursday delivering its second quarter-point cut of the year.\n\"We're also evaluating other factors stirring up demand from the Western investor, including the upcoming U.S. election arguably adding to the uncertainty and gold serving as a hedge against immediate event risks,\" said Joseph Cavatoni, market strategist at World Gold Council.\nThe upcoming Nov. 5 presidential election could boost gold prices as potential market volatility may drive investors towards safe-haven gold.\nAttaining the $3,000 per ounce target is possible, said Daniel Pavilonis, senior market strategist at RJO Futures, adding that the scenario could be driven by political unrest following elections.\nInvestment banks and analysts have turned increasingly bullish on gold, with Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs showing the highest confidence in near-term upside in gold, which remains its preferred hedge against geopolitical and financial risks.",

The precious metal is famously seen as a \u201csafe haven,\u201d and the general view is that bullion prices should rise when interest rates fall \u2014 which many investors expect will happen later this year.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nThe Odds of $100 Oil Are Rising as Supply Shocks Convulse the Market\nIsrael Backs Out of Khan Younis to Prepare \u2018Future Operations\u2019\nSaudis Scale Back Ambition for $1.5 Trillion Desert Project Neom\nAnd yet. Take a closer look, and it\u2019s far from clear: why is gold suddenly rising right now?\nAfter trading in a fairly steady range for months, bullion started spiking in early March. It\u2019s risen 14% since then and left a string of daily records in its wake. But geopolitical tensions have been high for months, even years, and if anything the outlook for the timing on rate cuts by the Federal Reserve has become muddier in recent weeks. So what\u2019s changed?\nRead: Chinese Buying Set the Stage for Gold\u2019s Latest Record Run\nSeasoned executives and analysts offer very different answers to who or what has driven gold to its unprecedented heights: Is it a central bank worried about the dollar\u2019s role as an economic weapon? Funds betting that the Federal Reserve\u2019s pivot to lower interest rates is imminent? An army of algorithmic traders drawn to gold simply because it\u2019s going up? Stubborn inflation and worries about a hard landing? Weakening currencies? Upcoming elections? All of the above?\nThe mystery has sent industry insiders poking through the plumbing of a massive global trade that stretches across futures and exchange-traded funds from New York to Shanghai to a huge over-the-counter hub in London and world-spanning web of dealers selling bars, coins and jewelry to everyone, everywhere.\nIt\u2019s an opaque and complex world that\u2019s historically been hard to crack open. Still, the market and regulators have been on a years-long drive to boost transparency, increasing access to data that helps shine a little more light on the gravity-defying rally in one of the world\u2019s oldest stores of wealth.\nWho\u2019s buying?\nFirst, the easy answer: Central banks, in particular, as well as big institutions and traders preparing for a shift to looser rates. Chinese consumers are worried about wilting returns in other assets and a depreciating currency. On Reddit Inc.\u2019s platform, self-proclaimed \u201cstackers\u201d boast of hoarding bars and coins.\nBut those groups have been a consistent bullish force for months \u2014 or years in the case of central banks \u2014 and it\u2019s not clear why any one of them might be buying with a much greater sense of fear, greed, or exuberance. Analysts are armed with better market data than they\u2019ve ever had before, and yet the cumulative answer is frustratingly vague: It\u2019s everyone all at once, and no one in particular.\nWhat are they buying?\nOne thing that\u2019s clear is also a head-scratcher: Investors haven\u2019t been buying exchange-traded funds, one of the easiest ways to acquire gold. A steady stream of outflows from gold-backed ETFs suggests that a major cohort is missing out \u2014 or cashing out.\n\u201cThis is one of the more bizarre phenomena that I\u2019ve ever seen in the ETF space,\u201d said Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store. \u201cWhat\u2019s particularly interesting is that gold demand has been very strong in other channels such as central bank purchases and direct purchases by individual and private investors.\u201d\nProfit-taking by long-term investors who bought in years ago is how Citigroup Inc. explains why net ETF inflows have been notably weak. The fact that the steady and sizable outflows haven\u2019t had a greater impact on prices also hints at strong demand for the bars they\u2019ve been selling \u2014 and central banks would be a natural buyer, according to Joe Cavatoni, who oversees the World Gold Council\u2019s ETF platform.\n\u201cThere are other investors who are buying the physical gold, so it is not having an impact in any way,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cGuess where it goes: into the OTC market, picked up by central banks.\u201d\nWhere are they buying?\nIn the larger futures and over-the-counter markets, trading activity is rising sharply, signaling that the usual institutional buyers \u2014 central banks, investment banks, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds \u2014 are involved. Options activity is picking up, too, and there are expectations bullion prices may vault higher still as options dealers rush to cover their exposure.\nThe number of outstanding contracts in New York futures has been rising, a sign that longer-term bets by money managers are on the upswing. But overall trading volume has outpaced the number of open contracts \u2014 hinting at a surge in the kind of frenetic day trading algorithmic funds excel at.\nWhen are they buying?\nMainly on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. The gold market is famously sensitive to shifts in US economic data, and that\u2019s become even more true since prices took off at the start of March. Key economic releases on those days offer readings on the strength of manufacturing, jobs, GDP and inflation, and a concentrated spurt of buying seen after the data provides a strong clue to the identities of the most influential actors.\nBut that in itself has been confounding analysts, because recent data has been coming in hot, and investors in currency and bond markets have been responding with bets that the Fed\u2019s pivot will come later and be shallower than expected a few months ago.\nIn theory, that would be negative for gold because high interest rates dent bullion\u2019s appeal relative to yield-bearing assets such as bonds. Investors also are pushing up the dollar, which has made gold much more expensive for buyers in the top consumer markets: China and India.\nWhy are they buying now?\nThat\u2019s the big question. The glaring hole in the narrative of the past five weeks is that while the Fed is still expected to start cutting rates this year \u2013 which should benefit gold \u2014 many investors have actually become less convinced about the timing than they were a few months ago.\nOne possibility is that some gold investors are instead zeroing in on the prospect of a hard landing in the US economy based on the recent data, and rushing to buy bullion for its role as a haven.\nThat idea could also provide an explanation for another curious movement in the gold market in recent weeks \u2013 the relationship between a closely watched gold price spread and US Fed interest rates.\nThe percentage yield between London spot and three-month forwards \u2013 which tends to track interest rates because of the cost of storing, financing and insuring gold \u2013 has made a rare dip below Fed rates in recent weeks, as spot prices soared. Historically, that only happens on a sustained basis when rates are either low or about to move sharply lower.\nThe inversion of the spread may signal that nervous investors are clamoring to get hold of spot gold now, as protection against potential turmoil.\n\u201cThe rally is defying a lot of normal thinking, especially when it comes to still-elevated rates,\u201d said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank AS. \u201cI think the narrative is changing towards sticky inflation and perhaps a hard landing, spiced with a lot of geopolitical uncertainty and de-globalization driving central bank demand.\u201d\n\u2014With assistance from Eddie Spence, Sybilla Gross and Jack Farchy.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nEveryone Is Rich, No One Is Happy.

Costco has consistently sold out of gold bars when they become available on their website and Wells Fargo estimates that Costco sells up to $200 million in gold bars and silver coins to its members each month.\nIt's been a perfect storm for the yellow metal, and the outlook suggests more gains ahead.\nHere's what's going on.\nDemand from central banks\nGlobal central banks have been on a gold-buying spree over the past few years.\nAccording to the World Gold Council, central banks purchased a record 483 tons of gold in the first half of the year. Central banks from Turkey, India, and China topped the list of the biggest buyers.\nPart of the surge in demand is from countries that want to diversify their holdings away from the US dollar.\n\"We believe that the tripling in central bank purchases since mid-2022 on fears about US financial sanctions and US sovereign debt is structural and will continue,\" Goldman Sachs said in a note last month.\nThis dynamic has been on display since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, as America sought to inflict maximum economic damage on Russia via sanctions. But it's harder to implement sanctions against a country that is less reliant on the dollar, and one way to be less reliant on the dollar is to buy gold.\nIt is a dynamic that the US should be closely monitoring, according to economist Mohamed El-Erian.\nEl-Erian wrote in an op-ed for the FT this week that the persistent rise in gold \"captures an increasingly persistent behavioural trend among China and 'middle power' countries.\"\n\"There is also interest in exploring possible alternatives to the dollar-based payments system that has been at the core of the international architecture for some 80 years.\"\nRussia has had some success with this, as it's managed to navigate its economy away from a full-fledged downturn after the US imposed wide-ranging sanctions in 2022.\nRussia's ability to steer its de-dollarized economy away from a crisis could give other countries confidence to lessen their dependence on the dollar, which ultimately benefits gold.\n\"What is at stake here is not just the erosion of the dollar's dominant role but also a gradual change in the operation of the global system,\" El-Erian said. \"As it develops deeper roots, this risks materially fragmenting the global system and eroding the international influence of the dollar and the US financial system.\nSo when geopolitical tensions rise, investors tend to flock to the shiny metal, and right now, there is no shortage of reasons to be worried.\nFrom Russia's war against Ukraine to the escalating clashes in the Middle East to China's long-running threat against Taiwan's independence, geopolitical tensions are rising, not falling.\nWhat's more, soaring US debt means that Treasurys\u2014another historical safe haven asset\u2014might not be so risk-free anymore.\n\"Gold looks to be the last 'safe haven' asset standing, incentivising traders including central banks to increase exposure,\" Bank of America said in a note this month.\nThat's because a potential Trump presidency is expected to be accompanied by a soaring government deficit and a fast-growing pile of debt, which would further drive concerns about a rebound in inflation and the sustainability of the US dollar.\n\"If you're worried about fiscal profligacy, financial repression, and attacks on Fed independence, gold would be an attractive asset,\" economist Davix Oxley of Capital Economics said on Friday.\nEven if Trump doesn't win the election, the deficit is likely to grow, setting gold up well for more gains, according to Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick.\n\"It's not as though either candidate is preaching fiscal discipline, and the Fed seems willing to keep cutting even if inflation remains a bit above target. So there is a thought that gold could be a viable alternative if rates rise and the economy remains sound. And if the economy isn't sound it could still be a good store of value,\" Sosnick told Business Insider.\"\nInterest rates\nAccording to data from the World Gold Council, falling interest rates have historically benefited gold prices, with the commodity rising as much as 10% in the six months after the Federal Reserve's first rate cut.\nWith the Fed expected to cut interest rates multiple times over the next year, lower rates should serve as a tailwind for gold prices.\nWhile interest rates actually jumped since the Fed's first rate cut last month, with the 10-year Treasury yield hitting its highest level since July this week, gold prices have continued to rise.\nThat's a sign that gold investors are more focused on the global interest-rate path, which is pointing lower as global central banks look poised to loosen monetary policy.\nThe People's Bank of China cut rates by 25 basis points this week, while the Bank of Canada cut by 50 basis points. The European Central lowered rates by 25 basis points last week, and economists say they see the Bank of England set to deliver bigger rate cuts than previously expected by markets.",

Year-on-year crude declines that are depressing headline annual inflation rates across the world are still running close to 20%.\nAs it stands, no OPEC policy change is expected and the group is set to raise output from December by 180,000 bpd monthly. And Saudi Arabia warned oil prices could drop to as low as $50 per barrel if OPEC+ members don't stick to agreed-upon production targets, the Wall Street Journal reported.\nBack stateside, the U.S. east coast port strikes could well distort monthly economic data and inflation readings at a critical time for policymakers - though there are doubts whether any damage would be durable and some of the biggest worries are for already-hobbled European automakers.\nBut there is little doubt the global industrial economy is struggling badly again, judging by the stream of U.S. and global manufacturing surveys for September released on Tuesday.\nJPMorgan's catch-all global factory index is now showing the deepest contraction of worldwide activity this year and just a whisker from its deepest downturn since the aftermath of the 2020 pandemic shock.\nThere were some silver linings in the U.S. readouts, however, which showed improving new orders and a drop in factory input prices to nine-month lows. Along with news of a pick-up in economy-wide job openings in August, the economic 'soft landing' picture holds together nicely.\nIn a big week for labor market data, ADP's private sector payrolls report is due out later on Wednesday, alongside another long list of Federal Reserve speakers.\nAnd despite the geopolitical jolt, interest rate and stock markets have held relatively steady.\nThe S&P 500 fell back less than 1% from record highs on Tuesday and stock futures are off only modestly ahead of Wednesday's bell. The VIX volatility gauge is hovering just under 20, a level it briefly poked above for the first time in three weeks on Tuesday.\nFed futures pricing is virtually unchanged from Monday.\n'Safety' bids in U.S. Treasuries after the Iran attack news have mostly been unwound already - with 10-year yields back just above 3.75% after completing a round-trip from lows just under 3.70% on Tuesday.\nGold prices were flat on Wednesday and didn't even hit new records on Tuesday's developments.\nThe dollar held onto gains, perhaps partly due to safe haven demand, but it was largely against the euro, which is suffering from stepped-up European Central Bank easing speculation.\nWith euro zone inflation swooning below target, European industry contracting and the regional auto sector in deep trouble, economists have rushed to change ECB forecasts over the past week and most do not see another rate cut this month.\nThe market mood around the world on Wednesday was also more circumspect.\nAsia stocks were mostly lower, with Tokyo's Nikkei underperforming with losses of 2%.\nThe yen gave back any tangential safety bid it may have received too, however, with Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda also saying the central bank must be vigilant to fallout from unstable markets and global economic uncertainties before pushing ahead with further interest rate hikes.\nBut with mainland Chinese markets closed for the rest of the week, Hong Kong was the only indicator of ongoing optimism about last week's frantic economic stimulus and the Hang Seng jumped another 6% on Tuesday's reopening there.\nEuropean stocks actually ticked higher again.\nIn company news, Nike withdrew its annual revenue forecast on Tuesday, just as a new CEO is set to take the helm at the sportswear giant that is staring at a holiday season likely to be filled with discounts and weak traffic on its website and mobile apps.\nThat has sent Nike's shares tumbling 6% ahead of Wednesday's open.\nKey developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Wednesday:\n* US September ADP private sector payrolls; Brazil August industrial production\n* OPEC+ ministerial panel meets to review oil policy\n* Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack, St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem, Richmond Fed chief Thomas Barkin, and Fed Board Governor Michelle Bowman all speak; European Central Bank board member Isabel Schnabel speaks\n* German Chancellor Olaf Scholz meets French President Emmanuel Macron in Berlin; British Prime Minister Keir Starmer meets European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Brussels\n* US corporate earnings: Conagra Brands, Levi Strauss, RPM International, NovaGold Resources\n(By Mike Dolan, editing by Gareth Jones; mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com)",

Our operating and financial results were released yesterday afternoon and are available on our website as are our financial statements and MD&A for the three months ended March 31, 2024. On the call with me today are David Strang, Ero's Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer; Makko DeFilippo, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Wayne Drier, Chief Financial Officer. We will be making forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties from which actual results may differ materially. We would refer you to our most recent annual information form available on our website SEDAR and EDGAR for a discussion of the risk factors of our business and their potential impact on future performance. As a reminder and unless otherwise noted, all amounts are in US dollars. I will now pass the call over to David Strang.\nDavid Strang: Thank you, Courtney, and thank you everyone for joining us today. We've had a great start to 2024, driven by the strong execution of our growth strategy coinciding with highly favorable market conditions for copper and gold. During the quarter, copper prices rallied to their highest levels in nearly two years, fueled by rising demand expectations while the supply outlook remains extremely constrained as evidenced by our recent treatment and refining charge negotiations where we locked in two-year TC/RC terms in the low teens on roughly one-third of our projected concentrate production. At the same time, due to macro and geopolitical uncertainty, gold prices hit all-time highs. These positive trends in both copper and gold markets arrive at an opportune time as we are on track to reach our highest annual production levels ever.\nThis includes anticipated contributions from the Tucuma project, which is now approximately 97% complete. I'm also happy to share that commissioning of Tucuma is advancing ahead of schedule and as a result we are narrowing our projected time line for initial production to early Q3 2024. While Makko will delve into more detail on our progress at Tucuma, I want to express my deepest gratitude to our team on the ground, which just marked over five million hours of work completed with zero lost time injuries. This is an incredible achievement and I commend our leadership team at Tucuma for the strong safety culture built over the past two years. As we rapidly approach an important inflection point in our consolidated copper production profile, I'm also pleased to report that our Xavantina operations are on track to deliver record gold production again this year.\nIn fact, during the first quarter, we produced 18,234 ounces, representing an increase of nearly 5,800 ounces or approximately 47%, compared to the first quarter of 2023. This increase is attributable to the successful completion of the NX 60 growth initiative last year, as well as higher than expected gold grades, which averaged over 16 grams per tonne during the period. This performance also resulted in unit operating costs for the quarter that were below our full year guidance. More specifically C1 cash costs averaged $395 per ounce in the quarter versus our 2024 guidance range of $550 to $650 per ounce. And all-in sustaining costs per ounce averaged $797 versus a full year range of $1,050 to $1,150 per ounce. Given the continuation of positive grade reconciliations and additional visibility into mineable grades for the remainder of the quarter from indoor development channel samples, we are raising our 2024 gold production guidance from 55,000 to 60,000 ounces to a range of 60,000 to 65,000 ounces.\nConsequently, we are guiding to the low end of our full-year gold C1 cash cost and all-in sustaining cost guidance. With gold prices continuing to hit all-time highs, we are well positioned to deliver record operating margins and cash flows at Xavantina this year. At our Caraiba operations, our performance during the quarter was largely in line with our expectations. From a strategic execution standpoint, we made good progress at the new external shaft, where we remain unscheduled to reach a projected depth of approximately 600 meters by year-end. Upon our anticipated project completion at the end of 2026, this shaft is expected to reach a depth of over 1.5 kilometers, making it the second deepest shaft in South America. From an operational standpoint, we started to see the positive impact of the recently completed Caraiba mill expansion during the quarter, with tons processed up over 5% compared to Q4 at approximately 853,000 tons.\nThis increase in mill throughput partially offset a planned decrease in mined and processed copper grades that was compounded by delays in underground development during the period. As a result, a higher portion of ore was mined from lower-grade stokes than planned, resulting in average processed copper grades of 1.08% and production of 8,091 tons after recoveries of approximately 88%. At the same time, we benefited from the sale of copper concentrate inventories carried over from the fourth quarter, resulting in copper tons sold being nearly 1,400 tons higher than tons produced during the quarter. With respect to full-year production, we are reaffirming our guidance range of 42,000 to 47,000 tons, with production expected to be weighted towards the second half of the year.\nConversely, copper C1 cash costs, which averaged $2.30 per pound produced during the quarter, are expected to decrease throughout the year due to projected sequential increases in copper grades and production over the next three quarters. As a result, we are reaffirming our full-year cost guidance at Caraiba of $1.80 to $2 per pound. It is worth noting that there is potential for unit costs to improve further as we continue to lock in more favorable concentrate treatment and refining charges than we had assumed in our guidance. Before I pass the call to Makko for a deeper dive into project execution, I will share a few highlights of our first quarter financial performance. As mentioned, we experienced a fortunate culmination of high copper and gold prices, record production operating margins at Xavantina, and the sale of copper concentrate inventories carried over from the last year at Caraiba.\nCollectively, these factors drove solid first quarter cash flow from operations of $17.2 million and adjusted EBITDA of $43.3 million. I'll now hand the call over to Makko, after which Wayne will provide more detail on our first quarter financial results.\nMakko DeFilippo: Thank you and good morning, all. As we turn the corner towards the finish line on the construction phase of the Tucuma Project, I want to reiterate what David said and recognize our site leaders, our operational teams, and our third-party partners at the Tucuma Project for their continued commitment to safety. Since green lighting, the Tucuma Build, our top priority as an organization has been to deliver the project safely. While we have had many successes at Tucuma over the past few years, I speak for all of us here at AERO in saying that our performance on safety is what we are most proud of. Whether looking at our safety record, reaching 97% physical completion this quarter, achieving key commissioning milestones ahead of schedule, or the line-of-sight visibility we now have on our unchanged $310 million capital cost estimate, to put it simply, we are finding a lot to celebrate at Tucuma these days.\nLooking at where we are at in terms of commissioning and production sequencing for the balance of the year, we have continued to make excellent progress towards the start of operations. Following the successful completion and ramp-up of our crushing screening and conveyance systems earlier this year, we have been able to focus all of our attention to the systematic completion of our milling, flotation, and filtration systems in order to commence integrated commissioning. With the recent completion of our freshwater intake system as well as the conclusion of major mechanical and subcomponent commissioning steps throughout the process plant, we expect to initiate integrated commissioning just prior to the end of the quarter. On the mining side at Tucum\u00e3, which is already in full operational mode, our cumulative operational performance remains well ahead of schedule, despite strong rains during the second half of March.\nWe ended Q1 with approximately 36000 tonnes of ore in a run-of-mine stockpile and an additional 160,000 tonnes of stripped ore in the mine ready to be blasted. With the rainy season well behind us, a significant amount of sulphide ore available for processing and new commissioning milestones being reached on a daily basis, we are in an excellent position to achieve first concentrate production in early Q3 and reach commercial production, which we define as 80% of nameplate capacity by the end of the third quarter. At our Cara\u00edba Operations, while the quarter had slightly lower grade mine in process versus our expectations due to development delays in the Pilar Mine, since the beginning of the second quarter we have made strong progress on development and production and we are reaffirming our full year production guidance.\nAs it relates to the construction of the new shaft for the Pilar Mine, also at our Caraiba Operations, shaft sinking continues to progress as planned and we remain on track to achieve our target depth of approximately 600 meters by year-end. In terms of specific milestones on this project, it's worth highlighting that we successfully and safely concluded the second and longest raise bore segment of the shaft at the end of April. At its finished length of approximately 720 meters, the segment has set a new record for the longest raise bore ever completed in Brazil. Underground development and infrastructure installations required for the ore handling system of the shaft including our pressure chamber, conveyance levels. as well as ore and waste silos are progressing on schedule and the project continues to remain on track for shaft handover to operations in Q4 of 2026.\nLastly, we had an incredibly strong start at our Xavantina Operations during the first quarter, which has been well covered by David. If there are any specific questions on the progress at Xavantina, I'll be happy to address those in our management Q&A. I will now turn the call to Wayne to discuss our financial results.\nWayne Drier: Thank you, Makko. As David highlighted, our financial results for the quarter reflected several positive factors. These included rising copper and gold prices, record production and margins at the Xavantina Operations and the sale of copper concentrate inventories carried over from the fourth quarter at the Caraiba Operations. In addition, a favorable move in foreign exchange led to a realized gain on our foreign exchange hedges of $2.1 million that contributed to first quarter cash flows from operations of $17.2 million and adjusted net income attributable to the owners of the company of $16.8 million or $0.16 per share on a diluted basis. Subsequent to quarter end, we elected to take advantage of another favorable move in the exchange rate and added a layer of zero cost collars for the second half of this year with floor and ceiling rates of $5.15 and $5.62 respectively.\nThe real has since strengthened against the US dollar falling back to a rate of approximately $5.05 yesterday. As at the end of last month, the total notional value of our foreign exchange derivative position for the remainder of 2024 including both the zero cost collars and forward contracts was a little over $250 million. These hedges cover nearly all of our real-denominated operating expenses and the majority of our major project capital expenditures for the remainder of the year and have a weighted average floor and ceiling of $5.02 and $5.38 respectively. Of the total hedge program, approximately $65 million is allocated for major project capital expenditures with a weighted average floor and ceiling of $5.10 and $5.23 respectively. The quarter saw a significant decrease in our capital expenditures with standard Tucum\u00e3 quickly winding down as we approach initial production.\nAs a result, we ended the quarter with a total liquidity position of $156.7 million including $51.7 million in cash and cash equivalents plus $105 million of undrawn availability under our senior secured revolving credit facility. We have also entered into a $50 million non-priced copper prepayment facility subsequent to the quarter end. This facility provides cost-effective capital in a favorable physical copper market, particularly in light of persistently higher interest rates. The repayment of this facility is structured over 27 equal monthly installments, of 272 metric tons of copper beginning in October 2024. Should the market value of the copper delivered in any given month exceed $2.1 million, we will receive a repayment for the excess amount.\nI will now pass the call back to David, to share some closing thoughts.\nDavid Strang: Thank you, Wayne and thank you everybody, who joined the call today. Before we proceed to the Q&A session, I want to extend my deepest gratitude to our teams in Brazil and Canada for their continued commitment and hard work in executing on both our operating plan and our organic growth strategy. I look forward to our third quarter earnings call, when I expect to discuss the ramp-up of production underway at Tucuma. Now I will hand the call back to the operator, to open the line for questions, Operator?",

The central bank itself has hinted as much, and an easing of rates would relieve pressure on both the economy and financial system.\nBut Fed officials have also said they need further confirmation inflation is heading sustainably down to their 2% target before acting. A surprisingly strong report on U.S. manufacturing Monday, which showed a return to growth after 16 straight months of contraction, hurt those expectations.\nIt\u2019s the latest evidence of a remarkably resilient U.S. economy. That keeps people employed and corporate profits humming, but it could also add upward pressure on inflation. Progress there has become bumpier recently, with inflation reports this year coming in hotter than expected.",

The company still needs to provide an update on the progress made in the fourth quarter, but it should have exceeded 50% by now.\nOn April 5, 2023, Eldorado successfully secured financing of 680,400 euros ($741,391.06) for the development of the Skouries project, which will be sufficient.\nThe Skouries mine is expected to produce 67 million pounds of copper and 140,000 ounces of gold a year, with an anticipated $217 million in free cash flow over the first five years of operation. Gold and copper production is expected in the second half of 2025. Below are a few data points from the Skouries feasibility study:\nSource: Eldorado Gold Presentation\nProduction snapshot\nEldorado Gold announced it produced 143,166 ounces of gold equivalent in the fourth quarter of 2023, a significant increase from the 128,453 ounces produced in the prior-year quarter and 121,030 ounces in the third quarter of 2023.\nThe company performed well, particularly at the Lamaque Mine, where production reached new highs. The chart below shows a multiyear record for quarterly production.\nAs I said earlier, Lamaque's production increased significantly. In addition, Kisladag and Efemcukuru performed above expectations, while Olympias registered a slightly lower production. The overall output was impressive.\nFor the full year, total gold equivalent production was 485,140 ounces, up 6.90% year over year. Preliminary production met the revised guidance of 475,000 to 495,000 ounces.\nEldorado Gold's primary metal is gold, which accounts for almost 91% of third-quarter total revenue. Its official revenue results for the quarter will be available in February, however. Copper production from the Skouries mine is expected to begin by the end of 2025.\nCommentary per mine\nFor the Olympias Mine, production was 17,882 ounces, compared to 15,435 ounces produced in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 18,848 ounces in the third qurater of 2023. The fourth quarter was slightly down sequentially, but production in 2023 saw record mill throughput.\nProduction at Lamaque increased to 56,619 ounces from 43,821 ounces in the third quarter and 51,349 ounces in the fourth quarter of 2022, reaching a record due to higher grades and mill throughput.\nGold production at the Kisladag Mine rose 24% quarter over quarter to 46,291 ounces due to improved technical components after the successful commissioning of the North Heap Leach.\nGold production, throughput and average gold grade at the Efemcukuru Mine were on target for the fourth quarter with 22,374 ounces produced.\nFourth-quarter analysis\nThe price of gold closed at $2,029.2 on Friday, Jan. 24, up nearly 6% year over year. In contrast, silver and copper did not perform well.\nAccording to Reuters, gold investors anticipate record-high prices by 2024 due to a dovish view of U.S. interest rates, geopolitical risks worldwide and central bank purchases. It said:\n\"On Dec. 4, gold hit a record high of $2,135.40 on bets of U.S. monetary policy easing in early 2024 after a perceived dovish tilt from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, surpassing the previous record scaled in 2020.\"\nJPMorgan predicts a potential rise in gold prices to $2,300 by mid-2024 due to an expected \"breakout rally.\" This projection is based on the assumption that the Federal Reserve may begin rate cuts later in 2024, as it previously indicated in December that three rate cuts could occur in 2024 and another four cuts in 2025.\nIn this probable scenario, gold miners such as Eldorado Gold are well-positioned to benefit from the bullish gold market.\nWhat to expect for the upcoming quarterly results\nWith strong production in the fourth quarter, Eldorado Gold is expected to announce record revenue of an estimated $288 million from metal sales, with an average gold price of $1,990 per ounce. However, the average price may be lower due to extra costs at Olympias.\nAs production increases, the all-in-sustaining costs are expected to decrease and could drop below $1,125 per ounce.\nHowever, due to the high capital expenditure needed to develop Skouries, the free cash flow might not be as positive as originally anticipated. The free cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2023 is predicted to be approximately $15 million.\nFurther, as of the third quarter, the company's cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities summed up to $476.75 million. This amount is expected to increase to approximately $500 million for the most recent quarter. However, the company's total debt is anticipated to rise from $598.16 million in the third quarter to $650 million. With gold trading above $2,000 in 2024, the company will have no problem.\nSumming up\nEldorado Gold is expected to perform well in 2024 due to the likelihood of gold reaching a record-high level. As previously announced, this expectation assumes the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates. However, the company is currently in a consolidation phase, specifically in a triangle pattern, until the end of February.\nDuring this period, it is important to accumulate the stock and trade short-term LIFO for about 50% of your position. It is also recommended to wait for clear indicators of an imminent breakout before moving further.\nTechnical analysis and commentary\nEldorado Gold is forming an ascending triangle pattern, with resistance at $13.50 and support at $12.10.\nThis pattern is considered bullish, indicating the stock's value may increase soon. The resistance level of $13.50 is expected to be reached again more quickly. If the resistance level is crossed, we may see a breakout to $14.25 before the stock returns to $13.50, which will become the new support level. However, the gold price outlook may not be favorable in the short term, with significant fluctuations expected.\nIt may be a good idea to sell approximately 50% of the shares at a trading range of $13.25 to $13.65 (using the LIFO method) and anticipate potential higher resistance at $14.25 in the medium term. In contrast, if the gold price continues to decline, it may be wise to accumulate shares between $12.25 and $11.75, with potential support at $10.60 for a profitable outcome.",

Gold\u2019s 16% rally this year, setting new all-time highs along the way, should bode well for the mining companies, since rising prices help counter the costs of digging up the precious metal. Analysts and investors will be paying close attention to company disclosures on just exactly how much it costs to produce an ounce of gold \u2014 known as all-in sustaining costs \u2014 in light of surging bullion prices. Spot gold swung between gains and losses Monday.\nOil\nUS crude production has been holding at a record high of 13.3 million barrels a day in July despite a steady decline in the number of rigs drilling in the oil patch. The number of American rigs are down nearly 10% since mid-April, sinking to the lowest level since December 2021, according to the Baker Hughes US oil rig count. Higher productivity per new well and using some of the stockpiles of drilled but uncompleted wells is helping boost the nation\u2019s output.\nMaple Syrup\nPancake lovers rejoice! Early signs are pointing to an unprecedented maple syrup harvest this year in Canada \u2014 the world\u2019s biggest supplier by far \u2014 thanks to a record season from Quebec farmers. Quebec, which accounts for 92% of Canadian output, churned out an all-time high of 239 million pounds of the sweet syrup this season, according to the Quebec Maple Syrup Producers, the group that oversees all aspects of the industry in the French-speaking province.\nChemicals\nThe German chemicals industry is struggling to recover from the shock of high energy costs in 2022, which helped drive down capacity utilization to lows not seen since the global financial crisis of 2007-2009, according to data from the industry association VCI. This time around, the recovery is much weaker. While VCI has seen some rebound in recent months, it doesn\u2019t anticipate output to return to levels seen before the energy crisis. Chemicals are made from naphtha and propane, which are crude derivatives, and are used in a range of products from toys and electronics to cars.\nCarbon Capture\nThe US is a global leader in capturing carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 and its lead is only expected to widen thanks to incentives under the Biden administration, according to BloombergNEF. The US is estimated to have the capacity to capture as much as 164 million tons of carbon by 2035 \u2014 almost equal to the next three markets combined. Carbon is captured mainly from natural gas processing and currently used for enhanced oil recovery. The global carbon capture sector attracted more than $11 billion in investments last year \u2014 nearly double 2022 levels \u2014 with the US taking a 25% share.\n--With assistance from Doug Alexander.\n(Corrects carbon capture chart data for 2035 in July 21/22 charticle.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nRetailers Locked Up Their Products\u2014and Broke Shopping in America\nInside GunTube, the YouTube Subculture Linked to the Trump Shooter\nScammers Target Middle East Influencers With Meta\u2019s Own Tools\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

But today, I\u2019ll use data to explain why, even in 2024 \u2014 the third calendar year of the lowest home sales ever (adjusting to the workforce) \u2014 national home prices have not crashed.\nHere are the reasons given why home prices would supposedly crash over the past 13 years:\n2024 \u2013 Higher mortgage rates, higher inventory, sexless men, silver tsunami, credit card debt \u2014 take your pick, it\u2019s all rookie ball\nLadies and gentlemen, these are not housing experts or analysts. I have a rule: don\u2019t listen to anyone on the internet unless they show their name, face, a written 2024 price forecast, five years of home price forecasting, and a working model.\nSo, why haven\u2019t home prices crashed with high mortgage rates this year?\nWell, if history is our guide, it\u2019s rare for home prices to fall in general since 1942. If you take 2007-2011 out of the equation, we have had only one year go negative; that was 1990, and that was only a 1% decline.\nWhen you ask the housing crash addicts why their home-price forecasts don\u2019t work, they usually say we should adjust home prices to inflation, gold prices, or some other silly historical reference that doesn\u2019t apply to modern-day economics. This group is simply a cult, and their X accounts have been wrong for the last 13 years.\nLet\u2019s look at today\u2019s existing home sales report to see if it can explain why home prices haven\u2019t crashed year over year. To get a real price crash, we would need to see a surge of housing inventory and distressed sellers. As you will see below, inventory is growing, but it\u2019s been a calm, healthy rise in 2024, not a flood of houses coming onto the market.\nThe National Association of Realtors\u2018 existing home sales report shows home sales dropped only 1.0% from August to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.84 million in September. Year-over-year, sales are down 3.5%.\n\u201cHome sales have been essentially stuck at around a four-million-unit pace for the past 12 months, but factors usually associated with higher home sales are developing,\u201d said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun. \u201cThere are more inventory choices for consumers, lower mortgage rates than a year ago, and continued job additions to the economy. Perhaps some consumers are hesitating about moving forward with a major expenditure like purchasing a home before the upcoming election.\u201d\nWhere I disagree with Yun is this: We have more inventory because demand has been softer, and we have more new listings this year compared to last. If mortgage rates had trended below 5.75%- 6.25% this year, we would have been growing home sales regardless of the inventory data. Inventory is growing, and home price growth is cooling down from the savagely unhealthy housing market of 2021 and early 2022, but it is not enough to crash home prices nationally.\nBelow are the charts from today\u2019s report. Note: Median sales price data is seasonal. Many people will try to trick you by saying home prices are declining in the second half of the year, but these are just normal seasonal price declines.\nUsing the NAR data, the normal amount of active inventory since 1982 has been between 2 and 2.5 million. In 2007, active inventory spiked to 4 million. Today, it\u2019s only at 1.39 million. With a monthly supply of homes at over four months and getting closer to my target of 1.52-1.93 million for active inventory, the housing market is balanced. We have some supply to buy homes\u2014we lack demand because mortgage rates are too high.\nOkay, but you could ask: If prices follow volume, why haven\u2019t national home prices seen a steep decline? Well, you would need to add distressed sellers into the mix, as we saw from 2007 to 2011, and we simply don\u2019t have that in the data now.\nForeclosure levels are historically low\nAs you can see below, foreclosure and bankruptcy data rose between 2005 to 2008, all before the job loss recession started. Today, foreclosures aren\u2019t even back to pre-COVID-19 levels.\nNo major forced selling happening\nBelow is our data on new listings, showing that 2023 and 2024 will be the lowest new listing periods ever. This data has been trending between 30,000 and 90,000 weekly for the last five years. Compare that to 2009 to 2011, when this data line ran at 250,000 to 400,000 per week. That\u2019s a big difference, folks. The only time in over 80 years that national home prices crashed waswhen new listings data was running three times higher than we\u2019ve seen in the past few years.\nTons of equity this time around\nToday, few people are selling their homes underwater; the percentage of underwater homes is at 1.7%. In addition, the loan-to-value of homes with a mortgage is under 50%, and over 40% of homes in America don\u2019t even have a mortgage. In 2010, when the new listings data was exploding, over 23% of homes in America were underwater.\nI want to keep things very simple: We had one period where national home prices crashed, and to replicate that model, you will need some similar variables, mainly distressed sellers or people forced to sell into a declining marketplace. Some people believed rising mortgage rates over the last two years would automatically mean home prices would crash. History disagrees with this assertion. The data has shown us for decades that we have periods in history where we have had both rising mortgage rates and inventory without home prices crashing.\nAs we can see in today\u2019s existing home sales report, home sales have declined but are not crashing. I discussed this on the HousingWire Daily podcast last year, explaining my housing economic model. For a national home-price crash to happen, you need a terrible economy, major distressed sellers, and no help from the government in assisting American citizens, which means you need a repeat of the Great Recession of 2008. The data above shows that isn\u2019t the case today.",

For example, he pointed to the S&P 500's price-to-earnings ratio and inflation-adjusted Shiller PE ratio, which, excluding past recessions, are both at multi-decade highs, and the benchmark index's historically low dividend yield of 1.35%.\nHe also noted the market's recent gains have been driven by investors' excitement about a handful of stocks like Microsoft and Nvidia, and their hopes that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates later this year \u2014 not fundamentals like rising corporate earnings.\nIndeed, Dietrich compared the immense hype around AI with the internet mania during the dot-com bubble. He also flagged the Buffett Indicator, which has surged to 188% this year \u2014 close to the 200% mark where buying stocks would be \"playing with fire\" in Warren Buffett's view.\nMoreover, the strategist noted the price of gold has jumped about 20% to record highs over the past year. He attributed that to institutional investors buying the haven asset as they expect a \"major correction or stock market crash due to our wildly overvalued stock market and a slowing underling economy.\"\nOn the economic front, Dietrich argued that decades of excessive fiscal spending and artificially low interest rates have staved off a downturn.\nHe predicted rates would remain elevated for years to combat stubborn inflation, and the government would be forced to raise taxes to address its ballooning budget deficit, pulling down the prices of assets like stocks and houses and causing an economic slump.\n\"No one seems to notice that the economy is cooling and there are risks to the economy everywhere,\" he said. \"I still believe there is a strong possibility the economy will go into a mild recession this year.\"\nDietrich noted the S&P 500 typically tumbles by about 36% during a recession, and the index would need to drop 12% from its current level of around 5,450 points to return to its 200-day moving average. Thus, he warned the index could plunge up to 48% to roughly 2,800 points \u2014 its lowest level since the Covid crash in the spring of 2020.",

Additionally, a quarterly report from the China Gold Council showed that demand for bullion fell nearly 6% from the previous year as fears of an economic cooldown in that nation persisted. The People\u2019s Bank of China stopped buying gold in May and June after notching 18 straight months of purchases.\nThe market hopes to find signs of future market stability with Wednesday\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee meeting.\nBy then, policymakers will have had some time to digest reports released last week showing a surprise bump in economic activity in June and a 0.2% rise in the core PCE index last month \u2013 higher than projections of a 0.1% increase. The 12-month core inflation rate remained stuck at 2.6% for a second straight month, above forecasts of 2.5%. The Fed is expected to leave the benchmark interest rate of 5.25%-5.5% unchanged this week, but investors anticipate the easing will come by September.\nOther key reports this week on consumer confidence, the jobs market, U.S. productivity, and manufacturing will help investors determine the health of the economy.",

Mexico Geological Service Bulletin Nr. 37, Mining of the El Oro and Tlapujahua Districts. 1920, T.

With this milestone complete, Lundin Gold will have repaid in full all of its project finance debt only four years after achieving commercial production at Fruta del Norte. Upon closing, the Company will be debt free and have increased exposure to rising gold prices, resulting in increased amounts of free cash flow1 to support capital allocation initiatives, including further growth and shareholder returns.\"\nThe Stream Facility and Offtake were established in 2017 as part of a project financing package to fund the development and construction of Fruta del Norte. The Stream Facility was repayable in variable monthly instalments equivalent to the value of 7.75% of gold production less $408 per oz. and 100% of the silver production less $4.08 per oz. up to a maximum of 350,000 oz. of gold and six million oz. of silver. The Offtake provided Newmont the option to purchase 50% of Fruta del Norte's gold production up to a maximum of 2.5 million ounces at a price based on a defined quotational period. Under the terms of the Stream Facility agreement, Lundin Gold had the option to buy back (i) 50% of the remaining Stream Facility on June 30, 2024 for $150 million and/or (ii) buy back the other 50% of the Stream Facility on June 30, 2026 for $225 million.\nThe negotiated purchase price for the Stream Facility and the Offtake of $330 million is payable in cash, with the first tranche of $180 million due on closing of the transaction which is targeted on June 28, 2024 (the \"Effective Date\"). Payments and deliveries will continue in accordance with the terms of the Stream Facility and Offtake until and including the Effective Date. The final tranche of the purchase price of $150 million is due on or before the end of the third quarter of 2024.\n______________________________ |\n1 See Non-GAAP Financial Measures |\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis news release refers to certain financial measures, such as free cash flow, which are not measures recognized under IFRS and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS.

His actions can have broader economic implications and his decisions could shape future mortgage rates and the overall housing market.\n\"The overall inflation rate is normalizing and the Federal Reserve can move away from its current restrictive monetary policy, which means further cuts to the short-term interest rate in upcoming months,\" Yun told MarketWatch.\nThat could force mortgage rates down.\nThe October consumer price index (CPI) report showed a 2.6% year-over-year increase, with housing costs driving a significant portion of the rise. While this marks a decline from the peak inflation rate of nearly 9% in June 2022, the Fed's suggested target of 2% inflation remains elusive.\nThe Fed's aggressive rate-hiking campaign in 2022 aimed to curb inflation, but it's important to note that mortgage rates aren't directly tied to the federal funds rate. Instead, they track the 10-year Treasury yield, often influenced by market expectations of future Fed actions.\nAs market participants weigh the potential impact of various economic factors, including ongoing geopolitical tensions and fiscal policies, the trajectory of interest rates remains uncertain. This uncertainty could lead to further fluctuations in mortgage rates, making it challenging for homebuyers and refinancers to accurately predict future costs.\nYun suggests that addressing the federal deficit could be a key strategy to mitigate high mortgage rates. While the Federal Reserve is independent, government fiscal policies, such as taxation and spending, can indirectly influence interest rates.\nYun expressed concern about the potential inflationary impact of tariffs and budget deficits. Since tax cuts are likely under President-elect Donald Trump, he emphasized the need for significant spending cuts to control the deficit.\nTrump recently appointed Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to streamline government operations and reduce costs to lead the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency. The initiative, which aims to eliminate bureaucratic hurdles and improve government performance, could contribute to fiscal discipline and, indirectly, impact interest rates.\nThe endeavor\u2019s success, however, will depend on Musk and Ramaswamy\u2019s ability to deliver tangible results within a relatively short time frame. Their appointment has generated significant interest and speculation about the potential economic and financial market implications.\nAnalysts have cast doubt on the potential impact of Musk and Ramaswamy's appointment, noting that Congress holds ultimate authority over the federal budget and often disregards White House proposals.\nDuring his campaign, Trump pledged to lower mortgage rates to 2%, a level last seen during the pandemic. The Federal Reserve slashed its benchmark interest rate at that time in response to economic disruptions caused by widespread closures and suppressed activity.\nYun noted in a Nov. 8 speech at a NAR conference that mortgage rates during Trump's first term averaged around 4%. This historical context contrasts sharply with the high rates that have dominated the housing market in recent years, driven by the Fed's tightening monetary policies to combat inflation.\n\"Are we going to go back to 4%? Per my forecast, unfortunately, we will not,\" Yun said. \"It's more likely that we'll go back to 6%. That will be the new normal, bouncing around 5.5%-6.5%.\"\nDiversify Your Monthly Income Stream With Fractional Real Estate\nWhile Realty Income is undoubtedly a solid choice for investors seeking consistent monthly dividend income, it's important to remember that publicly traded stocks are subject to market volatility. For those looking to diversify their income streams and potentially reduce exposure to market fluctuations, real estate investing through platforms like Arrived is worth considering.",

Bitcoin has surged close to its record high and global stocks are also hitting fresh peaks - but a Wall Street bank is ringing alarm bells about the risk of a bubble.\nJPMorgan\u2019s chief market strategist Marko Kolanovic said he is concerned that there is \u201cfroth building\u201d in markets.\n5 things to start your day\n1) IT chaos and staff exodus threaten Britain\u2019s ability to raise crucial debt | Illegal activity in government bond auctions risks going undetected, a Parliamentary committee has warned\n2) Jaguar Land Rover owner to split off its cars division in EV shift | Tata Motors prepares for a future built around battery-powered vehicles\n3) Issa brothers slash investment at petrol station empire in battle to pay down debts | Billionaires roll out \u2018controlled reduction\u2019 at EG Group to maximise liquidity\n4) Non-dom tax raid risks backfiring on Hunt, warns IFS | New rules threaten to drive away super rich and diminish revenues, says think tank\n5) Ben Marlow: Britain must not bend the knee to China \u2013 despite being on the brink of a death spiral | There are less grubby ways to inject life back into our moribund stock market\nWhat happened overnight\nMost Asian stocks slid as the start of China\u2019s week-long annual session of parliament disappointed investors with its lack of big ticket stimulus plans to prop up the struggling economy.\nThe Chinese government retained last year\u2019s target for economic growth of \u201caround 5pc\u201d for this year, and announced plans to run a budget deficit of 3pc of economic output, down from a revised 3.8pc last year.\nIt also unveiled plans to issue 1 trillion yuan (\u00a3109bn) in special ultra-long term treasury bonds, which are not included in the budget.\nMainland stocks reversed early losses with the blue-chip CSI 300 up about 0.5pc, amid signs of suspected state-backed buying of some exchange-traded funds.\nHowever, that failed to lift other markets in the region with Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng deepening earlier declines to 2.7pc.\nTokyo\u2019s key Nikkei index closed flat after hitting a fresh record the previous day as chip shares trimmed gains.\nThe benchmark Nikkei 225 index was little changed, down 11.60 points to end at 40,097.63, while the broader Topix index climbed 0.5pc, or 13.65 points, to 2,719.93.\nUS shares edged down from their record heights in a quiet Monday on Wall Street.

Gold rose above $2,100 an ounce on Monday, quickly nearing the metal\u2019s $2,135.39 peak.\n\u201cWe still think it could go higher as well,\u201d said Ryan McKay, senior commodity strategist at TD Securities. That\u2019s because some discretionary macro traders are underinvested in the metal \u201crelative to historical norms heading into a Fed cutting cycle.\u201d TD Securities sees gold moving to $2,300 or higher once the Fed starts cutting rates.\nFinancial investors typically start buying gold ahead of rate cuts, since non-yielding assets, like gold and silver, tend to perform well in lower-rate environments. Nearly three in five investors bet the Fed is nearing its first US interest-rate cut since early 2020, swaps markets data show. Although the timing and magnitude of the US central bank\u2019s rate cut path has been unclear, the wider expectation of coming cuts has helped the precious metal largely hold above the key $2,000-an-ounce level since mid-December.\nUnlike other investing trends that come in and out of style \u2014 from SPACs to crypto \u2014 gold has always had a place in many investors\u2019 portfolios, though demand ebbs and flows with external events. In addition to watching for rate cuts, investors typically want to own bullion in times of economic and political uncertainty; a polarizing, upcoming US presidential election and ongoing wars in Ukraine and Gaza certainly fit the bill. Strong physical buying from central banks and investors in Asia has also been a pillar of support.\n\u201cThe bid for gold from sovereign reserve managers is sure to hold strong as Moscow and NATO talk openly about the risk of direct conflict,\u201d said Adrian Ash, director of research at BullionVault. Central-bank demand is helping offset profit-taking by investors looking to cash in on the higher gold prices, he said.\nRobust buying by investors has been reflected in gold exchange-traded funds, with holdings of SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) seeing their first daily inflow in nine trading sessions on Friday, Bloomberg data show. Gold ETFs were the main driver in the precious metal\u2019s rally to a then-all-time high during the pandemic, but higher rates have largely driven away buyers since 2022.\nThe surge in gold buying is especially strong from hedge funds and money managers, who are now in a rush to reestablish bullish wagers on the metal, despite headwinds such as the strength in the US dollar, according to Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank A/S.\nInvestors \u201chave been forced back into the market on the long side,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cThe rebuilding of long positions may take a few days and if gold stays above $2,088 at today\u2019s close, I would expect more buying then.\u201d\nThe latest CFTC data showed hedge fund and money managers boosted their net bullish gold bets to a three-week high as of Feb. 27, helping to pull bullish bets on the haven asset off recent lows.\nSpot gold was up 2% to $ 2,116.30 an ounce as of 3:11 p.m. in New York.

Prices breached December\u2019s record on Tuesday and have jumped to successive daily highs ever since.\nRead: Gold Extends Record Run With $2,200 in Sight After US Jobs Data\nThe rally itself was peculiar: gold tends to spike in response to globe-shaking geopolitical or economic developments, and nothing particularly noteworthy had happened to justify the surge. The sharp climb higher has left many analysts and other market watchers casting around for explanations, from big investment funds taking a renewed interest in gold, to the role of algorithmic traders that follow momentum in the market, fueling volatility.\nBut the reality is that prices didn\u2019t actually have that far to go before hitting record territory. Gold has been trading for months around the $2,000 mark \u2014 a level that would have been viewed as stratospheric just a few years ago, and which was only breached for the first time in 2020 as the global pandemic raged. Even more unusually, prices have traded at such elevated levels despite sky-high real interest rates that are typically bad for gold, which doesn\u2019t pay interest.\nWhy were prices so high in the first place? That\u2019s where China comes in.\nWhile many western investors did indeed dump gold holdings as rates soared last year, global demand was underpinned instead by massive purchases by central banks in emerging market countries, led by China. And regular people are buying too \u2014 consumers in China have been stocking up on coins, bars and jewelry despite the high prices, to protect their wealth against turmoil in the country\u2019s stock market and property sector.\nRead more: Chinese Gold Buying Is Driving a Paradigm Shift in Bullion\n\u201cThe gold market hasn\u2019t been driven by western investors,\u201d said Bernard Dahdah, a commodity analyst at Natixis. \u201cChina, so far this year and through last year has been the engine behind gold prices \u2014 but not necessarily behind this spike.\u201d\nWhile Chinese and other emerging market buying helped set the stage for this week\u2019s records, the focus has turned to investors and their bets on when the Fed will start cutting interest rates. The initial leap higher on March 1 came after disappointing US factory data and a drop in consumer sentiment appeared to bolster the case for cutting. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell\u2019s comments reiterating the likelihood of a cut this year drove further gains, helping to propel prices to fresh records.\nIn the latest sign of funds having helped supercharge the recent rally, fresh data out Friday from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed that money managers were buying strongly in the week through March 5 \u2014 the day when gold jumped through its previous record.\nStill, bullion has far to go to reach its inflation-adjusted peaks set more than a decade ago. Gold has risen more than 600% since the turn of the millennium, though adjusted for inflation it remains below the high of $850 touched in January 1980, equivalent to more than $3,000 in today\u2019s dollars.\nRead More: Gold Just Set a New Record. Here\u2019s What to Watch Next\nThis week\u2019s high offers some echoes with that peak 44 years ago. In 1979, bullion more than doubled in value as the overthrow of the Shah in Iran and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan highlighted the precious metal\u2019s role as a haven asset. This year, attacks by Iran-backed Houthis on Red Sea shipping and Russia\u2019s grinding war in Ukraine are raising geopolitical risks.\n\u201cThe sabre-rattling from Putin, conflict in Ukraine and Gaza, all of that adds to the background noise,\u201d said Adrian Ash, director of research at BullionVault. \u201cThe mood music is bullish for gold now from the safe haven perspective.\u201d\nBut recent gains have still been relatively modest compared with some record-notching rallies of the past. That\u2019s partly because prices were already elevated thanks to buying by central banks seeking to diversify their reserves away from a dependency on the dollar.\nCentral bank demand \u201cputs a buffer on gold,\u201d said Max Belmont, a portfolio manager on the First Eagle Gold Fund, which had $2.3 billion in assets under management at the end of 2023. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not the western central banks that are accumulating, it\u2019s the eastern,\u201d with China the largest buyer in 2023, he said.\nRead More: China Splurges on Gold For a 16th Month as Price Hits Record\nIf Chinese buying has been a pillar of the gold market, Fed policy is likely to remain the key market mover. Signs that a pivot is getting closer have supported gold since mid-February, with traders now pricing in 67% chance of a rate cut in June, a higher probability than early last month. Lower borrowing costs are typically positive for gold, which doesn\u2019t offer the holder any interest.\nThat means US data, including the latest inflation figures due Tuesday, will be closely watched.\nIn the short term, some investors may choose to cash in their recent profits, which would weigh on prices, said BullionVault\u2019s Ash.\nBut overall, the backdrop means the rally could have further to go. And despite the many parallels between the latest record-breaking run and previous gold peaks, the role played by central banks and Asian buying sets it apart.\n\u201cThe current market behavior, characterized by daily record highs, is unprecedented in my experience,\u201d said Alexander Zumpfe, senior trader at German gold refiner Heraeus Group. \u201cThis uniqueness underscores the complexity of the current market dynamics and the variety of factors influencing gold prices.\u201d\n--With assistance from David Marino and Eddie Spence.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow Apple Sank About $1 Billion a Year Into a Car It Never Built\nThe Battle to Unseat the Aeron, the World\u2019s Most Coveted Office Chair\nHow Microsoft\u2019s Bing Helps Maintain Beijing\u2019s Great Firewall\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

Yes, I would have liked to buy... two each, but I've only bought one each.\"\nThe gold price has jumped 13 percent since the start of 2024 and in mid-April it set a record of $2,431.52 per ounce, which equates to about 30 grams.\nFor jewellers, the worst aspect is price volatility because customers track the market and wait for prices to drop before they go shopping.\n- Price knowledge -\nKhan added that most Green Street jewellers are \"working daily\" to calculate their own product prices based upon the morning gold-price fix published by industry body the London Bullion Market Association.\nThis pricing system is essential to the global trade of jewellery, particularly in the world's two biggest markets: China and India.\n\"It's quite normal for an average Asian family to know what the gold price is today... It's like finding out how much is a litre of petrol,\" explained Santilal at Jeram Jewellers.\n\"Everybody knows that, because if you've got a car, you know what a litre goes for. An average Asian family actually knows what the gold price is. So they'll discuss these things in social circles.\"\nTotal gold demand dropped five percent in the first quarter year-on-year as it became too expensive for some, according to data from the World Gold Council. Demand for jewellery declined two percent.\nGreen Street stores specialise in 22-carat gold products, giving each product a shiny distinctive golden hue.\nThis high concentration leaves jewellers exposed to daily fluctuations in the market of the precious commodity, which accounts for 75 percent of the retail price.\nThat is in marked contrast to classic luxury brands like Boucheron, Cartier and Van Cleef, where prestige has much more of an influence.\n- Hidden gem -\nGreen Street's clientele mostly comprise people whose families come from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, as well as nations in the Middle East.\nPureJewels, another shop on Green Street, specialises in more top-end products that have relatively high design and manufacturing costs.\nBoss Jayant Raniga tweaks his prices each month because his brand of products are less exposed to the gold market.\n\"We were getting a bit worried in April when the price did hit that peak... but overall customers were appreciative of the stability we were providing as a brand.\n\"And it didn't really affect our overall volume.\"\n\"Green Street has become the destination shopping for customers who are wanting to do their wedding shopping of South Asian style,\" he told AFP, adding it was a \"hidden gem\" of the British capital.\nemb/rfj/phz/rl",

In parallel with this, the Company continues to move its development studies forward, with the near-term goal of releasing a Preliminary Economic Assessment by the end of Q2 2024.\nTable 1 - Significant intersects\nHole ID\nBlock\nFrom\nTo\nDownhole Interval\nAu Grade\nGrade x Downhole Interval\nCutoff **\n(m)\n(m)\n(m)\n(g/t)\n(gm/t)\n(Au g/t)\nOKWD24-375\n6\n31.5\n91.9\n60.4\n1.50\n91\n0.3\ninc.\n58.3\n64.3\n6.0\n7.06\n42\n1.5\ninc.\n68.3\n76.6\n8.3\n2.32\n19\n1.5\nOKWD24-376\n6\n124.2\n208.1\n83.9\n0.67\n56\n0.3\ninc.\n181.7\n189.3\n7.6\n1.87\n14\n1.5\nOKWD24-381\n6\n85.2\n130.0\n44.9\n2.28\n102\n0.3\ninc.\n106.9\n125.1\n18.3\n4.38\n80\n1.5\nOKWD24-383\n6\n16.1\n27.0\n10.9\n0.96\n11\n0.3\nOKWD24-383\n67.0\n133.5\n66.5\n0.40\n26\n0.3\ninc.\n67.0\n71.0\n4.0\n1.88\n8\n1.5\nOKWD24-385\n6\n137.0\n149.0\n12.0\n0.80\n10\n0.3\nOKWD24-385\n174.0\n306.9\n132.9\n0.79\n104\n0.3\ninc.\n224.0\n231.0\n7.0\n4.85\n34\n1.5\nOKWD24-388\n6\n124.2\n164.1\n39.9\n1.39\n55\n0.3\ninc.\n132.4\n137.4\n5.0\n5.76\n29\n1.5\nOKWD24-389\n6\n61.0\n73.8\n12.8\n0.38\n5\n0.3\nOKWD24-389\n150.0\n171.6\n21.6\n4.00\n86\n0.3\ninc.\n156.5\n160.5\n4.0\n17.67\n71\n1.5\nOKWD24-391\n6\n107.0\n121.2\n14.2\n0.46\n6\n0.3\nOKWD24-391\n199.4\n257.0\n57.6\n1.29\n74\n0.3\ninc.\n207.7\n211.3\n3.6\n2.45\n9\n1.5\ninc.\n227.0\n233.0\n6.0\n2.62\n16\n1.5\ninc.\n248.9\n254.8\n6.0\n3.61\n21\n1.5\nQualified Persons\nJustin van der Toorn, CGeol FGS, EurGeol, the Company\u2019s Vice President Exploration and a \u201cqualified person\u201d under NI 43-101, has also reviewed and approved the scientific and technical information contained in this news release.\nAbout Reunion Gold Corporation\nReunion Gold Corporation is a leading gold explorer in the Guiana Shield, South America.

Starting the US trading week at roughly $2440/oz, the yellow metal went on to move sharply but steadily higher throughout the entire session, moving beyond $2460 by the commodities markets\u2019 close and then peaking at a new high above $2475 in the second half of Asia\u2019s Tuesday hours. European traders would grab some profits off the top, but only enough to push spot prices into a still eye-watering band between $2465-70/oz, within which the metal traded until Wednesday morning. Importantly, what appeared to drive this aggressive jump-start for gold was a dramatic repricing of not just expectations for an earlier rate cut by the Fed but of the possibility of an \u201cemergency cut\u201d of 0.50% in September (double the \u201ctypical\u201d increment) in order to juice economic growth.\nThe pivot point was, as anticipated, Wednesday\u2019s Consumer Price Index update, which reported a modest (but not insignificant) decline in \u201ccore inflation\u201d on an annualized basis. Crucially for the kind of headlines that often drive market sentiment and trade volatility, the overall year-over-year inflation number also slowed by 0.1%, but this moved the top-line number below 3%\u2014 a major psychological level\u2014 for the first time since mid-2021. Broadly speaking, this presents an argument for the Fed to move closer to cutting rates as inflation (the reason for having hiked rates in the first place) moves closer to the \u201ctarget\u201d of 2%. Gold prices had been bid higher to $2475 just prior to the CPI report; with the inflation numbers proving those bets to be correct, spot held along that level. However, as trading ramped up for the US\u2019 Wednesday session, we saw an unexpectedly sharp fall in gold of $10/oz initial; from there, the yellow metal fell throughout the day in an inverse replay of Monday\u2019s rally before support stepped in and the end-of-day chart steadied just below $2440.",

Those efforts included a failed bid for Toronto-based Yamana Gold Inc. two years ago.\nThe Johannesburg-listed company will use cash to purchase all outstanding shares in Osisko at a price of C$4.90 apiece, Gold Fields said in a statement Monday. That represents a 66.7% premium to Osisko\u2019s closing price on Friday, according to Bloomberg\u2019s calculations.\nGold Fields\u2019 shares declined 3.3% by 1:51 p.m. in Johannesburg.\nThe deal hands Gold Fields full ownership of the Windfall project in Quebec, currently a 50:50 joint venture with Osisko. Gold Fields \u2014 which disposed of all but one of its South African assets a decade ago \u2014 is developing the Canadian mine to add to operations that also span Africa, Australia and South America.\n\u201cThis is a world-class asset in a fantastic jurisdiction,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Mike Fraser said in an interview. \u201cBeing in outright control makes a whole lot of strategic sense for us.\u201d\nGold Fields aims to bring the mine into production in late 2026 or early 2027 before ramping up to around 300,000 ounces a year, he said. Alongside the recently commissioned Salares Norte project in Chile, Windfall is a key part of the firm\u2019s growth plans as it seeks to replace output from maturer assets in Ghana and Peru.\nOsisko\u2019s board has unanimously recommended shareholders vote in favor of the deal, which Gold Fields expects to be finalized in the last quarter of the year. The acquisition will be funded via new and existing debt facilities as well as cash reserves.\nGold Fields has shifted away from its base in South Africa, where producers face the challenges of extracting gold from the world\u2019s deepest mines. In the first quarter of this year, the company\u2019s gold production fell 18% due to weather-related events and operational challenges across its portfolio.\nThe Osisko deal comes with gold trading near a record high, which has spurred producers to add more assets.\n\u201cGold Fields doesn\u2019t necessarily need to go out and do these massive big transformational deals,\u201d Fraser said.

Additionally, construction has commenced at the Bayan Khundii gold project, and exploration efforts across the Khundii Minerals District have yielded continued success.\nAkerley emphasized that the Bayan Khundii gold mine represents one of the highest-grade open-pit gold mines under development globally and is poised to become Mongolia's largest primary gold producer upon reaching full production. With early works completed, project finance secured, and long-lead orders arriving on-site, Erdene remains on track to produce first gold at Bayan Khundii in the second quarter of 2025.\nFurthermore, Akerley shared key findings from the Bayan Khundii NI 43-101 Feasibility Study Update, which outlined a robust economic case for the project. The study reported a base case after-tax NPV5% of US$170 million and an internal rate of return (IRR) of 35%, increasing to US$223 million and 42%, respectively, at a gold price of US$2,000/oz. Total recovered gold is estimated at 476,000 ounces, representing a 25% increase compared to the 2020 feasibility study, with an average gold recovery rate of 93%. The all-in sustaining cost is projected at US$869 per ounce, with upfront capital costs of US$88 million plus a 12% contingency and pre-production costs of US$2 million. These findings underscore the project's strong economics and its potential to deliver significant value to stakeholders.\nContact Details\nProactive North America\nProactive North America\n+1 604-688-8158\nNA-editorial@proactiveinvestors.com\nView source version on newsdirect.com: https://newsdirect.com/news/erdene-resource-development-corp-makes-big-strides-at-bayan-khundii-project-in-pivotal-year-406582529",

The review was conducted by Perth based specialist geoscientist group Southern Geoscience Consultants (SGC) and focused on reprocessing historical airborne magnetic and radiometric data. Significantly, this work defined several tectono-stratigraphic blocks with distinct magnetic and radiometric signatures, confirming that epithermal gold and porphyry-style gold-copper (and associated breccias) are valid exploration targets. Interpretation of geophysical data has for the first time identified several high value exploration targets which have never been drill tested, some of which have associated significant copper gold mineralization in historical surface rock samples (see Figures 1 and 2).\nCEO Statement:\n\"We are excited with the outcomes of the geophysical review for Feni Island,\" said Tim Crossley, CEO of Adyton Resources. \"The integration of historical data with modern geophysical techniques has significantly enhanced our understanding of the project's potential. The identification of new targets and the refinement of existing ones position us strongly for the next phase of exploration. We are confident that Feni Island has the potential to become a major gold-copper discovery, and we are eager to advance our exploration efforts.\" Mr Crossley went on to say, \"if you look beyond the exploration potential and think about project development, we really like the ease of access an island location gives us as well as having both Simberi and Lihir (both world class island operations nearby) providing an existing development blueprint\".\nAdyton Chief Geologist and Director Dr Chris Wilson, BSc (Hons), PhD comments: \"reprocessing of historical airborne magnetic data, in conjunction with integration of other historical datasets, has provided significant clarity with respect to the magmatic and tectonic evolution of Feni and thus mineral deposit target type. Magnetic signatures define: 1) a central graben or down-faulted corridor with low magnetic response that hosts the Ambitle Crater; and, 2) an area of approximately 20 km2 of broadly elevated magnetic response with structurally controlled areas of subdued magnetic response. These signatures are consistent with an intrusive complex defined by multiple intrusive events, some of which have been magnetite destructive. The gold-copper Kabang Prospect is part of this under-explored complex\".\nHighlights of the Geophysical Review:\nAdvanced Data Processing: SGC re-processed and re-modelled historical magnetic and radiometric data. The use of a proprietary processing algorithm and RTP grids with MVI inversion has resulted in significantly improved geological interpretations, particularly in handling low latitude effects and remanent bodies.\nComprehensive Data Integration: SGC integrated airborne magnetic data, radar DTM, and induced polarization (IP) data, into a single 3D project. This compilation allows for detailed 3D analysis and provides a better understanding of the spatial relationship between anomalous gold and copper values and key magnetic, radiometric and IP signatures.\nHistorical Data Digitization: Key geological maps and sections from previous studies were digitized and georeferenced, ensuring that key controls on mineralization were placed in the broader context of mineral deposit development, structural architecture and tectono-stratigraphic evolution.\nPorphyry and Epithermal Gold-Copper Potential: The report outlines the geophysical characteristics of porphyry and epithermal deposits, emphasizing Feni Island's potential to host significant mineralization. The combination of magnetic, radiometric, and IP data points to several high-priority exploration targets.\nMagnetic High Terrane (Intrusive Complex with Copper-Gold Mineralization)\nThe newly re-processed geophysics has for the first time highlighted that the southwest of the island comprises an intrusive complex which is characterized by multiple intrusive events, some of which have been magnetic destructive (see Figures 1 and 2). The Kabang Prospect with an Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate of 1.46 Moz Au1 is located at the northern boundary of this complex in an area of relatively subdued magnetic response between intrusive stocks with higher magnetic response. This geophysical signature has analogies to the Simberi Deposit in PNG and is characteristic of copper-gold epithermal/porphyry systems worldwide.\n___________ | |\n1 | The Feni Island Project currently has a mineral resource prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 \u2013 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects NI 43-101 dated October 14, 2021, which has outlined an initial inferred mineral resource of 60.4 million tonnes at an average grade of 0.75 g/t Au, for contained gold of 1,460,000 ounces, assuming a cut-off grade of 0.5 g/t Au. See the NI 43-101 technical report entitled \"NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Feni Gold-Copper Property, New Ireland Province, Papua New Guinea\" (the \"Feni Technical Report\") dated October 14, 2021 and prepared for Adyton Resources by Mark Berry (MAIG), Simon Tear (MIGI PGeo), Matthew White (MAIG) and Andy Thomas (MAIG), each an independent mining consultant and \"qualified person\" as defined in NI 43-101, available under Adyton's profile on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and have not demonstrated economic viability. |\nHistorical Drilling \u2013 Modern Implications\nHistorical drilling on Feni Island was conducted by several companies over multiple campaigns and typically comprised shallow vertical drillholes that focused on prospects within the Ambitle Crater. Most historical drilling was not assayed for copper. More recent drilling by Adyton targeted the Kabang Prospect and comprised five angled diamond drill holes that were assayed for gold, copper and a multi-element suite. Intercepts from these holes were previously reported (see TSXV Announcement 01 December 2021: Adyton hits significant copper at Feni Island 6.4m @ 5.1% Cu (including 3.6m @ 6.9% Cu)) and included intercepts such as 84.1 m @ 1.0 g/t Au (72 m -156.1 m) including 35.9 m 0.3% Cu and 1.1 g/t Au (70.7 m -106.6 m) and 6.4 m @ 5.1% Cu & 1.6 g/t Au (149.7 to 156.1 m downhole in ADK004). Adyton hole ADK 004 was significant as it confirmed continuity of copper mineralization (noted on slide 14 of the Company Presentation as presented at The Mining Investment Event of the North, Quebec City on the 5th of June and available on the Company web site) that had been identified in three previous exploration programs including, KAD - 001 57 m @ 1.1 g/t Au incl. 55m 0.4% Cu, AMD - 002 114m @ 1.1 g/t Au incl.21.3 m @2.0 g/t Au and 10.2 m @ 0.5% Cu, MAD - 005 284m @ 0.7 g/t Au incl. 48m @1.5 g/t Au and 72 m 0.3% Cu.\nThe Adyton drill program was significant for several reasons:\n1) | The historical resource was modelled using gold assays only, despite the presence of visible chalcopyrite in core. Drilling by Adyton confirmed the presence of copper-gold mineralization. This has significant implications with respect to gold equivalent grades and upgrading the overall resource size and grade. |\n2) | A small number of historical surface rock samples were collected from drainages to the south of Kabang within the recently identified intrusive complex. Whilst Adyton has not been able to verify these rock assay results, considers them historical, and cautions that they should not be relied upon, they suggest that porphyry-style copper gold mineralization may be more extensive than previously reported. |\n3) | The magnetic high terrane to the south of Kabang has never been effectively explored, despite the likelihood that there are several intrusive events evident from magnetic highs, with surrounding magnetic low response implying magnetite-destructive alteration (typical of a porphyry related mineralized system), and significantly anomalous surface rock copper-gold assay results. |\nAdyton is planning an aggressive field mapping and sampling program within and around this intrusive complex, and at additional target areas, with an emphasis on defining additional copper-gold targets.\nKabang Deposit and Mineral Resource Estimate\nHistorical drilling on Feni was conducted over several campaigns and primarily targeted the near surface gold potential through shallow vertical holes. In general, drill core was not assayed for copper. Adyton drilled five angled diamond drill holes at Kabang which demonstrated the depth potential and the close association of copper and gold mineralization.\nMineralization at Kabang occurs coincident with a broadly south-southeast trending moderate magnetic response bounded by a higher magnetic response. This is typical of porphyry mineralized systems worldwide. Significantly, the Kabang deposit is at the southern edge of this corridor, which is untested along strike (and to depth) to the south-southeast, and likewise to the north-northwest, and along related structures trending to the south-west \u2013 in combination, multiple kilometers of untested structures now identified (see Figure 3).\nThe assay results from the Adyton drilling have significant implications for the size and grade of a gold equivalent mineral resource estimate. Drilling by Adyton has: 1) highlighted that historical drill holes were too shallow to effectively test the Kabang system; and, that 2) mineralization is open both along strike and down dip (see Figures 4 and 5). The drill results from the Adyton holes have not yet been integrated into the current Mineral Resource Estimate \u2013 but given the length and grade of intercepts, and their spatial occurrence near and within the current block model, they are likely to have a positive impact on the resource.\nCopper-gold mineralization at Kabang is open in all directions and detailed mapping and sampling of this area is also planned (see Figurs 3, 4 and 5).\nCentral Magnetic Low and Natong (Epithermal Gold)\nThe magnetic response of the central magnetic low (which hosts the Ambitle Crater) and the Natong area to the southeast of the Island is more consistent with low-sulphidation style epithermal mineralization. SGC is currently fine tuning the re-processing of historical data for these areas, to better define structure. The company will be reporting these results shortly.\nFergusson Island Update\nPlanning works continue with East Vision International Holdings Pte Ltd. pursuant to its Investment and Development Agreement with Adyton with a target date of late Q3 / early Q4 to be mobilized on the island to commence infill drilling, drilling samples for metallurgical test works, and bulk sampling works - all of which will inform the Feasibility Study and Mining Lease application.

They proposed a bold solution: slap a hefty tax on Bitcoin or outright ban it.\nAccording to them, Bitcoin creates serious challenges for governments, particularly when maintaining a \u201cpermanent primary deficit\u201d \u2013 a situation where government spending always exceeds its revenue without factoring in interest payments on debt.\nDon't Miss:\n-\nGroundbreaking trading app with a \u2018Buy-Now-Pay-Later' feature for stocks tackles the $644 billion margin lending market \u2013 here\u2019s how to get equity in it with just $100\n-\n\u2018Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones \u2013 invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\nIn their paper, the analyst claims that Bitcoin, being a decentralized digital currency, competes with government-issued securities, making it harder for governments to manage their finances.\n\"A legal prohibition against Bitcoin can restore unique implementation of permanent primary deficits and so can a tax on Bitcoin,\" they argue. That's a mouthful, but essentially, they're saying Bitcoin's very existence forces governments to face fiscal realities they\u2019d rather avoid. It's like tugging a leaky boat while the waves keep crashing in.\nSee Also: Over the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83% \u2014 Investors like Bill O\u2019Reilly and Rudy Giuliani are using this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence.\nAs of 2024, the U.S. primary deficit is $1.8 trillion and the national debt is a staggering $35.7 trillion. The researchers suggest this deficit can be sustained indefinitely \u2013 so long as something like Bitcoin doesn't mess up the balance. The paper describes Bitcoin as \u201cuseless pieces of paper,\u201d given that it's not backed by any real resources.\nWhile government securities aren't tangible, they influence nominal interest rates, which governments can control via monetary policy. Conversely, Bitcoin is like an unruly guest at a carefully planned dinner, throwing the whole event off-kilter.",

Meanwhile, the Brazilian real came under pressure ahead of an imminent central bank rate decision. In monetary policy news, Federal Reserve officials reiterated a patient stance on potential interest rate adjustments, highlighting the need for sustained evidence of easing inflationary pressures. Fed Governor Adriana Kugler suggested that a rate cut could be appropriate \"sometime later this year,\" contingent upon economic developments aligning with expectations. St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of data confirming a conducive economic environment over multiple quarters.\nTurning to commodities, oil prices retreated from recent highs as reports indicated a build-up in US crude inventories, dampening optimism despite ongoing strength in equity markets. Brent crude declined towards $85 per barrel after earlier touching its highest level since early May, while West Texas Intermediate held steady above $81 per barrel. The American Petroleum Institute's data pointed to a third consecutive weekly increase in US crude stockpiles, with additional rises noted at major storage facilities like Cushing, Oklahoma. Overall, market participants navigate a landscape characterized by cautious optimism amid lingering uncertainties. The focus remains on economic data releases and geopolitical developments, which are expected to provide clarity and direction for global markets in the days ahead.\nU.S. retail sales in May showed marginal growth, with the Commerce Department reporting a modest 0.1% increase, which was downwardly revised from April's figures. This subdued uptick suggests that economic activity in the second quarter remained lackluster. Analysts caution that the reported slowdown in retail sales might be somewhat exaggerated due to lower gasoline prices, which dragged down receipts at service stations. According to Reuters, the broader economic landscape is being shaped by persistent inflationary pressures and rising interest rates, factors that are increasingly influencing consumer behavior. Many households are focusing on essential purchases while scaling back on non-essential spending, reflecting a cautious approach amidst economic uncertainties. Economists view the tepid retail sales data as bolstering the case for a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September, despite the central bank's recent decision to delay rate adjustments until later in the year.\nIn contrast to the subdued retail sector, manufacturing production surged 0.9% in May, rebounding strongly from April's decline. This uptick in manufacturing output, particularly in durable goods and nondurable goods sectors, signals a potential revival in industrial activity. However, economists remain cautious about the sustainability of this recovery, citing concerns over high interest rates dampening business investment and a strong U.S. dollar limiting demand for manufactured goods in global markets. Overall, while retail sales paint a cautious consumer spending picture, the rebound in manufacturing production offers a glimmer of optimism for economic growth in the coming months, albeit amidst a backdrop of ongoing uncertainties and policy considerations by the Federal Reserve.\nThe Bank of England is poised to maintain its current interest rates despite headline inflation hitting the targeted 2% mark, marking a significant achievement not seen in nearly three years. Traders are increasingly convinced that an immediate rate cut is unlikely, with only a minimal 5% probability priced into money markets for a reduction during Thursday\u2019s BOE meeting, down from earlier forecasts. Anticipation for an August rate cut has also eased to around 30%. While the 2% inflation milestone is noteworthy, driven largely by declining energy prices, market attention remains on services inflation, which exceeded expectations at 5.7%. Core inflation, excluding volatile components like energy and food, remained elevated at 3.5%, well above the central bank\u2019s preferred target. James Sproule, chief economist at Handelsbanken, emphasized that while recent seasonal factors have contributed to easing food prices, the outlook for the rest of the year suggests potential inflationary pressures could re-emerge, especially in services inflation linked closely to wage dynamics. The Bank of England, keeping a watchful eye on economic indicators amidst an impending national election, faces a delicate decision on future rate cuts. Despite encouraging inflation readings, concerns persist over stubbornly high wage growth, which stood at 6% excluding bonuses in June, complicating monetary policy decisions. Looking ahead, analysts speculate whether the BOE will opt for a rate adjustment in August or September, closely monitoring liquidity conditions and any shifts in economic sentiment post-election. Governor Andrew Bailey\u2019s recent comments suggest a cautious optimism in the central bank\u2019s inflation forecasts, aligning with a similar stance taken by the European Central Bank in its recent policy adjustments.\nWe listed 10 companies that were upgraded by analysts and ranked them by the change in their market prices. Positive changes signal that the market participants agree with the analysts\u2019 assessment.\nA gold mine entry with a conveyor belt transporting minerals from the depths of a shaft.\nOn June 17, UBS analyst Daniel Major upgraded Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), a leading company in the mining industry, from \"Neutral\" to \"Buy\", raising the price target from $40 to $50. This upgrade is based on Major's bullish outlook on gold prices, which he forecasts to be about 30% higher than the current consensus for 2025. This positive outlook is expected to result in consensus earnings upgrades, with UBS's estimated EBITDA for Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) in 2025 being over 30% higher than market expectations. The upgrade follows a period of underperformance by Newmont Mining, which has lagged behind both the gold price and its peers by around 60% since 2019. This underperformance was largely due to Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) historical challenges in meeting its own guidance. However, UBS now believes that Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) guidance is achievable, potentially generating positive operational momentum and shifting the currently skeptical investor sentiment. Additionally, UBS anticipates that Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) will undertake significant divestments, estimated between $2 billion to $4 billion over the next 12 months. These sales are expected to expedite the company's deleveraging process and enhance cash returns to shareholders. Strategically, these divestments will help streamline Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) operations, positioning it with one of the most attractive portfolios in the industry. Post-divestment, Newmont is expected to have predominantly large, long-life assets in low-risk jurisdictions, along with appealing brownfield growth projects. Following the upgrade, Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) stock price rose by 2.15%, indicating a positive market reaction to the improved outlook and strategic initiatives highlighted by UBS.\nOverall NEM ranks 4th on our list of the stocks that are receiving a massive vote of approval from Wall Street Analysts. You can visit 10 Stocks Receiving a Massive Vote of Approval From Wall Street Analyststo see the other analyst-approved stocks that are on hedge funds\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of NEM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Schedule a FREE consultation to see if you qualify for tax relief.\nGold as a Portfolio Diversifier\nGold and silver also offer portfolio diversification and protection during stock market turmoil. When stocks and other risk assets sell-off, the prices of gold and silver often rise. For example, during the Great Recession of 2008-2009, the S&P 500 plunged over 50% while gold prices nearly doubled. Precious metals can help smooth out returns over a long enough period of time. And unlike paper assets, gold and silver cannot go to zero.\n\u201cGold, unlike traditional stocks and bonds, behaves independently, providing a hedge against market fluctuations,\u201d said Peter J. Klein.\nMany investing experts recommend holding some gold as part of a diversified portfolio. Gold and silver have unique properties that make them an attractive asset for managing long-term wealth across generations.\nRead: 7 Key Signs You\u2019ve Reached Financial Freedom\nThis means that gold and silver should not be used for short-term speculation.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t buy gold to get rich,\u201d said Frank Giustra. \u201cIt\u2019s a long-term store of value. You should have at least 10% of your portfolio in gold. If you want higher returns from investing in gold, take more risk and buy gold mining stocks. The gold miners are the cheapest I have ever seen when compared to the gold price. There is great value out there.\u201d\nGiustra added, \u201cGold is one of the best-performing asset classes, if not the best, in the last 50 years. Between 1971 and 2022, gold had average annual returns of 7.78%, which was only slightly behind the return of commodities, with 8.3% average annual returns. Between 2000 and 2022, a gold investment would have yielded over 500% return versus the S&P at 300%.\u201d",

        "full_text": "Harmony Gold Mining Company Limited (NYSE:HMY) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript February 28, 2024\nHarmony Gold Mining Company Limited isn\u2019t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\nPeter Steenkamp: Good morning or good afternoon, wherever you may be across the world. I am Peter Steenkamp, CEO of Harmony. Thank you for joining us virtually today as we present our Interim Results for the Half Year Ended 31st of December 2023 for the current reporting period. Please take note of our safe statement. Let me begin with a summary to remind you who we are and what our strategy is. Harmony is a specialized gold producer with a growing international copper footprint. We also produce small amounts of silver and uranium. We have over 73 years of gold mining experience in South Africa and have been operating for over two decades in Papua New Guinea. Our strategy is aimed at producing safe, profitable ounces and improving margins through operational excellence and value-adaptive acquisitions.\nOur mineral resources and mineral reserves declaration of 138 million ounces and 39 million ounces respectively, presents an incredible opportunity to convert the quality ounces into shared value for our shareholders and stakeholders. Our gold tailings re-treatment business or recycling as you may know it, is the largest globally and is set to grow supporting the circular economy. The Tier 1 Moafie Gold Project in Papua New Guinea and Eva Copper in Australia give Harmony a sizable copper gold footprint, which will be transformational. Currently, our diversified portfolio of operating assets including nine underground mines, two open pit mines, and a significant failings re-treatment business. Production comes from four business areas, namely our South African high-grade underground mines, our South African optimized underground mines, a large and growing surface sources business in South Africa, and a growing international copper gold portfolio, of which Hidden Valley is the only producing mine at this stage.\nMining with purpose ensures that our stakeholders share in the benefits of the minerals we extract. In our presentation today, we will provide further insights in how we are creating long term value, shared value for all of us. Over the past few years, we have set ourselves ambitious goals, and I'm proud to say that we've largely achieved them. Reflecting on the first half of the financial year of 2024, we have delivered significant improvement in safety with our last time injury frequency rate improving to from above seven in 2017. The 9 or 5.19 per million ounce worked in a supporting period. We maintain the belief that the safe mine is a profitable mine. We have reduced our gearing and built a strong balance sheet, which is now in the net cash position of ZAR 74 million or US$ 4 million.\nThrough organic growth and investment, we continue to convert our mineral resources to quality mineral reserves, focusing on higher grades and margins. This is evident of our comprehensive pipeline of projects in execution. Group all-in sustaining cost improved to ZAR 843 and ZAR 43,000 a kilogram or US$1,403 per ounce. We achieved higher underground recovered grades at 6.29 grams per tonne. Harmony generated a record operating free cash flow of ZAR 7.1 billion or $381 million. This equates to a group operating free cash flow margin of 24%. Our acquisitions have transformed Harmony completely, having added quality ounces and copper to our asset portfolio. We are a new company with a long and exciting future ahead of us. The effective allocation of capital has created is in a position to return capital to our shareholders, rewarding them for investing in Harmony story.\nAllow me to unpack the operational performance for this reporting period. The stellar results in this reporting period were a result of our ongoing investment in operational excellence. This has enabled us to deliver consistency throughout the gold cycle. We are, therefore, well-positioned to take advantage of the current high gold price. Let me give six reasons why I strongly believe Harmony will continue to deliver. First, everything we do starts with safety, which I again want to emphasize is non-negotiable. This is supported by a healthy organizational culture. Operational flexibility and predictability in our planning ensures that we consistently deliver on the tonnes alongside higher-grade ounces. Harmony has always controlled what we can with cost being one key factor.\nWith the rand cost base, we have a stable and predictable cost structure. The strong partnerships that we have built with our stakeholders enable us to maintain a social license and continue operating successfully. Our substantial mineral resource based on other 174 million ounces, presents an abundance of opportunity to grow our mineral reserves through internal investments. Let's look at the numbers supporting these statements. We are seeing a continued improvement in safety performance. It requires a daily commitment, and we are confident that we will ultimately achieve this zero of \u2013 the goal of zero loss of life. Our proactive culture of safety and care has resulted in our lost time injury frequency rate trending lower. Group lost time injury frequency rates improved from 5.1 -- improved to $5.19 per million ounces worth in the first half of this financial year.\nOur operational results demonstrate that the safe mine is a productive mine. An incredible amount of work goes into ensuring that our workplaces are made safe. We have continued safety awareness initiatives to reinforce that safety always comes first. Regretly four of our colleagues have lost their lives in the mine-related incidents since the start of this financial year. Each loss of life is a sharp reminder that more needs to be done. We mourn the passing of these colleagues and we work tirelessly to ensure that each Harmonian [ph] returns home on safely. Improved planning allows for better flexibility and predictability. This combined with the acquisition of higher-quality assets resulted in a multiple improvement in recovered grades. Underground recovered grade in this reporting period increased by 11% to the 6.29 grams a tonne from the 5.6 grams per tonne year-on-year.\nThis now exceeds the upper end of our full year guidance. This has primarily been driven by the high-grade underground mines in Penang at North Tshepong. Consequently, production increased by 14% to 36 tonnes of gold or 832,000 ounces, and we expect to meet or exceed the upper end of our FY 2024 production guidance. These charts perfectly illustrate our effective capital allocation has transformed Harmony. We continue to see an improvement in our all-in sustaining costs in both rand and US dollar terms. Our rand all-in sustaining costs improved by 5% to 843,000 rand a kilogram. However, we delivered a remarkable 12% improvement in US dollar all-in sustaining costs to just over $1,400 per ounce. This considerable shift down in global all-in sustaining cost growth has been a function of the higher grades, well-managed cost increases and increased the production and prices of [indiscernible] at Hidden Valley Mine and Moab Khotsong operational, respectively.\nWith over 90% of our input source in South Africa, we have been largely protected from the rampant global information. In addition, our labor electricity cost increases are predictable, allowing us to manage our cost effectively and deliver this guidance. We're a proud South African gold producer and are fortunate to sell our gold in U.S. dollars. As a result, our all-in sustaining cost margins are now over ZAR 350,000 per kilogram or $600 an ounce. Improved safety and higher-grade grades translated into high production. This was further supported by a strong rand per kilogram gold price received. This allowed for higher margins, driving record operating free cash flows. Total operating free cash flows increased by 265% to ZAR 7.1 billion, while operating free cash flow margins expanded to 24% from the 9%.\nIn U.S. dollars, we generated $381 million in operating free cash flow, up 237% year-on-year. To put this in perspective, we generated more operating free cash flows in rand over the past six months than we have in the previously full year period. The majority of our total free fresh operating flow comes from our South African high-grade operations at Hidden Valley in Papua New Guinea. Our South African high-grade underground mines contributed 51% of the total production, but delivered 45% of operating free cash flows at a margin of 34%. Let me remind you that the South African optimized underground assets continue to serve the company well. This mine produced 40% of the total production and generated 90% of group operating free cash flows at a margin of 11%.\nBearing in mind that we are investing significant capital to expand our South African surface operations. These assets produced 17% of the group production, generating 11% of the operating free cash flow at a margin of 17%. Hidden Valley produced at 12% of the group production but contributed 25% to the total operating free cash flows and had a phenomenal 50% margin. Sustainability and ethical mining are integral to our operating model at Harmony. The sub-multiples stewardship is about managing all aspects of ESG. We support the circular economy through decarbonization, more specifically through energy efficiencies, renewable energy programs and green energy mix. Effective waste management through waste rock and planning street treatment. We also donate waste rock dumps to our communities for aggregate production.\nWe promote good water stewardships good for the prioritizing the recycling and efficient use of this scarce resource. And we contribute to the resilience and the prosperity of our host committees through benefit sharing. This makes Harmony a partner of choice. Mining with purpose is what we are all about. Through sustainability is embedded in all we are our decisions that we make. At Harmony, we believe in actions over words. As a result, we continue to receive positive external recognition for our efforts in sustainability. We have once again been included in the FTSE4Good Index. On inclusion in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index for five consecutive years demonstrate we foster gender diversity and inclusivity. We always treat our employees fairly without bias or prejudices of any kind.\nWe have received a score A from the CDP for best practice in water management strategy in 2023. And our near-term and longer-term carbon reduction targets have been validated by design-based target initiative as we aim for net carbon zero by 2045. Because Life of Mine is finite, we are continually investing in converting our resource to reserves, while striking a balance between capital intensity and shareholder returns. Harmony presents a substantial opportunity to invest in an exciting gold copper story. Our resource base, which includes copper is to big to ignore. We are in a fortunate position that we can deliver on our long-term plans for internal investment, as we convert these resources to reserves. Our production profile has been significantly derisked and future production will come from combination of South African surface and underground gold, Papua New Guinea copper and gold and Australian copper.\nOur quality growth pipeline is aimed at creating long-term value, as we take our projects up the value curve. Feasibility studies to determine the possibility of safely extending Mponeng and conducting the pillar extraction of the Tau Tona have been completed. I'm delighted to announce that we have received Board approval and will commence with the life of mine extension project at Mponeng in the West region. I will impact more on Mponeng in the next few slides. We are conducting various exploration drilling activities across all other jurisdictions. The Eva Copper feasibility studies are being updated and negotiations to permit Wafi-Golpu are also continuing. We are making good progress with various projects currently in execution. The Moab Khotsong extension, Mine Waste Solution, TSF Extension and Hidden Valley extension are all progressing well and further details are available in the next year.\nNow moving to Mponeng life of mine extension project. Mponeng was acquired in 2020, we began a comprehensive update of the feasibility study to determine if we could extend Mponeng life of mine. After the two-year study, we now have an optimized mine design, which ensures we can extend the life of Mponeng both safely and profitably. The project means all our investment criteria. Mponeng is in incredible mine with an existing world-class infrastructure. There's a mine with access to both -- to two excellent ore bodies, namely of carbon leader and the [indiscernible]. Both of these economic horizons have exceptional grades north of nine grams a tonne. This major project will convert over three million ounces into mineral reserves, delivering at an average steady-state production of 260,000 ounces per annum or 8 tonnes per annum of gold.\nOnce the project is complete, we are forecasting a cash contribution of about ZAR 2.5 billion per annum from this project at a real gold price of ZAR 1.1 million kilogram. Because of this high grade, the projects will have an attractive real all-in sustaining cost of ZAR 768,000 a kilogram or $1,290 per ounce based on current assumptions and estimations. The life of mine will be extended from the 7 to 20 years, ensuring Mponeng remains a top performing asset in our portfolio until at least 2044. Capital expenditure for these projects will be manageable and affordable. This project will be self-funded through internal cash flows. With a substantial mineral resource of 24 million ounces, that's another example of how we continue to extend our reduced production profile by converting mineral resources to mineral reserves.\nWe are proud that in our hands, Mponeng will reach its true potential and deliver a significant positive social impact. This embodies our Harmony creates long-term value for the shareholders and stakeholders. A derisked modular approach will be taken to access three high-grade blocks. State Health were at the forefront of our design methodology and mining practices. The project will focus on mining the two ore bodies landed the VCR and carbon leader. This will ensure that we maintain a high level of flexibility. The extension is only about 270 meters deeper. This will target early gold by accessing the Harmony go through a ramp system at 120 level and the VCR will be actually through the West and the eastern side. Lastly, we will also remind the VCR portion of the Tau Tona shafts pillars, which provides additional high-grade ounces.\nThis is truly for illustrative purposes and includes both approved plans and projects still in feasibility. Adding the Mponeng extension, Eva Copper and Wafi Golpu, Harmony going to remain at 1.5 million producer well into the future. Importantly, the Mponeng extension combined with Moab Khotsong extension will deliver over 400,000 ounces high-quality, low-cost ounces per annum for more than two decades. This will ensure strong future cash flows at higher margins. There is a significant potential within our asset base for further value to be unlocked through future mineral resource conversion. Bear in mind that this illustration also excludes any potential future value-accretive acquisitions that form part of our strategy. Capital guidance for FY 2024 remains unchanged.\nCapital for early work development from Mponeng was provided for in the FY 2024 capital budget. We estimate a ZAR7.9 billion in project capital over the life of the project in real terms. Capital guidance for FY 2025 onwards will now include the Mponeng extension project. Mponeng generated ZAR1.9 billion in operating free cash flow in the reporting period in this particular six months. At an annual estimated CapEx of ZAR1 billion or approximately US$50 million, this project is therefore affordable and at a low capital intensity. Harmony is sizeable and well-sequenced project pipeline. Our project timing is deliberate and ensures our project capital remains affordable and does not put pressure on our balance sheet. These projects are catalysts for meaningful, sustainable production and expand our margins within driving costs down in the future.\nNow allow me to hand over to my colleague and Financial Director, Boipelo Lekubo to run through the financials. Over to you, Boipelo.\nBoipelo Lekubo: Thank you, Peter. I'm pleased to present our exceptional financial performance for this reporting period. All US dollar figures and conversions are in their exchange. Group revenue for this financial half year increased by 35% to ZAR31 billion. EBITDA increased by 114% to ZAR17 billion. As a result, headline earnings per share increased by 226% to ZAR 956 per share. With ZAR 9.8 billion in available headroom through cash and undrawn facilities, our balance sheet is well positioned to execute on our project pipeline and acquisition ambitions. Through operational excellence and consistent production, we have healthy margins at current gold prices. At ZAR1.2 million per kilogram or $2,000 an ounce, our all-in cost margin is at 33%.\nThis is essentially the margin available after all major capital. Our all-in sustaining cost margin is 42% and our cash operating cost margin is 68%. We are therefore well positioned with good buffers to absorb any adverse movements in the gold price. We have an effective hedging program in place with 20% of our production hedged over 24 months. The Rand gold hedge book was maintained at 20% or 558,000 ounces at an average forward hedge cover of over ZAR1.256 million a kilogram. Returning cash to shareholders alongside our growth aspirations remains a key priority. Harmony's dividend policy is to pay a return of 20%, net free cash generated to shareholders, at the discretion of the directors -- of the Board of Directors. The strong operational performance and exceptional net free cash generation, resulted in a record interim dividend of ZAR1.47 or US$ 0.80 per share declared, which will result in a record payment to shareholders of over ZAR1 billion.\nThis has resulted in a 12-month dividend yield of just over 2%. Cumulatively, we've paid ZAR2.7 billion in dividends, since 2016.

Is now a good time to invest in gold? What are the top exchange-traded funds that offer exposure to the price of gold?\nWhy Would Burry Invest in Gold in 2024?\nBurry\u2019s Scion filing with the SEC offers no explanation for buying a physical gold fund in the first quarter, here are potential reasons for buying the precious metal in 2024:\nInflation Hedge\nInflation has been a major concern in 2024, with rising prices eroding the purchasing power of currencies. Gold is often seen as a hedge against inflation, as its price has historically tended to rise over time. Investors might turn to gold to protect their portfolios from inflation's effects.\nSafe-Haven Demand\nEconomic uncertainty and ongoing geopolitical tensions around the world, including the ongoing Ukraine war and Israel/Palestine war, can create a flight to safety among investors. Gold, a perceived safe-haven asset, often benefits from such uncertainty as investors seek to preserve their wealth.\nImpact on Currency Exchange\nGold is often denominated in U.S. dollars (USD). When interest rates fall in the US, the USD might become less attractive to foreign investors seeking higher returns elsewhere. A weakening USD can make gold, priced in USD, relatively cheaper for foreign investors, potentially increasing demand and pushing up the price.\nCentral Banks Buying Gold\nCentral banks around the world, particularly those in China, have been major buyers of gold in recent years. This strong and consistent demand from central banks can help support and potentially push up the price of gold.\nReduced Opportunity Cost\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to begin cutting interest rates in 2024. When interest rates fall, the returns offered by bonds and other fixed-income investments become less appealing. This makes gold, which doesn't offer regular income, relatively more attractive to some investors.",

Let\u2019s take a look at the stock\u2019s fundamentals.\nKey Projects to Drive Production Upside for Barrick\nBarrick is well-placed to benefit from the progress in key growth projects that should significantly contribute to its production. Its major gold and copper growth projects, including Goldrush, the Pueblo Viejo plant expansion and mine life extension, Donlin Gold, Fourmile, Lumwana Super Pit and Reko Diq, are currently being executed.\nThese projects are advancing on schedule and within budget, underpinning the next generation of profitable production. The restart of the Porgera mine would offer a further upside, supporting the company\u2019s planned production ramp-up through 2024.\nThe recently commissioned Goldrush mine is ramping up to a targeted 400,000 ounces of production per annum by 2028. Bordering Goldrush is the 100% Barrick-owned Fourmile, which is yielding grades double those of Goldrush and is anticipated to become another Tier One mine. The Reko Diq copper-gold project in Pakistan is designed to produce 400,000 tons of copper and 500,000 ounces of gold annually in its second development phase.\nLast month, Barrick announced the official commencement of the development of a Super Pit at its Lumwana copper mine in Zambia. The Super Pit Expansion feasibility study is anticipated to be completed by the end of the year, with construction beginning in 2025. The expansion entails doubling the present process circuit's throughput and substantially boosting mining volumes. Upon completion, the $2 billion project has the potential to transform Lumwana into a long-term, high-yielding, top-25 copper producer and Tier One copper mine.\nRallying Gold Prices to Drive GOLD\u2019s Margins and Cash Flow\nRallying gold prices should translate into strong profit margins and free cash flow generation. Gold prices are hitting record highs this year, and the yellow metal has been among the best-performing assets. Gold has rallied roughly 33% this year, driven by strong demand from central banks, a dovish Fed interest rate outlook, global uncertainties and a surge in safe-haven demand thanks to geopolitical tensions. The recent rally in gold prices has been supported by the 50-basis-point cut in interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve, growing expectations of another rate reduction in November, uncertainties over the U.S. presidential election, and increased tensions in the Middle East, which fueled safe-haven demand.\nGOLD\u2019s Strong Liquidity & Attractive Dividend Bode Well\nBarrick has a robust liquidity position and generates healthy cash flows, which position it well to take advantage of attractive development, exploration and acquisition opportunities, as well as drive shareholder value and reduce debt. At the end of the second quarter of 2024, Barrick\u2019s cash and cash equivalents were around $4 billion. It also generated an operating cash flow of $1.16 billion and a free cash flow of $340 million.\nGOLD offers a healthy dividend yield of 2.1% at the current stock price. Its payout ratio is 39% (a ratio below 60% is a good indicator that the dividend will be sustainable), with a five-year annualized dividend growth rate of 11.5%.\nValuation Looks Attractive for GOLD Stock\nGOLD\u2019s attractive valuation should lure investors seeking value. The stock is currently trading at a forward 12-month earnings multiple of 10.45X, lower than its five-year median. This represents a roughly 23% discount when stacked up with the industry average of 13.57X.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nGOLD\u2019s Rising Earnings Estimates Instil Optimism\nEarnings estimates for Barrick have been going up over the past 60 days, reflecting analysts\u2019 optimism. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 and 2025 have been revised upward over the same time frame.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for 2024 is currently pegged at $1.29, suggesting year-over-year growth of 53.6%. Earnings are also expected to register 47.2% growth in 2025.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nGOLD Stock Underperforms Industry and S&P 500\nBarrick\u2019s price performance has been lackluster this year despite the rally in gold prices. GOLD\u2019s shares have gained 4.3% year to date, underperforming the Zacks Mining \u2013 Gold industry\u2019s 29.8% increase and the S&P 500\u2019s rise of 20.1%. Its peers, Newmont Corporation NEM, Kinross Gold Corporation KGC and Agnico Eagle Mines Limited AEM, have racked up gains of 11.1%, 68.6% and 56.4%, respectively, over the same period.\nGOLD\u2019s YTD Price Performance\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nHow Should Investors Play the GOLD Stock?\nGOLD presents a compelling investment case with a strong pipeline of growth projects, solid financials, rallying gold prices and a healthy growth trajectory. Its cheap valuation also offers an attractive entry point.

In this article, we will look at where Agnico Eagle Mines (NYSE:AEM) ranks among the best TSX stocks to invest in now.\nCanada\u2019s Economy Shows Signs of Stabilization\nAccording to Deloitte, the Canadian economy is showing signs of stabilisation after three years of turmoil, with inflation steadily declining since June 2022. Canada\u2019s economy grew stronger in the first half of 2024 than previously forecast, but the pace of recovery is expected to be limited in the second half of the year due to slower household spending. The updated forecast projects real GDP growth of 1.2% for 2024, followed by 2.6% growth in 2025, with real GDP per person falling by 1.6% in 2024 before clawing back to gain 1.1% growth in 2025.\nThe Bank of Canada has begun to ease its monetary policy, paving the way for stronger economic growth. However, the pace of monetary easing is uncertain, and weak investment and productivity performance continue to pose a risk to Canada\u2019s long-term economic outlook. The Bank of Canada is expected to cut interest rates at a gradual pace, with a rate cut in September followed by another in December and March. The overnight rate is expected to settle at a neutral level of 2.75% by the end of next year, assuming inflation continues to decrease and returns to the 2% target by the second quarter of next year.\nBusiness sentiment in Canada is beginning to recover, with improved confidence across regions and sectors. However, business investment has been weak, directly impacting productivity and living standards. Since the 2014 commodity price crash, labour productivity in Canada has remained flat, while unit labour costs have increased by over 30%.\nThe economy\u2019s current challenge is generating enough jobs to keep up with Canada\u2019s rapidly growing population. Despite a strong pace of growth, employment has not kept up with population growth over the past 12 months, resulting in a rise in the unemployment rate. Wage growth slowed dramatically in the first quarter of 2024, and slower wage growth is expected to be the norm this year and next.\nCanadian households are the most indebted in the G7, and the increases in interest rates since 2022 have hit their pocketbooks. Real consumer spending per person has fallen in five of the last six quarters, and the effect on home-building has been even more dramatic. However, consumer spending and residential investment are expected to increase as interest rate decreases work to restore demand.\nEconomist Predicts Stronger Economic Growth for Canada\nJames Orlando, a senior economist at TD Bank, is optimistic about Canada\u2019s economic growth prospects, particularly in light of the recent interest rate cuts by the Bank of Canada. According to Orlando, Canada\u2019s economic growth has consistently lagged behind the United States, but a change in interest rate policy could help close the gap. The Bank of Canada\u2019s decision to cut interest rates is expected to lead to lower mortgage rates and increased consumer spending. This, in turn, could boost economic growth and help Canada catch up with the United States.\nOrlando notes that the Canadian economy is highly sensitive to interest rates, particularly in the housing market. With high levels of debt and a reliance on variable-rate mortgages, Canadians are more likely to feel the pinch of higher interest rates. However, with the Bank of Canada\u2019s rate cuts, Orlando expects to see increased investment in the housing market and potentially improved affordability. While affordability is still a concern, Orlando believes that the rate cuts will help to stimulate economic growth and create jobs.\nOrlando also notes that the Canadian economy is expected to benefit from increased investment in areas such as the green transition and the production of electric vehicles. With a growing population and a need for more housing, Orlando expects to see increased investment in the housing market and other areas of the economy. While there are still challenges ahead, Orlando believes that the Bank of Canada\u2019s rate cuts and the resulting economic stimulus will help to drive growth and create jobs in the Canadian economy.\nWhile Canada\u2019s economy is showing signs of stabilisation, the economy still faces significant challenges, including weak investment and productivity performance, a rapidly growing population, and high household debt levels. However, with the Bank of Canada easing its monetary policy and interest rates expected to decrease, consumer spending and residential investment are expected to increase, paving the way for stronger economic growth in the long term. With that in context, let\u2019s take a look at the 8 best TSX stocks to invest in now.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we used Finviz and Yahoo Finance stock screeners plus online rankings to compile an initial list of the 40 largest companies in Canada by market cap. From that list, we narrowed our choice down to the 8 stocks that were the most widely held by hedge funds, as of Q2 of 2024. The list is sorted in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors in each stock.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nAgnico Eagle Mines (NYSE:AEM) is the largest gold miner in Canada and the third-largest globally, with a portfolio of 11 mines spanning across Canada, Australia, Finland, and Mexico. Agnico Eagle Mines (NYSE:AEM) boasts a proven track record of expanding production and reserves, with a pipeline of near to mid-term opportunities to drive further growth.\nIn Q2 2024, Agnico Eagle Mines\u2019 (NYSE:AEM) gold production reached 0.9 million ounces, bringing the total for the first half of 2024 to 1.77 million ounces. This puts the company on track to meet the upper end of its production guidance for the year. With strong production and rising gold prices, Agnico Eagle Mines (NYSE:AEM) revenue has increased by 20.9% year-over-year in Q2, and by 21% year-over-year for the first half of 2024.\nThe company\u2019s margins have also remained strong, with an adjusted net margin of 23.4% in H1, up from 16.5% in 2023. These numbers have led to an upgrade in projections, with revenue expected to increase by 19.5% in 2024, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) expected to reach $3.45, a 10% increase from previous forecasts. Alluvium Asset Management said the following regarding Agnico Eagle Mines (NYSE:AEM) in their second-quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cOur gold miners had quite divergent performance, Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM) was up 11.4%, but Regis Resources was down 12.9%. They both provided quarterly updates. Regis reported business disruptions due to poor weather, but management maintained its output and cost guidance. It also announced the approval of two underground projects that will add around 25% to production levels from 2027, but they will cost circa AUD 150m. Agnico reported more positive results and reiterated guidance. We have revised our long-term gold price and exchange rate assumptions (which remain conservative). On our earnings based models we still view Regis as cheap and Agnico as expensive. But that ignores management, and, to a large extent, growth prospects. And when we consider those factors the equation looks decidedly more balanced. So despite Regis trading at an even larger discount to our valuation we have not bought more, and despite Agnico trading at an even larger premium to our valuation, we have not recently sold any. The Fund\u2019s combined position in these gold miners is 6.6%.\u201d\nGold prices reached an all-time high of $2,670 per ounce on September 25. According to J.P. Morgan Research, gold prices are expected to remain stable at $2,500 per ounce by the end of 2024 and rise to $2,600 per ounce in the first half of 2025. Agnico Eagle Mines (NYSE:AEM) is well-positioned to capitalise on this upward trend in gold prices. In the second quarter, Agnico Eagle Mines\u2019 (NYSE:AEM) stock was held by 50 hedge funds with stakes worth $767.39 million.\nOverall AEM ranks 4th on our list of the best TSX stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of AEM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AEM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.",

(NYSE:FNV) is that it expanded its portfolio to include energy (oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids in the United States).\nI have been an Franco-Nevada shareholder for many years, and I consider the company one of the safest around, even after the recent Cobre Panama setback\nHowever, this unfortunate experience in Panama has demonstrated the company is not completely immune to the risks associated with mining. In fact, there is a strong link between the company and the miners associated with it that cannot be overlooked.\nThe company's asset diversification is the ultimate protection. However, Franco-Nevada must control the capital expenditure attributed to one single project and avoid overspending on assets, presenting contentious issues in a risky jurisdiction.\nUnfortunately, Cobre Panama was a costly mistake, and the company is paying dearly, as are its shareholders, who saw the stock plummet in a matter of weeks.\nThird-quarter results summary\nThe Toronto-based miner released third-quarter results on Nov. 8 that exceeded analysts' expectations. It posted adjusted earnings of 91 cents per share, or net income of $175.1 million. Franco-Nevada also declared a quarterly dividend of 34 cents per share.\nRevenue was$309.5 million for the quarter, up 1.7% from the prior-year period but down 6.2% sequentially.\nThe company's royalties and streams focus primarily on gold, representing approximately 64.5% of the total revenue, as shown in the chart for the quarter.\nAlso, this quarter, the production of gold equivalent ounces attributed to gold was 103,641 GEOs. The company said in the press release:\n\"Precious metal revenue accounted for 77.8% of our revenue (64.5% gold, 10.2% silver, and 3.1% PGM). U.S. revenue was sourced at 88.0% from the Americas (28.7% from South America, 28.4% from Central America and Mexico, 15.9% from the U.S., and 15.0% from Canada).\"\nFranco Nevada presents an excellent debt profile, with a new record in total cash of $1.29 billion and no debt. Liquidity is now $2.3 billion.\nFinally, the company's cash flow from operations was $236 million, while capital expenditures were $165.4 million, resulting in a $70.6 million positive free cash flow, down from $229.2 million a year ago.\nThe recent closure of Panama's Cobre Panama Copper Mine is a major setback\nOn Nov. 29, we learned the Supreme Court of Panama ruled that Law 406, approved on Oct. 20, authorizing the mining concession for 20 years between Panama and Sociedad Minera Panama, was unconstitutional. As a result, the mine was forced to close. It was a huge setback and had a huge economic impact for the country as well. A press release noted:\n\"According to government figures, its proceeds accounted for 3.5% of Panama's GDP in 2021. The mine also employed 8,000 people directly and created indirect employment for tens of thousands more.\"\nCobre Panama generated $223 million in revenue for Franco-Nevada in 2022, making it one of its four primary assets. The two-open-pit mine produced 112,734 metric tons of copper in the third quarter, accounting for about 40% of First Quantum's (TSX:FM), a partner of Franco-Nevada's, revenue in 2022.\nThe chart below shows how quickly First Quantum and Franco Nevada dropped due to the news. The first blow came when protests and blockades disrupted ore delivery, and the second came when the Supreme Court ruled the concession was unconstitutional.\nThe copper mine is expected to last more than 30 years, with the streamer investing $1.36 billion in its construction, as shown in the company's recent presentation:\nFollowing the closure of the Cobre Panama copper mine, Franco-Nevada was forced to lower its 2023 guidance.\nGold equivalent production in the third quarter of 2023\nThe total gold equivalent production was 160,848 GEOs in the third quarter, up 8.8% year over year and down 4.5% sequentially.This amount includes the energy segment, which has been converted into GEOs. However, production from gold, silver and platinum group metals was 125,337 ounces.\nThe company has benefited this quarter from rising gold prices and increased GEOs from its precious metal assets. However, the energy sector was weaker year on year due to lower gas and oil prices than the previous year's highs.\nNewly adjusted 2023 guidance\nOn Nov. 20, Franco-Nevada adjusted its 2023 guidance to reflect the cessation of Cobre Panama operations. The number of precious metal GEOs dropped to 480,000 to 500,000 (excluding energy and others) from a previous range of 490,000 to 530,000, and the total production dropped to 620,000 to 640,000 GEOs from 640,000 to 700,000 GEOs previously.\nTechnical analysis\nNote: The chart is adjusted for the dividend.\nFranco-Nevada forms a descending channel pattern with resistance at $112.5 and support at $106.25. At 31, the relative strength index is blinking a buy signal.\nThe falling or descending channel patterns are bearish in the short term, but often form within longer-term uptrends as the pattern continues. A breakout often follows the descending channel pattern.\nOne possible strategy is to hold a medium to long-term position in Franco-Nevada and trade last in, first out with 40% to 55% of your holdings while you wait for a higher final price target.\nSelling gradually between $111 and $115, with higher resistance at $122.5, seems reasonable. If support cannot hold, adding between $108.50 and $105.50 with lower support, which might be found at $103, would be advantageous.\nWarning: For the TA chart to remain current, it must be updated often. The above chart may be valid for up to one or two weeks. Keep in mind that the TA chart is simply a tool to assist you in choosing the best course of action. The future is promised to no man.",

His companies, Tesla and SpaceX, have received billions of dollars in federal contracts, including electric vehicle tax credits and government infrastructure support. Critics argue that this could present a conflict of interest if Musk leads a commission tasked with reducing government spending.\nBrian Riedl, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, told the Washington Post, \"The idea that one can cut $2 trillion in wasteful and unnecessary programs is absolutely absurd. There's a long history of the fantasy that one smart businessman will just identify trillions in waste, but that's just not how it works.\"\nSee Also: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Or\u00e9al, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years \u2013 here's how there's an opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share today.\nFederal spending in fiscal year 2024 reach $6.75 trillion, according to the U.S. Treasury. Musk's proposed $2 trillion cut is almost one-third of this spending, but many are concerned that in order to achieve a severe slash in budget like this, much-need government services will be impacted.",

        "full_text": "Personal finance: Understand the nuances of investing in gold\nGold has been a symbol of wealth and stability for centuries, and it continues to be a go-to investment for those seeking stability in uncertain economic times. But investors need to understand the nuances involved in owning gold \u2013 such as knowing the real benefits, how physical gold compares to gold stocks, and the truth about its effectiveness against inflation. It's also important for anyone considering gold to think about the timing of their investment and how it complements their broader financial portfolio.\nHere's a little historical context\nIn 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Gold Reserve Act into law. This legislation centralized all monetary gold ownership with the U.S. Treasury and ended the practice of redeeming U.S. dollars for gold in domestic transactions. Its goal was to stabilize the economy during the Great Depression by giving the government more control over the monetary supply. Critics, however, argued it limited personal and institutional gold ownership \u2013 fundamentally altering the U.S. monetary system in the process.\nThis prohibition on private gold ownership was lifted when President Ford signed a bill repealing the relevant sections of the Gold Reserve Act. This legislation, which took effect on December 31, 1974, allowed U.S. citizens to own gold bullion without any restrictions. (Before this repeal, Americans could own gold coins, but restrictions were in place for gold bullion.)\nWhy investors turn to gold in uncertain times\nGold is often seen as a reliable investment when the economy or the stock market is not doing well. This perception of gold as a safe haven is rooted in its historical stability, which investors find attractive when the future looks unpredictable. Recent global events, like ongoing elections, continuing conflicts in regions like Ukraine and Israel/Palestine, and economic upheavals, have created a sense of uncertainty that's driving some investors to take a closer look at gold.\nBut deciding when to invest in gold and when to sell can be tricky. While gold can be a safe choice when other investments are falling, it usually grows less than stocks and bonds over the long term. The challenge for investors is figuring out when to move their money out of gold and into these other investments. This decision is difficult because it's hard to predict how long the uncertainty will last or when the stock market will start to recover. Investors need to weigh the comparative safety of gold against the potential for higher returns from other investments.\nPhysical gold vs. gold stocks\nMany people don\u2019t realize there\u2019s a significant difference between owning physical gold and investing in gold stocks. Physical gold means having actual gold items, such as bars and coins. While these represent a tangible investment that some investors find attractive, they also come with the need for secure storage and finding a trustworthy seller. On the other hand, gold stocks represent investments in companies that mine or trade gold. They don't involve owning gold in its physical form.",

The current owners, who purchased the home from Musk with a loan, have fallen behind on payments, leading to foreclosure proceedings.\nThe property will be auctioned unless a buyer is found before next month.\nMusk purchased the 2,756-square-foot residence for $6.75 million in 2013. In 2020, he announced on Twitter (now X) his intention to sell \"almost all physical possessions\" and \"own no house.\" He stipulated that this Bel-Air home should not be demolished or altered in a way that would diminish its character.\nSee Also: Over the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83% \u2014 Investors like Bill O\u2019Reilly and Rudy Giuliani are using this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence.\nFollowing through on his pledge, Musk later sold the house to filmmaker Jordan Walker-Pearlman (Wilder's nephew) and his wife, Elizabeth Hunter, for $7 million.\nMusk loaned the couple $6.7 million through a limited liability company (LLC) to facilitate the purchase, but Walker-Pearlman has since fallen behind on payments. In July, a notice of default was issued, followed by a notice of trustee's sale earlier this month. The home is scheduled for public auction on Dec. 3, where it will be sold to the highest bidder.\nWalker-Pearlman and Hunter are cooperating with Musk and told The Wall Street Journal they are \"at peace\" with the foreclosure process.\nTrending: Arrived Home's Private Credit Fund\u2019s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with just a $100 minimum.\nLike Musk's 2020 tweet, the current listing stipulates that the property cannot be demolished.

(NYSE:MUX) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript March 1, 2024\nMcEwen Mining Inc. isn't one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\nOperator: Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to McEwen Mining's Q4 and Year-End 2023 Operating and Financial Results Conference Call. Present from the company today are Rob McEwen, Chairman and Chief Owner; Perry Ing, Chief Financial Officer; William Shaver, Chief Operating Officer; Stefan Spears, Vice President, Corporate Development; Michael Meding, Vice President and General Manager of McEwen Copper; Jeff Chan, Vice President, Finance; Carmen Diges, General Counsel and Secretary. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Rob McEwen, Chief Owner. Please go ahead, sir.\nRob McEwen : Thank you, operator. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome. I'm delighted to say we had a great year. Not only did our strategy to surface value of McEwen Copper and a very large copper project, Los Azules, delivered large gains, but also our gold and silver mines increased production and met guidance and reduce their production cost per ounce closer to industry averages. In addition, our exploration efforts delivered solid gains in -- at Los Azules and that's our properties in Timmins. And all of this allowed us to report a net income of $54.7 million or $1.15 per share, versus a net loss of $81.1 million or $1.71 in 2022. These big swings in our bottom line are largely due to our investment in McEwan Copper and its 100% ownership in our massive Los Azules property.\nPrior to last October, we own more than 50% of McEwen Copper. And as a result, McEwen Mining's financials represented the consolidation of its financials with that of McEwen Copper, where we have been spending hundreds of millions of dollars, advancing the Los Azules project first to an updated preliminary economic assessment, which we released in June of last year. And now we're driving towards completing a bankable feasibility study in the first quarter of 2025. In October of last year, we completed our third financing of McEwen Copper. And as a result of that, our ownership dropped below 50% to 48% and that led to us no longer consolidating the financials of McEwen Copper, and it generated a significant gain, which is reflected in our financials, which was the strategy from the very beginning to surface value for McEwen Mining.\nNow the biggest -- I think we're trading at a substantial discount. And I can see a price that --although we're trading around $6 a share, and it is biased. We have a management view that we're trading at anywhere between $7 and $29 a share. So I think there's a lot of room on the upside. And that's driven by -- we have basically three sets of assets and that's the sum of the parts. We have McEwen Copper, which we own 48% of, we have a royalty portfolio. And we have our gold and silver assets. So we have values ranging from $8 to $30 a share. So I think there's -- you can look at it and say we're trading at a big discount for where there's a lot of upside. Now it's been a hard couple of years for us and shareholders. From September '18 to the end of August '22, our share price was going in one direction, and that was not the direction I ever wanted it to go.\nAnd that was down. And I call that the road to hell. Right now, I'll call it, we're on the road to redemption. And if we compare our results, and maybe it's a false cheer. But when you look at how we performed against the price of gold, the price of copper, the NASDAQ, the Dow since September '22, when we did our first financing in McEwen Copper. McEwen Mining is up 107%, the NASDAQ is up 37%, Silver 27%, the Dow 23%, Gold 20%, GDX 14%, GDXJ up 13% and Copper up 12%. We're clearly outperforming. I think we have two drivers. One is our copper, which I think is -- and have long considered a potential copper unicorn and that we're seen shape out. And then the second is the turnaround in our gold and silver assets that are delivering positive cash flows and financing our exploration programs there.\nAnd we have some exciting development programs one in Timmins, where we expect to put a ramp down and start production in '25 on a discovery we made several years ago. Stock West, Stock East. We recently put out some results, some intriguing high grade over there. And the importance of the stock mine, is threefold. One, it's right beside our mill. So it would eliminate the transportation costs we currently have of about $10 a ton. Two, it doesn't have a royalty on it. So we're going to save on that royalty of about $1,500 an ounce that we have to give up. And three, the rock is softer, which means we should be able to process a higher volume of material through the mill and in theory, produce more gold as a result of that and bring down our costs.\nAt Los Azules, in McEwen Copper, we delivered a very robust preliminary economic assessment in June. We've got a project there that I can't help myself, but I always look at something that's not gold and try to convert it into gold to try to get a sense of its scale. So when I do that with Los Azules, it's indicated and inferred resources, you get a resource of 37.6 billion pounds of copper. If you were to take today's price of gold and divided by the price of copper to find out how many copper pounds equals 1 ounce of gold is about 536 pounds of copper, 1 ounce of gold, divide that into 36.7 billion pounds of copper, and you're looking at a of gold equivalent deposit of 70 million ounces. The average production of 321 million pounds of copper per annum would translate into about 600,000 ounces a year.\nAnd with a cash cost of $1.07 a pound, the gold equivalent of that would be just under $600 an ounce. By my book, that is a big gold equivalent deposit and reflects the size and I think the power of Los Azules. This is -- we're looking at a 27-year life and I think there's still quite a bit of room in improving the value of that asset and that improving the value of McEwen Mining. And then you look at the gold and silver assets where we're doing exploration I'm quite pleased with what we're getting there. It's taken a while, but we're moving in very much the right direction. Our press release outlines pretty well. We have another project in Mexico that we're looking at advancing later this year. And I want to come back to Los Azules for a moment because what we're trying to do there is a bit different than what's in the market right now.\nMining generally is held in poor opinion by most of the world. I feel it's very damaging to the environment, and it's not important to life. But I can assure you, if all the mines stopped tomorrow, modern civilization would grind to an abrupt halt. And somehow, we have to put that message out there that we can mine the earth resources in a manner that is viewed as responsible and sensitive to the environment. So at Los Azules, Several years ago, we engaged the services of an architect who is very prominent in the green living building space. And asked him to help us redefine mining to look at it so that we could hopefully move in the direction of shifting the perception of the public perception of mining. And so we're looking to create the future.\nAnd in order to create the future, it has to look like the future, both in terms of its buildings. We have some wonderful renderings, very comfortable, safe, attractive accommodations for the workforce, but also looking at how do we treat the world. And we're looking at a project that will have a much lighter impact on the environment, initially emitting one third of CO2 emissions, using less than one quarter of the water of a comparable size, conventional copper mine being powered by 100% renewable energy sourced from hydro water and wind and producing a sustainable copper cathode. Most of the mines, copper mines today in the world produce concentrate that has to be shipped to a smelter, then convert it into a product that is usable by industry.\nWith our copper cathode, it can go directly to industry and cut out the transportation cost. And we think that will attract a premium in the marketplace as well. So with that, I'd like to open it up for questions.",

        "full_text": "Putting your money to work on Wall Street requires patience and perspective. Since this decade began, all three major stock indexes have vacillated between bear and bull markets in successive years, with these swings most pronounced in the growth stock-powered Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC).\nDuring the 2022 bear market, the Nasdaq Composite brought up the caboose with a 33% loss. But since closing this chapter, the Nasdaq has gained 51% and, as recently as last month, pushed to a new record-closing high above 16,400. This move confirms that the Nasdaq is firmly in a new, albeit young, bull market.\nWhat's particularly interesting about this leading index is that it's retraced nearly 4% off its all-time high, as of the closing bell on May 2. For long-term-minded investors with cash at the ready, it means growth stocks can still be found at a bargain.\nWhat follows are four colossal growth stocks you'll regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market.\nMastercard\nThe first sensational growth stock that's begging to be bought in the early stages of the new Nasdaq bull market is payment-processing leader Mastercard(NYSE: MA).\nThe only real knock against Mastercard is that it's a cyclical company. If the U.S. and global economy were to dip into a recession, consumer and enterprise spending would be expected to decline, which would have a negative effect on the fees Mastercard collects from merchants to process transactions. A couple of predictive indicators, including a historic decline in M2 money supply, suggest a growing likelihood of weakness to come in the U.S. economy.\nOn the other hand, history is very much on Mastercard's side. Whereas most periods of economic expansion last for years, there hasn't been a single U.S. recession since the end of World War II that endured longer than 18 months. Extended periods of growth allow Mastercard to consistently grow its sales by double digits year after year.\nThough it's a bit of a subtle point, Mastercard's purposeful avoidance of lending is another reason for its ongoing success and sustained profit margin of more than 40%. Companies that lend have to set aside capital to cover possible credit delinquencies and loan losses that arise during recessions. Strictly focusing on payment processing means Mastercard avoids these pitfalls and bounces back from downturns faster than most lending institutions.\nAdditionally, Mastercard's growth runway stretches for decades. Cross-border volume growth of 18% in the March-ended quarter speaks to just how large the opportunity is for it to continue expanding its payment infrastructure into underbanked regions, such as Africa, the Middle East, and Southeastern Asia.\nWhile Mastercard might look a bit pricey at nearly 27 times forward-year earnings, this represents a 21% discount to its average trailing-five-year forward-earnings multiple.\nNewmont\nA second colossal growth stock that you'll be kicking yourself for not buying in the early stages of the new Nasdaq bull market is gold-mining company Newmont(NYSE: NEM). Yes, you read that right... a gold stock that's also a growth stock.\nBefore (pardon the necessary pun) digging into company specifics, it's important to recognize the elephant in the room: The spot price of gold has surged to an all-time high in 2024.\nThe sizable rally in physical gold can be explained by a stubbornly high prevailing rate of inflation. In other words, people are looking for a place to park their cash (rather than letting it sit under the proverbial mattress) where it won't lose value over time. For decades, gold has been an asset that skittish investors have flocked to during periods of high inflation and/or economic turbulence. If the spot price of gold remains near an all-time high, it should translate into higher profitability for gold miners across the board.\nOne of the clearest company-specific catalysts for Newmont is its $16.8 billion, all-share buyout of Australia's Newcrest Mining, which closed in November. Newmont anticipates recognizing $500 million in cost synergies by the end of this year, as well as beefing up the combined company's operating cash flow by $2 billion within two years of closing. Buying Newcrest further solidified Newmont's already impressive gold and copper reserve profile.\nTo add to the above, Newmont's size presents clear cost advantages. Newmont has 10 \"Tier 1 assets,\" which are mines producing at least 500,000 gold equivalent ounces per year, with an all-in sustaining cost in the lower half of the industry, and a mine life of greater than 10 years.\nNewmont's earnings per share (EPS) is forecast to double between 2023 and 2027 to around $3.20, which makes this lustrous stock all the more delectable for growth seekers.\nBaidu\nThe third exhilarating growth stock you'll regret not adding to your portfolio with the Nasdaq firmly in a new bull market is China-based Baidu(NASDAQ: BIDU).\nThe reason Baidu's stock has struggled recently is because the Chinese economy hasn't bounced back from the COVID-19 pandemic as quickly as expected. Multiple years of stringent lockdowns created supply chain kinks that are still working themselves out.\nBut as I pointed out earlier, patience and perspective are important when investing on Wall Street. Although China's economic ramp-up is taking a bit longer than anticipated, its burgeoning middle class gives the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product a path to sustained annual growth of 5% (or higher). Most large China-based companies, including Baidu, are going to benefit from this extensive growth runway.\nBaidu's foundational operating segment is its internet search engine. Baidu's internet search share in China clocked in at close to 52% in April 2024, and has consistently come in at between 50% and 85% dating back 10 years, based on data from GlobalStats. Businesses are well aware that the best way to reach Chinese consumers is to target their advertising on Baidu's search engine. When China's economy finds its stride, once again, Baidu's ad revenue should increase substantially.\nHowever, Baidu's most exciting growth catalyst is artificial intelligence (AI). Enterprise cloud spending is still in its infancy in China, which bodes well for Baidu's AI Cloud platform. Meanwhile, subsidiary Apollo Go surpassed more than 5 million cumulative autonomous rides since its inception. Perhaps it's no surprise that Baidu is providing electric vehicle maker Tesla with its mapping license for data collection on Chinese roads.\nBaidu is forecast to grow its EPS by roughly 12% through 2027, but is currently valued at less than 10 times forward-year EPS. That's what we call a growth stock bargain!\nNextEra Energy\nA fourth colossal growth stock you'll regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market is the U.S.'s largest electric utility by market cap, NextEra Energy(NYSE: NEE).\nGenerally, utility stocks are slow-growing businesses that investors seek out for their low volatility and market-topping income. NextEra has been consistently doubling or tripling the growth rate of other electric utilities for more than a decade, which qualifies it as a growth stock in an industry where very few exist.\nThe not-so-subtle secret to NextEra's long-term outperformance has been its focus on renewable energy. Out of its 72 gigawatts (GW) of capacity, 36 GW can be traced to green energy sources, including 24 GW of wind and 7 GW of solar. No utility in the world has more wind or solar capacity than NextEra Energy.\nThough investing in cleaner energy solutions has been pricey, it's paid off in a big way for NextEra. Adjusted earnings have averaged a 10% growth rate since 2013, with dividend growth coming in at a compound annual rate of 11% over the same span. Substantially lower electricity generation costs have bolstered the company's profit and payout growth rates, compared to its peers.\nWhat's more, NextEra Energy has no intentions of paring back its clean energy investments. Even with the Federal Reserve undertaking its steepest rate-hiking cycle in four decades, NextEra plans to bring between 32.7 GW and 41.8 GW in collective clean energy projects online between the start of 2023 and end of 2026. This should help it sustain a superior growth rate within the utility sector.\nShares of NextEra Energy can be snatched up right now by opportunistic growth seekers for less than 19 times consensus EPS forecasts for 2025. That's a 27% discount to its average forward-year earnings multiple over the last five years.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Mastercard right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Mastercard, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Mastercard wasn\u2019t one of them.

The company conducts underground and surface gold mining. It is also engaged in related activities such as exploration, processing, smelting and refining. Harmony is South Africa's biggest gold producer by volume with production of 1.47 million ounces in fiscal 2023.\nThe company\u2019s mining operations are principally concentrated in South Africa. The company has nine underground operations located in the Witwatersrand Basin. Additionally, Harmony has an open-pit mine on the Kraaipan Greenstone Belt along with several surface sources treatment operations. The Hidden Valley, which is located in Papua New Guinea, is an open-pit silver and gold mine.\nAlso, many of these mines are located in the Free State Province such as Welcom, Virginia, Tshepong and Bambanani, along with the Evander gold mine in Mpumalanga province, the Elandskraal mine at the West Rand goldfields in Gauteng province, and Kalgold operations in the North West province.\nThe company has discontinued its mining operations at Mt. Magnet and South Kalgoorlie in Western Australia as a strategic move. Harmony recorded sales of $2,774 million for fiscal 2023 (ended Jun 30, 2023).\nExploration Projects\nDomestic Projects: In South Africa, Harmony operates a total of nine underground operations, one open pit operation and several surface operations including an open cast mine, and nine processing plants, which are located in all of the currently known goldfields in the Witwatersrand basin of South Africa as well as the Kraaipan Greenstone Belt.\nInternational Projects: In Papua New Guinea (PNG), Harmony has full ownership of Hidden Valley, an open-cast gold and silver project that began production in June 2009, and 50% ownership of the Wafi-Golpu project. Harmony\u2019s exploration portfolio focuses principally on highly prospective areas in PNG and the Wafi-Golpu project in particular. Harmony expects that if Wafi-Golpu is developed, it will shift the company\u2019s geographical mix from more than 90% South African production to 75% domestic output and 25% offshore. Harmony, in December 2022, also acquired the Eva Copper project and surrounding exploration tenements from Copper Mountain Mining Corporation.",

The lender predicts the currency to gradually fall toward 84.40 per dollar, while researcher QuantEco Research targets 84.50 and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. expects a decline to 84.25.\n\u201cGlobal headwinds from geopolitical risks and slower pace of monetary easing in the US amid robust data are expected to weigh on the rupee in the near term,\u201d said Upasna Bhardwaj, chief economist at Kotak in Mumbai. Foreign portfolio outflows from India and other EMs are a reflection of this uncertainty as funds move to China on hopes of its recovery, she said.\nGlobal funds have pulled $9.1 billion from Indian equities this month amid expensive valuations and a shift toward China. Even India\u2019s index-eligible bonds, which had been luring about $2 billion in inflows each month since their inclusion in global bond indexes in June, saw two straight weeks of outflows this month.\nThe rupee fell to a record low of about 84.10 to a dollar earlier in October, and closed at 84.07 on Monday. Barclays strategists led by Lemon Zhang believe the Reserve Bank of India let the rupee fall past 84 because of the sharp rally in the currency\u2019s nominal effective exchange rate since end-September.\nTraders said the central bank had defended the 84 level for two months, armed with almost $700 billion in foreign reserves. The authority\u2019s tight grip over the currency has kept speculators at bay, making a sharp depreciation unlikely and turning the rupee into one of most stable among emerging markets.\nThis strategy has meant the rupee has outperformed its Asian peers during periods of dollar strength, and lagged behind when the greenback weakened.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not managing the exchange rate \u2014 the rupee is depreciating vis-a-vis the dollar and we buy dollars whenever there is an opportunity,\u201d Governor Shaktikanta Das said at a Bloomberg event on Friday.\nHigher US yields ahead of the US elections next month and a possible slowdown in debt flows may contribute to the pressure on the rupee, according to Elara Securities.\n\u201cWe see the rupee gradually moving into a zone where the risks are becoming more prominent vs one-two quarters ago,\u201d Garima Kapoor, an economist at Elara, wrote in a note.

Prices will likely range between 3%-4% over the next decade, he predicted in a recent interview on Blockwork's Forward Guidance podcast.\n\"You've got all these sources of sustained inflation coming at us,\" McDonald said, pointing to price pressures stemming from reshoring, government stimulus, and a strong labor market.\nThose pressures are exacerbated by the fact that geopolitical conflict is on the rise. War itself is inflationary, McDonald said, pointing to the stagflationary crisis in the 70s that coincided with the Vietnam War.\n\"So we're coming into this more sustained inflationary regime,\" he warned.\nBut that could actually be good news for \"inflation beneficiaries\" \u2014 or areas of the market that will actually soar as prices remain elevated. Those beneficiaries include assets like nickel, aluminum, uranium, copper, gold, oil, and gas, McDonald said, estimating that the energy grid alone was likely worth around $2 trillion.\nThe shift will pull a tremendous amount of money from popular growth stocks, like the Magnificent Seven, to hard assets and commodities, he added. Some of those assets are already seeing an uptick in interest, with gold prices surging to a record high this week.\n\"We're talking about a multi-trillion dollar migration of capital and nobody's prepared for it,\" McDonald said.\nInvestors, though, are largely expecting inflation to return to back to its long-run target over the next year. 1-year inflation expectations dropped to 2.07% in March, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. Prices have already cooled dramatically from their highs of 2022, with consumer prices rising just 3.2% in February.\nMcDonald is among Wall Street's most bearish prognosticators at the moment, repeatedly sounding the alarm on stocks and the path of inflation. In March, he predicted the stock market could crash as much as 30% over the next two months, thanks to the impact of higher interest rates on the economy. He made the same prediction in 2023, the year stocks actually soared 25% higher.\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

Outside, an Elvis statue stands with a permanently cocked hip and a guitar in hand, while the King\u2019s hits blast onto the street.\nThe shop, which his family has owned for four generations, sits at an economic borderline.\nOne block north, in the heart of a revitalized downtown, tourists and locals can pay $200 a night to stay at one of El Paso's fanciest hotels, smoke a $45 cigar and drink craft cocktails at a bar covered by an original Tiffany stained-glass dome.\nOne block south, shoppers wheeling metal carts flock to buy made-in-China knockoff purses, discount lingerie and sportswear, and other items both retail and wholesale.\nIt's an urban metaphor for the U.S. economy's uneven recovery.\nSome Americans \u2013 people with retirement plans, savings and stock holdings \u2013 may gripe about inflation and the economy, but they're doing all right.\nOthers are surviving pawn to pawn.\n'American households do not have $1,000'\nThe pawn shop, for those who don't have a credit card or a bank account, acts like a sort of rainy day fund.\nPawn shop owners like Baron lend money to customers, secured by the item pawned. They hold the merchandise in safekeeping during the term of the loan, and sometimes a grace period, until the customer pays back the loan plus interest and fees.\nLoans typically last 30 to 90 days. But right now, customers are pawning and not coming back to reclaim their rings or belt buckles.\n\"Pawn balances have risen across the country in the past two years, said Laura Wasileski, spokeswoman for the National Pawnbrokers Association.\nThe reasons, she said, include \"cost-of-living increases, the lack of access to credit, short-term emergencies, and the fact that 50% of American households do not have $1,000 in savings to cover those emergencies.\"\nNearly 6 million, or 4.5%, of households in the U.S. had no bank account in 2021, according to the latest survey data available from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the agency that insures the banking system.\nPeople of color, those with less education, lower incomes, disabilities and single-mother households were more likely to lack bank access, according to the FDIC.\nA fifth of survey respondents said they didn\u2019t keep a bank account because they didn\u2019t have enough money to meet the minimum balance requirements \u2012 often $100 to a few hundred dollars.\nA repeat customer tries to beat inflation\nAt Baron\u2019s shop one recent afternoon, Arturo Washington was less worried about minimum balance requirements than he was about filling his gas tank.\nWashington, 74, leaned into the pawn counter and asked what he could get for putting up an electric guitar. Over his head a neon sign glowed in Spanish with the words \u201cI buy gold and silver.\u201d\nThe retired repairman knew the pawnshop clerk by name. He had been a customer at Baron\u2019s shop for nearly 20 years. The clerk offered him $300 for the guitar. A gentle negotiation ensued.\n\u201cCould you give me $350 today?\u201d Washington asked.\nHe had to make an hour\u2019s drive for some appliance parts, he told her, and needed a full tank of gas, plus money for the parts. Sweetly, the pawnshop clerk said she couldn\u2019t give him that much, but she\u2019d bump him to $325. Washington thanked her and walked out with his cash.\n\u201cSometimes I get stuck, economically speaking,\u201d he said in Spanish. \u201cSo I come and pawn things, and that\u2019s how I make ends meet.\u201d\nBig pawnshop companies see inventory rise\nWhat Baron sees from the counter of his family-owned store tracks with national trends.\n\u201cWhen times are good and people have money, there\u2019s going to be more money coming in. People will be buying the stuff,\u201d Baron said. \u201cWhen people need money, there\u2019s going to be more money going out of the store, which is what\u2019s happening now.\u201d\nTwo of the largest, publicly traded pawnshop corporations in the U.S. \u2013 which between them own roughly 1,700 pawnshops nationwide \u2013 are also reporting growing inventory and increased demand for short-term loans.\nFirstCash Holdings Inc. operates nearly 1,200 pawnshops under the FirstCash and Cash America brands in 29 states and the District of Columbia. The company reported \u201crecord pawn receivables\u201d in its most recent year-end earnings report and a 10% increase in inventory at its U.S. stores.\nEZCORP Inc. also owns 530 pawnshops in the U.S. and reported an 8% increase in inventory at U.S. stores in the company's latest earnings report. The \u201cchallenging macro-economic backdrop\u201d continued to fuel demand for short-term cash loans, the company said.\nThe price of gold \u2013 which investors turn to as a hedge against inflation \u2013 has helped drive up pawn inventory, too, as consumers of varying income levels pawn gold items to cash in on the favorable market price. An ounce of gold hit an all-time record \u2013 over $2,200 per troy ounce \u2013 this week.\nLime prices a sign of sour economy\nWashington, the El Paso customer, blames Biden for his financial constraints. High inflation has hurt people like him on a fixed income, he said.\n\u201cFor those of us who are retired, the economy is going very badly,\u201d Washington said.\n\u201cThe cost of basic foods is very, very, very expensive,\" he said. \"And every day they raise prices more on basic foods. A lime, a small one, is 35 cents. It\u2019s not right.\u201d\nBaron, the shop's owner, tried to pinpoint the moment the economy soured for his customers.\n\u201cDefinitely since COVID, but even before COVID,\u201d he said, \u201cI don't want to get political, but even during the Trump administration beginning, people seemed like they were a little dry.\u201d\nLauren Villagran can be reached at lvillagran@usatoday.com.",

At yesterday's closing share prices, G2 and Reunion, had combined fully diluted market capitalizations of CDN$ 1.34 billion and estimated combined project EVs of CDN$ 1.16 billion, equating to a valuation of USD108 per ounce Au.\nWhile Yono contains no defined resources, and has not seen any modern exploration, it is at its closest point ~170m from defined resources, considerable artisanal mining has been conducted on the property, and surrounding exploration data as contained in the NI 43-101 reports of G2 and Reunion suggest the property is prospective as outlined below:\nBrief Property Description.\nKey Features of the Yono Property are illustrated in Figures 1-9 and elucidated below:\nThe Yono Property is completely surrounded by the Oko (G2) and Oko West (Reunion) Projects (Figure 1);\nThe Oko Project contains resources in two deposits Oko Main Zone \"OMZ\" and Ghanie, while further south Oko West hosts the Kairuni Deposit. In closest proximity to Yono is Ghanie which strikes sub-parallel to the boundary of Yono and dips 60-70\u00b0 to the east (Figure 2);\nFrom the boundary of Yono, at its southern end, Ghanie is located 170m to the east and at its northern end 390m (Figure 2);\nAt its southern end, the Ghanie resource constraining pit shell is ~268m deep and ~306m deep at central Ghanie (Figure 3). As documented in G2's most recent NI 43-101 report, the pit shell was calculated at a gold price of USD$1900 per ounce with slopes of 35\u00b0 in saprolite and 45\u00b0 in resh rock. No plan view of the pit shell has been published by G2, but we believe from given data its western boundary will be located within tens of metres of the southern part of Yono.\nAs last reported, Ghanie's open pit contained resources totaled 236k + 476k ounces in indicated and inferred categories with an additional 128k of inferred underground resources;\nAs a result of good, recently reported, gold intercepts encountered at depth and outside of resource wireframes (See G2 press release www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/06/25/2903617/0/en/Drilling-Continues-to-Expand-Gold-Zones-at-OKO-10-0m-9-7-g-t-Au-52-3m-2-1-g-t-Au.html)2 drilling is being planned by G2 to test Ghanie along its entire strike to a depth of 500m by year's end (See interview from 22:44 minutes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JW-O7KxvNF4 );\nBetween Ghanie and Yono there is a yet lightly explored zone of mineralization- Ghanie West. The Zone lies along the western contact of the Ghanie /Karuini footwall Granitoid whose eastern contact forms the footwall to the Ghanie and Karuini deposits. As such this zone \"mirrors\" the Ghanie \u2013 Karouni mineralization along the lower contact of the Granitoid (Figure 4);\nSince 2016 the \"Ghanie West\" Zone has seen artisanal mining of in-situ mineralization and overlying colluvium over a strike length of ~ 900m. The pace of artisanal working picked up in early 2023 after a trenching program by G2 evidently exposed gold mineralization. However, no results for Ghanie West apart from drill hole OKD-36 (see https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/07/14/2061788/0/en/G2-Goldfields-extends-strike-length-to-1-7-km-at-Oko-and-Reports-17-8-g-t-Au-over-2-5-m-9-5-g-t-Au-over-4-4-m-21-1-g-t-Au-over-2-1-m-and-26-1-g-t-Au-over-1-6-m-in-three-separate-ho.html)3 drilled at the northern end of the zone have been reported by G2 (Figure 4).\nGhanie West potentially strikes into Yono or at least \"hugs\" the boundary within G2's tenure in its southern ~ 400m of strike (Figure 4).\nSituated ~ 700m north, along a direction of 026\u00b0, of Yono lies OMZ (686koz @ 9.03g/t Au & 495koz @ 6.4g/t Au of Indicated and Inferred Resources). The 026\u00b0direction corresponds to the mean intersection lineation (L23: 058\u00b0 to 026\u00b0) of measured S2 (008\u00b0/88\u00b0W) & S3 (357\u00b0/68\u00b0E)4 surfaces at OMZ. This intersection lineation corresponds to the major plunge direction of high-grade shoots at OMZ. S2 is an axial planar foliation developed during a D2 event while S3 fabrics and surfaces are related to later D3 shearing (Figure 5)5.\nWithin Yono, and coincident with the projection of the 026\u00b0 L23 lineation direction is a prominent linear ravine which has been worked by artisanal miners over a length of 550m. This ravine potentially indicates a yet to be discovered gold source within Yono. Workings in the upper part of the ravine have included considerable colluvial material. (Figure 5);\nSoil sampling by G2 to the west of the Oko Main Zone shows elongation of 100-500ppb values in a southwesterly direction towards Yono (Figure 6);\nWest of Yono, shallow (~10-20m) vertical geochemical RC drilling by Reunion to sample beneath duricrust cover, has outlined several zones of gold anomalism (50ppb - >500ppb Au). One consistent trend of persistently higher anomalism is in line with the L23 direction from the Oko Main Zone, soil anomalism (reported by G2) and the 550m worked ravine within Yono (Figure7). This zone of gold anomalism appears associated with the contact between high and low magnetic zones which is trending into Yono (Figure 8). In addition to being structurally controlled gold mineralization within the district tends to be associated within contacts and most prominently contacts between fine grained sediments and any of andesites/mafic volcanics/granitoids or coarse-grained sediments.\nAlong and within the northern boundary of Yono, is an area of substantial alluvial and colluvial mining. Of particular note, a prominent hill underlying the eastern part of Yono has seen extensive colluvial mining going upslope (Figure 9) from the valley floor for some distance. Thus, a potential gold source within Yono up-hill of these workings is indicated.\nIn summary artisanal workings, surrounding geochemical surveys and measured structural trends are indicative of potential gold mineralisation within Yono and depending on results of further exploration, resource conversions, mining method choice and economic optimizations, the Yono property may impinge on the extraction of resources immediately adjacent to the Property. Finally Yono's close proximity to known large gold resources, brings the property intrinsic value for the siting of future potential mine related infrastructure such as lay down areas, waste dumps and dewatering bores etc.\n_______________________________________ |\n1 Resources reported from: |\nReunion- G Mining Services: NI43-101 Technical Report \u2026\u2026prepared for Reunion Gold Corporation\u2026. 11th April 2024 |\nG2- Mincon: NI 43-101 Technical Report and Mineral Resource Estimate for the Oko Gold Property \u2026.. May 15, 2024 |\n2 According to previous exchange complaints, results from news releases of other companies cannot be reported by a third party company unless they have also been reported in a 43-101 report.

Brett Davis et al June 2023 \u2013 Which information was incorporated into G2's most recent 43-101 |\nKey Terms of the Yono Purchase and Joint Venture Agreement\nTo acquire a 65% interest in the Yono Property (Guyana Mining Permit No 954/2014) Tajiri will issue the vendor, Nebula Resources Inc. or its shareholders (\"Nebula\"), 40,000,000 shares of Tajiri. Nebula is a private Guyana registered company, and will retain a 35% interest in the Property, free carried until completion of a positive bankable feasibility study.\nUpon closing of the purchase the property will be transferred to a new Guyana trust company, whose only asset will be the Yono Property. Trust deeds will be made in favour of Tajiri (65%) and Nebula (35%). This is necessitated at this point in time by the property being a Mining Permit which may only be owned by citizens of Guyana or corporations whose shareholders are 100% owned by citizens of Guyana.\nUpon eventual conversion to either a Prospecting or Mining License (which may be owned by foreign entities), ownership of 65% of the shares in the trust company shall be transferred to Tajiri or its nominee.\nThe acquisition of the interest in the Property is subject to Exchange approval and to the receipt of shareholder approval and the execution of relevant deeds by Nebula.\nUnder the agreement Tajiri has no mandated expenditure commitments.\nAn exploration joint venture will be formed on completion of the acquisition of the Tajiri's 65% interest. Tajiri will be the manager of the Joint Venture unless it relinquishes its position and withdraws as manager, becomes insolvent or is in material default of the agreement where this is not remedied within 60 days.\nEach party is entitled to appoint two representatives to the management committee of the joint venture with the voting power of each party to be in accordance with the percentage interest of the party with Tajiri therefore having a controlling vote while its solely funds the project. All matters at meetings of the management committee will be decided by a majority of votes except the following matters which will require a unanimous decision:\nDisposal of the Property or other joint venture property;\nExploration outside the property;\nConversion of the title of Property (Permit to Licence), applications to mine;\nAbandonment or surrender of any part of the Property;\nLicencing third parties to mine the property and the rates of NSRs or royalties payable to the Parties;\nSettlement of claims in excess of USD50,000 or borrowing more than USD50,000 in relation to the property;\nA decision to undertake a bankable feasibility study.\nA decision to proceed to mine development.\nIn the event of the Parties unanimously approving the decision of a Party to dispose of its interest, Each Party shall have first rights of refusal to the interest the other Party is disposing.interest.\nUpon completion of a positive bankable feasibility study a Mining Joint Venture Agreement will be executed and each party will be required to contribute their proportion of costs or risk dilution of their interest. If Nebula elects not to participate and fund its share, Nebula may convert its 35% interest to either a 10% NPI or 2.5% NSR. In this event, Nebula's full 35% interest will be reinstated if under any bankable feasibility study 70% of the first 24 months of the budget or 20% of the total estimated budget has not been expended or contractually committed within 3 years.\nThe agreements otherwise contain terms and conditions standard for agreements of this nature.\nTwo directors of the Tajiri - Messrs. Dominic O'Sullivan and Robert Power are indirect shareholders of Nebula. As such the transaction can be considered to be non-arm's length, or a related party transaction under Multi-lateral Instrument 61-110 (\"MI 61-101\"). The transaction will be exempt from the formal valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements of MI 61-101 as neither the fair market value of the securities to be issued to the insiders, nor the consideration for such securities, will exceed 25% of the Company's market capitalization.\nComments\nCEO and President, Graham Kevil noted:\n\"The board and I believe this acquisition is compelling value for Tajiri. The purchase of 65% of Yono, located in the heart of what appears to be a growing Tier 1 gold asset is a coup for the Company. While the retained interest of the vendor is large it recognizes the special circumstances of the Property's location which may generate significant returns for Tajiri shareholders and the Vendor irrespective of future expenditures and the discovery of any exploitable ounces within Yono\"\nQualified Person\nThe Qualified Person under National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects for this news release is Dominic O'Sullivan a geologist, member of the AusIMM, Executive Chairman of Tajiri who has reviewed and approved its contents.\nOn Behalf of the Board,\nTajiri Resources Corp.\nGraham Keevil,\nPresident & CEO\nAbout Tajiri\nTajiri Resources Corp. is a junior gold exploration and development Company with exploration assets located in two of the worlds least explored and highly prolific greenstone belts of Burkina Faso, West Africa and Guyana, South America.

However, thanks to the notoriously volatile price of Bitcoin, the sum now totals \u00a33bn, as the price of a single Bitcoin has more than doubled from just over $30,000 to its current value of around $65,000.\nEarlier this year, the Crown Prosecution Service obtained a property freezing order against Ms Wen, meaning the cryptoassets are now held by the Government. A civil recovery process is underway to show that the Bitcoin was illegally acquired and, should it be successful, Ms Wen will be required to forfeit it and the British Government will be able to do with it as it pleases.\nAnother nation in possession of a large cryptocurrency reserve, Germany finished selling 50,000 Bitcoin earlier this month worth approximately $3bn or around \u00a32.3bn, the majority of which it too had seized from criminals.\nThe mass sell-off was one of the factors that caused Bitcoin\u2019s price to slump from around $65,000 to $55,000 at the end of June, though it has swiftly recovered.\nRachel Reeves may soon be able to follow Germany\u2019s example and bolster the nation\u2019s finances by selling its newly acquired cryptoassets \u2013 but should she?\nGordon Brown sold over half of the UK\u2019s gold reserves in 1999 at historic lows\nIn 1999, Mr Brown made the decision to sell 56pc of the UK\u2019s gold reserves \u2013 or 400 tonnes \u2013 at an average cost of $275 an ounce, for an approximate total of $3.5bn. The timing could hardly have been worse.\nThe asset\u2019s price had fallen steadily from its 1980 peak of $686.50, and gold experts at the time raised concerns that it was at a relative low, and could quickly recover \u2013 and it did. By the mid-point of the 2000s it had already doubled in price.\nToday, gold\u2019s price is around $2,470 an ounce, nine times what Gordon Brown sold it for. If he\u2019d held onto it, the 400 tonnes he\u2019d sold then would today be worth $31.5bn, or over \u00a324bn. This would give the current Labour government an additional nearly \u00a35bn each year during its parliament.\nGiven what was with hindsight a catastrophic error on behalf of one Labour chancellor, would it be prudent for another to learn from the mistake and hold onto the vast reserve of Bitcoin that has fallen into her lap?\nCan a Bitcoin windfall avoid tax rises?\nIt\u2019s no secret that Labour is considering reforms to several taxes, including inheritance and capital gains, to raise cash.\nUnlike the gold that Gordon Brown sold, the price of Bitcoin can be incredibly volatile over even short timeframes. After cryptocurrency exchange FTX went bust in late 2022, the price of Bitcoin crashed from over $60,000 to $16,000 in just three months.\nWhen Mr Brown sold the gold, it had experienced a major slump during the two decades prior, and experts warned the price could be near its bottom. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has enjoyed a strong rally of late \u2013 it has climbed 400pc since it reached a low of around $16,000 in December 2022.\nThe pragmatic argument goes that speculating on Bitcoin bears little difference to gambling \u2013 and the chancellor should not gamble with public funds. IfMs Reeves would not choose to buy \u00a33bn worth of Bitcoin at the asset\u2019s current price with the state\u2019s money, it stands to reason she should also sell it immediately.\nEven by government standards \u00a33bn is a substantial amount of money. In terms of last financial year\u2019s spending, it is almost 5pc of the defence budget, 8pc of the housing and environment budget, or 6pc of the public order and safety budget.\nLabour needs to find money to fund its ambitions of improving education, lowering crime and giving the NHS a boost among other things. An additional \u00a3600m a year over its current term would not go amiss.\nIf Ms Reeves misses an opportunity to sell our Bitcoin for \u00a33bn while she has the chance and the asset\u2019s price plummets, how will she be able to look the taxpayer in the eye and justify future raids on their finances?\nJason Hollands, managing director at tax firm Evelyn Partners, said: \u201cThis is clearly a very different set of circumstances from the gold reserves that were legitimately built up by the UK, that Gordon Brown then chose to sell off in 1999 with the aim of diversifying the UK\u2019s reserves, which proved unwise with the benefit of hindsight.\u201d\nMr Hollands also suggested that further crypto windfalls are a possibility.\n\u201cCriminals use cryptocurrencies to move large sums of money rather than the formal banking system where suspicious transactions are monitored and reported,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe may well see increasing sums of cryptocurrencies seized over time, which, if they cannot be traced back to victims, are going to find themselves sold off to then fill the public coffers. Successful confiscations of significant sums could provide a surprise boon to the UK\u2019s creaking public finances.\u201d\nShould the Government own a small amount of Bitcoin?\nWhile there is a strong case for selling Bitcoin at its current price, getting rid of it all could prove shortsighted. For many who have bought and held Bitcoin since its inception in 2009, their investment has been profitable \u2013 the currency is about 10pc below its all-time high.\nFor some investors, Bitcoin\u2019s rally is only just getting started. The asset is scarce by design: there is a maximum supply of 21 million, of which almost 20 million are already in circulation. Bitcoin \u201cminers\u201d can earn the currency by providing computing power to maintain the blockchain, a public ledger of transactions.\nThe amount of Bitcoin given to miners as a reward for running the blockchain is divided in two every four years \u2013 this event is known as the \u201chalving\u201d, after which the cryptocurrency tends to enjoy a rise in value.\nIt\u2019s impossible to predict where Bitcoin\u2019s price will go next with even a mild degree of certainty.\nBut given the cryptoasset\u2019s resilience over the past decade \u2013 and the harsh lessons inflicted on previous chancellors that with, the benefit of hindsight, have been too trigger happy \u2013 retaining even a small number of the Bitcoin that the Treasury may soon find itself in possession of could go down as a stroke of genius in years to come.",

Inflation in Canada has remained stable around 2% annually for the past 30 years, contrasting with the 8% and 13% levels seen in the 1970s and 1980s. Although experts anticipate a decrease in inflation, reaching a stable 2% inflation rate is not projected until the end of 2024. Despite an overall decline in inflation, food price inflation is expected to hover around 4-5% due to factors such as the Canadian dollar's weakness affecting world market trading. Similarly, housing-related expenses are also predicted to rise, surpassing the Bank of Canada's 2% inflation target, particularly in the first half of the year.\nOn the other hand, Deloitte predicts that inflation will return to the target level by mid-2025. The Bank of Canada is anticipated to commence rate cuts once the path to achieving a 2% target becomes evident, likely in the spring of 2024, leading to a rebound in the latter part of the year. Subsequently, there is an expectation of an acceleration in real economic growth, projecting an average growth rate of 0.4% for 2024. The robust momentum is foreseen to persist into 2025, with the economy experiencing a 3% growth as consumer spending increases and exports benefit from the opening of the LNG Canada export terminal in British Columbia.\nAccording to Oxford Economics, key themes for Canada in 2024 include a moderate recession followed by a gradual recovery, driven by factors such as rising debt service costs and housing corrections. The migration-led population boom is projected to continue, impacting the labor market and housing supply. The Bank of Canada is anticipated to initiate an easing cycle as inflation returns to the target of 2%, with fiscal policy facing challenges amid the economic situation. Wildcards include potential disruptions such as wildfires, extreme weather, labor strikes, and supply chain issues, along with external risks related to slowing global growth and geopolitical tensions.\nWhile the economy is somewhat rocky at the moment, investors can buy Canadian stocks now and reap the rewards later.

We don\u2019t hold gold in client portfolios, we hold gold royalty companies. The two have surprisingly little in common. The gold royalty company generates very impressive profits even if the gold price never rises, and it earns those profits year after year. Here is a long-term chart of Franco Nevada Corp., the premier gold royalty company vs. gold itself: a comparable gold price today than a decade ago, yet Franco Nevada returned 12.5% annually, matching the S&P 500 return, despite its nearsole source of revenues unchanged. What will Franco Nevada\u2019s earnings and share price do if gold rises over the course of a decade?\u201d\n13. Bausch Health Companies Inc.

The share price increased by one third. Notably, the portfolio generated significant returns from energy stocks, including Suncor, Tenaris, Imperial Oil and tangentially Alimentation Couche-Tarde and Seven & i Holdings, both of which are in the gas station business.

(NYSE:NTR) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:\n\u201cHowever, we believe this is exactly the kind of environment that separates the highest-quality companies from their peers and allows them to strengthen their competitive positioning. For example, Nutrien Ltd. (NYSE:NTR), a Canadian fertilizer company, was a top contributor during the quarter. While the war in Ukraine and economic sanctions on Russia have significantly reduced the output of two of the world\u2019s largest agricultural producers, Nutrien has benefited from a strong global agricultural cycle and from farmers seeking to increase their output and capitalize on higher agricultural prices.\u201d\n9.

Commodity businesses are difficult to forecast, and the industry has long been plagued by poor incentive structures and principal-agent issues. The management of many of the smaller companies in the industry are notable for seldom being burdened with an abundance of ethics. Further, the entire industry has historically been dominated by a \u201cdrill at all costs\u201d mentality, with little regard to returns on capital. That is, until recently, as social concerns have helped propel both a sell-off in oil and gas company stock prices and a massive reduction in capital expenditures. The lack of capital expenditures has created a favorable environment for higher commodity prices. As a result, we are beginning to see the sector as a more appealing hunting ground.\n8.

Although we have long respected the company, we became shareholders when they acquired our portfolio holding, Kirkland Lake Gold.

So whenever I see the price has pulled back, I rush to Costco to buy one.\u201d\n\u2022USD\n(GC=F)\nSethia visited his local Costco with his parents on Sept. 28 while the store was promoting one ounce gold bars stamped to mark the Indian festival Diwali. A Costco greeter clutching a laminated paper sheet advertising the item was directing shoppers to the center of the store, where the gold is displayed in a glass case. A small sign showed the price \u2014 $2,699.99. While Sethia didn\u2019t buy this time, he did purchase two bars at this location in the past four months to guard against inflation.\nSethia\u2019s experience is reflective of a larger trend that\u2019s driving shoppers to seek out gold at the big-box store even as prices of the precious metal hit all-time highs. While the retailer doesn\u2019t disclose much about its gold sales, a Bloomberg survey revealed how hard it is for the company to keep shelves stocked with the precious metal. About 77% of surveyed Costco outlets that stock bullion bars were sold out in the first week of October, based on calls to 101 stores in 46 states \u2014 all the stores surveyed had received fresh stock of the gold products in recent weeks.\nSpot gold has jumped nearly 30% this year, successively hitting record highs. Its ferocious rally makes it not only one of the best-performing commodities, but also means that metal has outperformed US equities and bonds. The surge has been driven by its appeal as a haven asset in times of geopolitical and economic uncertainty and its role as diversification play to safeguard wealth. It surpassed $2,600 an ounce last month, bolstered by the Federal Reserve\u2019s shift to interest-rate cuts. Non-yielding gold tends to rise in a low-rate environment.\n\u2022USD\n(COST)\nA flurry of buying from Costco is happening amid signs elsewhere that cash-strapped Americans are cashing in on gold\u2019s rally. New York\u2019s pawn shops and jewelers have seen a flood of sellers. Sales of American Eagle gold coins \u2014 a proxy for retail buying \u2014 tumbled 64% in the January-September period from a year earlier, according to US Mint data.\nCostco is the \u201cone bright spot\u201d in the consumer gold-buying market, said Nicky Shiels, head of metals strategy at Geneva-based MKS PAMP SA.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole new cohort of retail buyers,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do think that\u2019s positive in the medium to long term, given the fact that Costco has managed to bring in new buyers into the precious space.\u201d\nCostco started selling bullion in June 2023 in US stores and on its website. The Swiss-made 24 karat bars are small \u2014 about the size of those mini chocolate bars handed out on Halloween, but not as thick \u2014 and encased in cardboard-and-plastic packaging. While the retailer doesn\u2019t disclose how much it sells, the buzz created by shoppers in person and on the Internet offers a snapshot of its popularity.\nCostco customers, who pay membership fees, tend to have higher household incomes than those frequenting other retail chains. Those buying gold seem to be wooed by the ease of dealing with a big-box outlet to collect the longstanding store of wealth. Johnny Lee, a 40-year-old content creator from Los Angeles, bought gold bars from Costco twice in the past year: once for gifts and a second time \u201cjust for the excitement of it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to make a purchase knowing that there has been historical value in it,\u201d Lee said, adding that he suspects many Costco shoppers are getting swept up by a trend. \u201cI feel like people buying gold bars at Costco is kind of a symbol of how little folks know about buying gold in general.\u201d\nIn a rare public comment about its bullion, Costco executives noted the popularity of its gold offerings during a September 2023 earnings call. In its fiscal first quarter, the company said it sold more than $100 million in gold bars \u2014 equal to about 51,740 ounces, based on calculations using average gold prices during that period.\nGold and silver sales continue to be \u201ca meaningful part\u201d of e-commerce sales growth, Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip said by email to Bloomberg.\n\u201cWe are glad to be able to offer gold and silver items for our members,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great example of our merchants constantly finding new ways to deliver uniqueness and value.\u201d\nThere are benefits buying from Costco. The retailer offers 2% cash rewards for using an affiliated Citi (C) credit card on purchases at Costco. Shoppers also get a 2% reward on purchases with an executive membership, which costs $130 a year. Costco was selling one ounce bullion bars on Sept. 28 for a 1.6% premium to spot gold\u2019s price \u2014 below what precious metals retailers charge. Add a potential 4% in rewards, and Costco members get an even bigger break.\n\u201cIt seemed like a too-good-to-be-true deal,\u201d said Josh Young, who purchased a gold bar and coin from Costco in the past year. The Houston money manager said he purchased the items as insurance against rising geopolitical and financial risks, including \u201csignificant hyperinflation.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s physical and gold does have a long history of being a store of value even though there\u2019s no cash flow from it,\u201d Young, 41, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a good personal diversifier.\u201d\nCostco\u2019s precious-metals foray is well-documented online. Reddit forums share tips on which stores have inventory. Those who score show off their bounty on YouTube and swap stories on social media. California\u2019s Angel Groff snapped up two gold bars from Costco last year for about $1,950 each, recording the online purchase for the 40,000 fans of her \u201cmidlifecrisisgirl\u201d TikTok account.\n\u201cI bought it impulsively,\u201d said the 42\u2014year-old, who usually posts about jewelry and Hermes bags. \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst-case scenario? It\u2019s a small way to diversify funds and if it goes well, it goes well. If it doesn\u2019t, I can make jewelry out of it.\u201d\nSome followers called it a dumb move. Today, each bar is worth about $700 more.\nSigns of robust bullion demand at Costco won\u2019t move prices because sales volumes aren\u2019t large enough, according to Philip Newman, managing director at consultancy Metals Focus.\nStill, the buying can signal strong support for the metal.\n\u201cPeople discount retail activity because there\u2019s an arrogance that thinks that retail is \u2018dumb buying\u2019 \u2014 I don\u2019t agree with that,\u201d said Matt Schwab of Greenwich, Connecticut-based hedge fund Quantix Commodities. Costco gold buying \u201ccan provide a form of constant support, akin to central bank buying.\u201d\nCostco\u2019s offerings make gold ownership more accessible than ever, said Stefan Gleason, CEO of Money Metals Exchange, one of the top US precious metal retailers. He estimates that, outside of jewelry, less than 2% of Americans own gold and silver.\n\u201cEven an increase to 5% to 10% ownership would be dramatic \u2014 and would likely disrupt the market,\u201d he said.",

If negative surprises are avoided this year, he expects gold to possibly rally beyond $2,500 in 2024.\nGiven that gold is a safe-haven asset, international face-offs have prompted more investors to buy the bullion. Meanwhile, US sanctions on Russian reserves sparked central banks to snap up the metal at a record pace.\nThe asset also benefits from a broader metals rally, with commodities such as copper and silver also breaching their records. Spot silver climbed past an 11-year high on Monday.\n\"Silver has made incredible gains over the past fortnight, and it does look overbought at current levels.

Therefore, attributing economic performance solely to the president\u2019s party affiliation can be overly simplistic and potentially misleading.\u2019\nIndeed, the legislative branch also plays a crucial role in shaping economic policy. A president\u2019s ability to implement their economic agenda often depends on the composition of Congress. For example, a president facing a divided government may struggle to pass significant economic reforms, regardless of party affiliation.\nStill, there is widespread belief that Democratic administrations tend to focus more on fiscal stimulus and social welfare programs, which can boost consumer spending and economic growth in the short term. On the other hand, Republican administrations often emphasize tax cuts and deregulation, which can stimulate business investment and long-term economic growth.\nThe U.S. Key macro indicators under four presidents (2004\u20132024)\nSource: Octa\nAt the same time, both bad and good events happen, regardless of who is in the White House. \u2018Quite frankly, sometimes it\u2019s just pure luck that defines Presidents\u2019 track record on the economy. For example, Obama entered the White House when the U.S. economy was just about to start recovering following the great financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, whereas Trump may be said to be less fortunate as he faced the unprecedented Covid crisis during the final year of his presidency\u2019, says Kar Yong Ang, Octa\u2019s analyst. Overall, judging by historical macro indicators, there is no definite conclusion to make about which President is better for the economy.\nU.S. Stocks\nThe U.S. stocks tend to experience increased volatility in the months leading up to an election. This is largely due to the uncertainty surrounding potential policy changes that could affect international trade, economic growth, and geopolitical stability. Therefore, market participants often engage in \u2018wait-and-see\u2019 behaviour, holding off on major investment decisions until the election outcome is clear. Historically, the stock market tends to perform better in the year following an election, particularly if the incumbent party wins, as this suggests policy continuity.\nWhile elections can certainly stir immediate reactions, historical data reveals that their long-term impact on financial markets tends to be limited. Market performance over the medium to long term is more often influenced by broader economic parameters like inflation trends rather than who wins the election.\nDow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) performance under four presidents (2004\u20132024)\nSource: Octa\nHistorically, sectors like healthcare, energy, technology, and finance react differently to election results due to their sensitivity to legislative changes. The 2016 U.S. election serves as a notable example of markets reacting strongly to the election results, anticipating tax cuts and regulatory reforms that boosted market sentiment.\nU.S. Dollar\nBoth domestic and international perceptions of the candidates\u2019 economic policies influence the U.S. dollar\u2019s performance during the election years. A candidate perceived as fiscally conservative might strengthen the dollar due to expectations of reduced government spending and lower inflation. Conversely, a candidate favouring expansive fiscal policies could lead to a weaker dollar due to concerns over increased debt.\nTrade policies are another crucial factor. A candidate with a protectionist stance might introduce tariffs or renegotiate trade deals, which can affect the dollar\u2019s value. Protectionist policies can lead to a stronger dollar in the short term due to reduced imports, but they might also result in retaliatory measures from trade partners, which could weaken the dollar in the long run.\nGeopolitical stability and foreign relations are additional aspects that can affect the dollar during the election periods. A candidate perceived as more stable and predictable in foreign policy might boost the investors\u2019 confidence, leading to a stronger dollar. On the other hand, a candidate whose policies are seen as potentially destabilizing could lead to a weaker dollar as investors seek alternative assets.\nThe U.S Dollar Index (DXY) performance under four presidents (2004\u20132024)\nSource: Octa\nOver the past 20 years, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has performed better under Democratic Presidents and had negative returns under Republican leadership. However, as with the U.S. stock indices, it\u2019s crucial not to oversimplify this trend. The U.S. dollar is a global reserve currency influenced by a myriad of factors beyond just presidential policies.\nGold\nGold, considered a safe-haven asset, typically sees increased demand during election periods marked by uncertainty. Historical data indicates that on a micro level, gold prices tend to rise in the months leading up to an election and may continue to do so if the election results are contested or lead to significant policy shifts.\nHowever, Kar Yong Ang, an Octa analyst, notes: \u2018If we look at the bigger picture, we see that gold price just generally tends to increase in the long-term and the ideological stance of an incumbent U.S. President has very little or no impact on its performance\u2019. Indeed, the value of gold almost doubled during President Obama\u2019s first term in office but experienced a 30% decline during his second term.\nThe U.S Dollar Index (DXY) performance under four residents (2004\u20132024)\nSource: Octa\nAccording to a study by the World Gold Council (WGC), gold typically performs slightly better in the six months leading up to a Republican president\u2019s election and stays flat afterwards. On the other hand, it tends to underperform before a Democratic president\u2019s election and performs just below its long-term average in the six months post-election period.[1] However, WGC admits that these results are statistically insignificant and that gold is responding not to the party affiliation of an elected President but, more likely, to the expected effect of specific policies.\nAbout Octa\nOcta is an international broker that has been providing online trading services worldwide since 2011.",

        "full_text": "MENA's Economic Outlook for 2024 and the Rising Interest in Private Equity and Venture Capital Investments\nAccording to the Middle East and North Africa Economic Update report published by the IMF in April 2024, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region will experience modest growth of 2.7% in 2024, up from 1.9% in 2023. Both oil importers and exporters in the region are expected to grow at similar rates in 2024. The forecasted growth difference between the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) economies and developing oil importers (excluding Egypt) is nearly 1%. GDP per capita is expected to rise by just 1.3% in 2024, driven almost entirely by the GCC economies. The impact of ongoing conflicts has ceased economic activity, particularly in Palestine. In Gaza, economic activity has nearly dropped by 86% in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter in 2022. The Palestinian economy's outlook remains highly uncertain, heavily dependent on the conflict's progression. The disruptions in maritime transportation, particularly through the Suez Canal, affected both regional and global trade.\nOver the past decade, most MENA economies have seen increases in their debt-to-GDP ratios as MENA oil importers struggle to reduce their debt-to-GDP ratios due to high oil prices. Additionally, oil importers have been unable to lower their debt-to-GDP ratios through inflation, mainly due to exchange rate fluctuations and off-budget factors, known as stock-flow adjustments, highlighting the need for greater debt transparency. On the other hand, for MENA oil exporters, periods of high GDP growth are typically associated with smaller increases in nominal debt stocks, leading to a slower rise or even a decrease in the debt-to-GDP ratio.\nHowever, interest in private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) has been surging in the Middle East and Africa, reflecting a notable shift in investment preferences within the region. According to recent data, provided by Preqin, in collaboration with the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), approximately 65% of investors in the region are either planning to maintain or increase their exposure to private equity this year. Similarly, 56% of investors are keen to do the same with their venture capital investments. This growing interest is partly due to the region's historical under-investment combined with an optimistic outlook on the regional economic and market conditions.\nDespite challenges due to geopolitical tensions, venture capital remains a critical component of the investment ecosystem. The sector is expected to recover as it adapts to the current economic conditions. In the Middle East, investor sentiment towards VC and PE is generally positive. A significant portion of regional investors have reported that their PE and VC investments have met or exceeded expectations. Sectors such as fintech, technology, healthcare, and infrastructure are particularly attractive to investors.\nThe Middle East and North Africa region is poised for a modest economic recovery in 2024, however, geopolitical tensions and conflicts continue to pose significant challenges. As MENA economies navigate through fluctuating global conditions and regional disruptions, the interest of private equity and venture capital investors reveals the region's promising outlook for investors and economic stakeholders.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we used Finviz and Yahoo Finance stock screeners plus online rankings to compile an initial list of the 40 largest companies in the Middle East and Africa by market cap. From that list, we narrowed our choices to the 10 stocks that analysts see the most upside to. The list is sorted in ascending order of analysts\u2019 average upside potential, as of August 23. We also included the market cap of the companies as of August 23. The list is sorted in ascending order of their average upside potential as of August 23.\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nAn open pit mine with heavy excavation machinery toiling away against the backdrop of a hidden valley.\nHarmony Gold Mining (NYSE:HMY) is one of the largest gold mining companies in South Africa by production. Almost all of its gold mine assets are located in South Africa, which contributes to 90% of its total gold output. However, the company also has gold and copper assets in Papua New Guinea, and Australia. The company focuses on assets where it believes it can acquire the highest mineral grades to maintain strong operating margins.\nHarmony Gold Mining\u2019s (NYSE:HMY) gold production has shown impressive stability over the past three years. At the start of the financial year 2024, the management had projected that its production would remain stable as compared to the previous year. However, the company significantly exceeded expectations, as the gold production increased by 12% year-over-year in the first half of FY24, reaching 832,000 ounces. This remarkable performance was driven by an 11% increase in recovered grades from its underground gold mines. The strong production momentum continued into the third quarter and the management raised its full-year production target to 1.55 million ounces, surpassing the initial expectation of 1.38 million to 1.47 million ounces. In the latest operational update released on August 26, Harmony Gold announced that it will achieve a full-year production volume of 1.56 million ounces, marking a 6% increase year-over-year, with recovered grades also up 6% to 6.11 g/t.\nGold prices reached an all-time high of $2,531.70 per ounce on August 27, driven by strong demand and favorable market conditions. J.P. Morgan Research forecasts that gold will maintain a stable price of $2,500 per ounce by the end of 2024 and rise to $2,600 per ounce in the first half of 2025. Harmony Gold is exceptionally well-positioned to capitalize on the upward trend in gold prices. This leverage, combined with stronger-than-expected production growth from its core underground assets, sets Harmony Gold apart from its competitors.\nHarmony Gold Mining (NYSE:HMY) is trading 11.11 times its earnings, which is a 31% discount compared to the sector median of 16.10. The company\u2019s earnings are expected to grow by 68.61% this year. In the second quarter, Harmony Gold Mining\u2019s (NYSE:HMY) stock was held by 17 hedge funds with stakes worth $171.88 million. Kopernik Global Investors is the largest shareholder in the company with a stake worth $26.90 million as of June 30. Industry analysts have a consensus on the stock\u2019s Buy rating, setting an average share price target at $10.30, which represents a 92.52% upside potential from its current level.\nOverall HMY ranks 1st on our list of the best Middle East and Africa stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of HMY as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HMY but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.",

Money Baby !!! Commissions!!! Gold has beaten the S&P for decades. The S&P is about to crash by 70% \u2026\u201d\nKiyosaki believes that financial planners have typically guided their clients away from investing in gold, silver and bitcoin due to a lack of commissions. He claims gold has beaten the S&P for years now.\nAs far as Kiyosaki\u2019s claim that the S&P is about to crash by 70%, it\u2019s worth noting that Kiyosaki is known for making dire predictions, like the U.S. economy falling into a depression and the stock market crashing. Just check the related headlines.\nWhy Kiyosaki Says To Invest in Gold, Silver and Bitcoin\nKiyosaki has been steering investors toward gold, silver and bitcoin for a while now if you keep up with his social media posts.\nHis rationale is that if the Fed keeps raising interest rates, the U.S. dollar strengthens, causing the price of gold, silver and bitcoin to sink, which makes it cheaper to invest in. Then when interest rates drop, he said those who invested in the bearer assets will reap the benefits.\nA Different Take\nRobert R. Johnson, PhD, CFA, CAIA, Professor of Finance, Heider College of Business, Creighton University, has a different take on whether people should invest in precious metals and bitcoin.\nBenefits of Adding Precious Metals to U.S. Equity Portfolios\nJohnson co-authored a paper titled, \u201cCan Precious Metals Make Your Portfolio Shine?\u201d in the \u201cJournal of Investing\u201d in 2009.\n\u201cDuring times of market turmoil one always hears talking heads espousing the benefits of investing in gold,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIn this paper we looked at the benefits of adding precious metals to U.S. equity portfolios and found the following:\n\u201cFirst, we found that adding a 25% allocation to the equities of precious metals firms (not the precious metals themselves) improves portfolio performance (that is, considering both return and volatility of returns).\n\u201cSecond we found that an indirect investment dominated a direct investment in precious metals. That is, the investment benefits are considerably larger if the exposure to precious metals is obtained indirectly via an investment in the equities of precious metals firms, rather than directly by purchasing the precious metal as a commodity (e.g., gold or silver bullion).\n\u201cThird, relative to platinum and silver, gold has better stand-alone performance and offers a better hedge against the negative effects of inflationary pressures.\n\u201cFourth, the benefits of precious metals are strongly tied to monetary conditions. During periods of Federal Reserve tightening (characterized by rising interest rates), the returns to precious metals commodities are significantly higher than they are during expansive Fed monetary policy periods. This result is in stark contrast to the U.S. equity market and the equities of precious metals companies (that languish when the Fed is tightening and prosper when the Fed pursues an expansive monetary policy. It should be noted that we found that neither direct or indirect investments in precious metals provide benefits of much consequence when the Fed is easing.\n\u201cFinally, while the benefits of precious metals to an investment portfolio varied somewhat over time, they prevailed throughout much of the 34-year period.\u201d\nJohnson\u2019s Thoughts on Investing in Precious Metals\nJohnson said he isn\u2019t an advocate of people investing in gold or other precious metals.\n\u201cSimply put, if one has a long time horizon \u2014 say, twenty or more years \u2014 one should not invest in gold or other precious metals as the long-term returns are far below those of equities,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of 1925, the price of an ounce of gold was $20.63. At the end of 2022, an ounce of gold sold for $1813.75. Over that 97-year period, the precious metal returned 4.72% compounded annually. Over that same time period, according to Ibbotson Associates, the compound annual rate of return of a diversified portfolio of large stocks (the S&P 500) was 10.1%. That same $20.63 invested in gold at the end of 1925 would have grown to $233,971 if invested in the S&P 500.\n\u201cInvesting in a diversified basket of small stocks provides even greater returns. The compound annual rate of return of a basket of small stocks over that 97-year period according to Ibbotson Associates was 11.8%. That same $20.63 would have grown to $1,011,943 at the end of 2022.\n\u201cThe overall return to gold was less than 1% of the return to a diversified basket of common stocks. While having a small position in precious metals may dampen portfolio volatility in the short run, the tradeoff between slightly dampened volatility and the lost long-term return is certainly not a prudent one, particularly for Gen Z/millennials with long investing time horizons.\n\u201cGold is a speculative investment, based on the Greater Fool Theory. The price of gold is not determined by its intrinsic value but simply by its expected selling price to someone in the future.\u201d\nJohnson\u2019s Opinion Regarding Bitcoin\nJohnson believes that you cannot truly invest in bitcoin. Instead, he said, you can only speculate.\n\u201cThe crypto market has never been a good place to invest,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAt times, it has been a profitable place for some to speculate. My belief is that \u2018Just Say No!\u2019 should guide your actions with respect to crypto. I can think of few worse strategies than committing investment to cryptocurrencies \u2026 There is no rational way to determine the value of bitcoin or any of the other various cryptocurrencies as one can\u2019t apply the tools of traditional finance to arrive at the intrinsic value (or true value) of the supposed asset.\u201d\nHe concluded, \u201cThere is no way to value cryptocurrencies other than the greater fool theory \u2014 the hope that some greater fool will pay you more than you paid. It is the consummate bubble, and investors should stay far away from cryptocurrencies, in general, and bitcoin specifically.\u201d",

Shoppers will also get greater protections for returning faulty or damaged items they buy.\nThe BNPL industry has boomed in popularity as consumers choose to split their purchases, rather than relying on more traditional credit cards. BNPL companies argue their products are often interest free, saving consumers money.\nThe government has launched a six-week consultation on its proposals, with plans to bring in a new law early next year that will be in force from 2026.\nProposals to regulate the BNPL sector have been repeatedly delayed, despite its rapid growth and concerns consumers could find themselves in mounting debt.\nTulip Siddiq, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said:\nMillions of people use buy-now, pay-later to manage their finances, but the previous government\u2019s dither and delay left them unprotected.\n04:27 PM BST\nECB might \u2018get on with\u2019 half point rate cuts\nEuropean rate-setters could supersize their rate cuts and deliver a half a percentage point cut in future, a euro zone economist has said.\nJack Allen-Reynolds, deputy chief euro zone economist at Capital Economics, said:\nIf activity indicators remain weak and domestic price pressures continue to ease, they might decide to get on with it and cut by 50bp [50 basis points, or half a percentage point]...\n04:22 PM BST\nWall Street shows \u2018schizophrenic behaviour\u2019 towards chip stocks\nWall Street remains positive this afternoon, with the S&P 500 up 0.1pc, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is up 0.3pc.\nTechnology shares, particularly chips, are providing much of the upside muscle today after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) beat earnings estimates and forecast a jump in fourth-quarter revenue, helping to ease fears of softening demand in the sector.\nChuck Carlson, chief executive at Horizon Investment Services in Indiana, said:\nYou have this schizophrenic behaviour toward chips this week.

Not yet. Are we in the process of breaking that neck? Yes,\u201d she said.\nAccording to Ms Lagarde, the information received by ECB rate-setters since their previous meeting was \u201call heading in the same direction: downwards\u201d.\nThe comments came after the ECB cut interest rates, upping the tempo at which it is lowering borrowing costs as inflation in the eurozone cools faster than expected and the economy loses steam.\nThe Frankfurt-based institution reduced rates by a quarter point, following a cut of the same size at its last meeting in September.\n03:33 PM BST\nGold hits fresh record amid falling inflation\nGold prices have hit record highs as central banks race to cut interest rates amid falling inflation.\nBullion climbed as much as 0.7pc to hit $2,691.79 an ounce, overtaking its last peak reached last month.\nThe precious metal is up 1.1pc this week as investors turn to the safe haven asset ahead of the US election.\nIts price is also surging higher in euros after the European Central Bank said the \u201cdisinflationary process is well on track\u201d as it cut interest rates for the third time this year.\nThanks for following the live updates so far today.

Advanced economies saw inflation rates at once-in-a generation highs.

shows the ECB has become concerned about a lack of growth in the eurozone economy.\nCarsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, said:\nThe decision to cut rates only five weeks after the last cut and with only very few pieces of economic data since then, suggests that the ECB must have become much more concerned about the eurozone\u2019s growth outlook and the risk of inflation undershooting the target.\nHe added: \u201cThe fact is that the ECB looks much more concerned about (the lack of) growth and inflation undershooting than five weeks ago and it\u2019s hard to see how today\u2019s rate cut cannot be seen as a signal that the ECB is now in a hurry to bring interest rates down to a more neutral level.\u201d\n01:31 PM BST\nECB to keep cutting interest rates amid economic downturn,

to keep cutting borrowing costs.\nIt said the \u201cdisinflationary process is well on track\u201d but warned that inflation \u201cis expected to rise in the coming months, before declining to target in the course of next year\u201d.\nIt said: \u201cIn particular, its interest rate decisions will be based on its assessment of the inflation outlook in light of the incoming economic and financial

very soon.\n\u201cWhile headline inflation should continue to fall this year as unfavourable base effects continue to unwind, we think the process will be slow and bumpy.\u201d\n12:41 PM BST\nWall

Earlier positive results from this campaign were highlighted in a news release \"Galiano Gold Provides Asanko Gold Mine 2023 Exploration Program Update\" (see press release dated October 25, 2023).\nThis program resulted in the discovery of a new high grade zone within the southern portion of Abore which was intersected in four drill holes over approximately 120 metres of strike length as shown in a series of cross sections in Figures 2 to 5 below. Intercepts in this zone are amongst the best ever intercepted at the AGM and include:\nHole ABPC23-224: 45 metres @ 12.4 g/t gold from 191m\nHole ABPC23-226: 37 metres @ 10.6 g/t gold from 199m\nHole ABPC23-239: 54 metres @ 3.3 g/t gold from 207m\nHole ABPC23-228: 41 metres @ 3.3 g/t gold from 191m\nThis new zone of mineralization is hosted primarily within the Abore granite and is characterized by significant hydrothermal alteration along with high density quartz veining, intense localized brecciation, disseminated arsenopyrite and visible gold. It remains open along strike in both directions and is untested at depth. A follow-up drill program is currently underway to test the extent of this zone.\nRobust mineralization was also intersected across the deposit as demonstrated by the following highlighted intercepts:\nHole ABPC23-246: 18 meters @ 8.2 g/t gold from 172m\nHole ABPC23-259: 24 meters @ 5.4 g/t gold from 263m\nHole ABPC23-223: 27 meters @ 4.2g/t gold from 246m\nHole ABPC23-228: 41 metres @ 3.3 g/t gold from 191m\nHole ABPC23-213: 20 meters @ 4.5 g/t gold from 166m\nHole ABPC23-241: 23 meters @ 3.8 g/t gold from 156m\nHole ABPC23-249: 19 meters @ 4.0 g/t gold from 273m\n\"These excellent results demonstrate that Abore has significant upside potential beyond the current Reserves,\" stated Chris Pettman, Galiano's Vice President of Exploration. \"Seeing significant intervals of high grade gold along the entire 1,600 metre strike length of the deposit, and the discovery of the new high grade south zone, gives us confidence that Abore will continue to grow and add considerable value to the AGM life of mine.\"\nMatt Badylak, Galiano's President and Chief Executive Officer added, \"The results of this program are expected to affect the size and geometry of the Abore Reserve pit. The impact this will have on Mineral Reserves and ore delivery in 2024 is currently being evaluated through pit optimization and redesign.

All three indexes hit record highs on Wednesday. [.N] The MSCI index for world stocks rose 1.3%.\nShares in electric car maker Tesla leapt 15% after Elon Musk, its billionaire CEO, emerged as one of Trump's key supporters in the final leg of his 2024 campaign.\nInvestors appeared to bet on Tesla's benefiting from Musk's ties with Trump, who has said he would create a government efficiency commission headed by Musk to cut federal spending.\nShares in Trump's social media company, Trump Media & Technology Group, gained 5.9% to $35.96 after surging as much as 42% overnight. The stock has approximately halved in value since hitting a record high in March.\nThe dollar index rallied 1.7% and was set for its best day since March 2020.\nOutside the United States, investors were decidedly less euphoric, weighed by concerns that higher tariffs under Trump would hurt global trade and economic growth.\nThe euro extended losses by a touch late in the day after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz sacked his finance minister, and said he will hold a parliamentary confidence vote in the government in January, triggering political chaos in Europe's largest economy.\nEuropean shares gave up earlier gains and fell 0.5%. Mexico's peso sank to its weakest level in over two years.\n\"The market is definitely moving in line with the Trump playbook; stocks and small caps, in particular, are higher on the idea that Trump will be good for U.S. companies,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist for Principal Asset Management in London.\n\"Across emerging markets, you can see China and Europe are struggling with the idea that they could face higher tariffs, and U.S. bond yields higher with expectations for a higher fiscal deficit and inflation.\"\nBONDS DISCONNECT\nU.S. borrowing costs surged particularly for longer-dated bonds, suggesting concern from investors about the U.S. deficit path.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield rallied 14 basis points to 4.4343%, its largest gain in a single day in nearly seven months.\nThe 30-year Treasury yield shot up 16 bps to 4.6085%, its biggest one-day increase since March 2020's pandemic-induced volatility. [US/]\nWhile markets were still confident the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates by 25 basis points at the close of its two-day meeting on Thursday, they slightly reduced bets on further easing in December.\n\"The big challenge for markets is that if you do see tariffs come through you need to balance the short-term nature of inflation risks with the medium-term aspect of lower growth,\" said Justin Onuekwusi, chief investment officer at investment firm St. James's Place. \"The market appears to be thinking about inflation right now.\"\nIn contrast, European government bonds rallied, and German two-year bond yields fell 11 basis points to 2.19%, while money markets priced in lower European Central Bank rates.\n\"For European businesses, Trump\u2019s return to the White House would mean considerable trade policy and geopolitical uncertainty, with negative implications for growth on the continent,\" said Berenberg chief economist Holger Schmieding.\nCURRENCY WINNERS AND LOSERS\nBitcoin emerged as one of the clear winners of the day.\nThe cryptocurrency climbed to a record high of $76,086 and was last up 9.6%. Trump is seen as more actively supportive of cryptocurrencies than the Democratic candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris.\nIn traditional currencies, the euro was hurt by potential tariffs and the widening differential between U.S. and European rates. It was last down 1.8% at $1.0730, set for its biggest daily fall since 2016's Brexit referendum and outpacing a 1.2% fall in sterling.\nThe dollar jumped 2% to 154.59 Japanese yen,, and gained 1.4% on the offshore yuan to 7.1969 yuan amid reports Chinese banks were selling dollars to slow the yuan's decline.\nChina is seen on the front line of tariff risk, and its currency in particular is trading on tenterhooks with implied volatility against the dollar around record highs.\nChinese stock markets have surged to almost one-month highs as investors expect a meeting of top policymakers in Beijing this week to approve local government debt refinancing and spending. Chinese blue chips lost early gains to turn flat, and Hong Kong stocks fell over 2%.\nMexico's peso briefly dropped as low as 20.8038 per dollar for the first time since August 2022, more than 3% below its previous close - the biggest such tumble since Mexico's election in the summer roiled domestic assets.\nUkraine's international sovereign bonds rallied nearly 2 cents, boosted by bets that a second Trump term could lead to a quicker end to Russia's war in Ukraine.\nThe sharp rise in the dollar pressured oil prices, and other commodities, as it makes them more expensive when buying in other currencies. [O/R]\nU.S. crude lost 0.2% to $71.83 per barrel, while Brent fell 0.6% to $75.11.\nGold prices dropped 3.1% to $2,660.22 an ounce, off a recent record peak of $2,790.15 [GOL/].\n(This story has been corrected to say yields rose, not sank, in paragraph 2)\n(Reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe in London; additional reporting by Wayne Cole in Sydney and Alun John in London; Editing by Angus MacSwan, Marguerita Choy and Leslie Adler)",

Harmony is South Africa's biggest gold producer by volume with production of 1.47 million ounces in fiscal 2023.\nThe company\u2019s mining operations are principally concentrated in South Africa. The company has nine underground operations located in the Witwatersrand Basin. Additionally, Harmony has an open-pit mine on the Kraaipan Greenstone Belt along with several surface sources treatment operations. The Hidden Valley, which is located in Papua New Guinea, is an open-pit silver and gold mine.\nAlso, many of these mines are located in the Free State Province such as Welcom, Virginia, Tshepong and Bambanani, along with the Evander gold mine in Mpumalanga province, the Elandskraal mine at the West Rand goldfields in Gauteng province, and Kalgold operations in the North West province.\nThe company has discontinued its mining operations at Mt. Magnet and South Kalgoorlie in Western Australia as a strategic move. Harmony recorded sales of $2,774 million for fiscal 2023 (ended Jun 30, 2023).\nExploration Projects\nDomestic Projects: In South Africa, Harmony operates a total of nine underground operations, one open pit operation and several surface operations including an open cast mine, and nine processing plants, which are located in all of the currently known goldfields in the Witwatersrand basin of South Africa as well as the Kraaipan Greenstone Belt.\nInternational Projects: In Papua New Guinea (PNG), Harmony has full ownership of Hidden Valley, an open-cast gold and silver project that began production in June 2009, and 50% ownership of the Wafi-Golpu project. Harmony\u2019s exploration portfolio focuses principally on highly prospective areas in PNG and the Wafi-Golpu project in particular. Harmony expects that if Wafi-Golpu is developed, it will shift the company\u2019s geographical mix from more than 90% South African production to 75% domestic output and 25% offshore. Harmony, in December 2022, also acquired the Eva Copper project and surrounding exploration tenements from Copper Mountain Mining Corporation.",

Newmont Corp's financial strength remains evident with $2.3 billion in consolidated cash and a declared dividend of $0.25 per share.\nStrengths\nGlobal Leadership and Production Scale: Newmont Corp (NYSE:NEM) stands as the world's largest gold miner, with a production forecast of approximately 6.9 million ounces of gold in 2024. The company's acquisition of Newcrest in November 2023 has further solidified its leadership position, enhancing its production capabilities and asset quality. With a portfolio that includes 17 wholly or majority-owned mines and interests in two joint ventures across the Americas, Africa, Australia, and Papua New Guinea, Newmont boasts a diverse and significant presence in the gold mining industry.\nFinancial Resilience: Despite market challenges, Newmont Corp (NYSE:NEM) has maintained a strong balance sheet, ending the first quarter of 2024 with $2.3 billion in consolidated cash and total liquidity of $6.7 billion. The company's financial strength is further underscored by its ability to declare a dividend of $0.25 per share in April 2024, demonstrating its commitment to shareholder returns even in a volatile market environment.\nWeaknesses\nCost Pressures and Asset Write-Downs: Newmont Corp (NYSE:NEM) has faced significant cost pressures, with costs applicable to sales rising from $1,482 million in 2023 to $2,106 million in 2024. Additionally, the company recorded a loss on assets held for sale of $485 million, reflecting the write-down of non-core assets as part of its portfolio optimization strategy. These factors have contributed to a reduction in net income, highlighting the need for Newmont to manage its cost structure more effectively.\nDependence on Commodity Prices: Newmont Corp's (NYSE:NEM) profitability is heavily influenced by fluctuations in gold prices, which can be volatile and unpredictable. The company's net income has been impacted by changes in the market price of gold, underscoring the inherent risk associated with its reliance on a single primary commodity for revenue generation.\nOpportunities\nStrategic Divestitures: Newmont Corp (NYSE:NEM) has announced its intent to divest six non-core assets, which is expected to streamline its operations and focus on its most profitable and strategic assets. This divestiture strategy presents an opportunity for Newmont to enhance its operational efficiency and allocate resources more effectively towards growth-oriented projects.\nCommitment to Sustainability: In April 2024, Newmont Corp (NYSE:NEM) published its Annual Sustainability Report, showcasing its commitment to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. The company's focus on sustainability not only aligns with global trends but also positions it favorably among investors and stakeholders who prioritize responsible mining practices.\nThreats\nCommodity Price Volatility: Newmont Corp (NYSE:NEM) is exposed to the risk of volatile gold prices, which can significantly affect its financial performance. The company's reliance on gold as its primary product means that any adverse price movements could have a material impact on its profitability and cash flow.\nGeopolitical and Regulatory Risks: Operating across multiple jurisdictions, Newmont Corp (NYSE:NEM) faces geopolitical risks that can disrupt its operations and affect its financial results. Changes in mining regulations, tax laws, and environmental policies in the countries where Newmont operates could pose additional challenges to the company's business model and strategic objectives.\nIn conclusion, Newmont Corp (NYSE:NEM) exhibits strong global leadership and financial resilience, which are key strengths in the competitive gold mining industry. However, the company must navigate cost pressures and commodity price volatility, which are significant weaknesses impacting its bottom line. Opportunities for strategic divestitures and a commitment to sustainability present avenues for growth and improved operational efficiency. Nevertheless, Newmont must remain vigilant against threats such as commodity price volatility and geopolitical risks that could undermine its financial stability and strategic plans.\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "full_text": "Happy Friday, traders. Welcome to our weekly market wrap, where we take a look back at these last five trading days with a focus on the market news, economic data, and headlines that had the most impact on gold prices and other key correlated assets\u2014 and may continue into the future.\nGold prices appear to be butting up against now-consolidating support at $2500/oz as the marketplace moves closer to the first FOMC rate cut since the Covid crisis.\nSo, what kind of week has it been?\nPlatitudes and cliches get used too often to oversimplify a description of gold trading (just as in other high-volume asset classes), but it really does feel direct and accurate to say that the gold market has found itself at a crossroads this week.\nOn the bearish side, traders and investors appear to be losing their appetite to bid aggressively on the yellow metal north of $2500/oz after the all-time highs of recent weeks. Whether due to a thinner volume of eager buyers at the moment because so much open interest came in during the run between $2400 and $2500 or because the market surmises that $2500, but not any higher, is the appropriate valuation for gold spot prices when the FOMC is expected to cut interest rates by -0.25% later this month, gold\u2019s chart held a relatively consistent level at or just below that key psychological line through the first half of the week (Tuesday and Wednesday, as most markets were closed on Monday for US and UK holidays.) The more optimistic note (though it falls short of being \u201cbullish\u201d) would be that even as the precious metal has dipped below $2500/oz more often this week than it has attempted to rally beyond it, support appears robust only as low as $2490.\nWe did see one strong, briefly sustained push in the other direction. Following the Thursday release of ADP\u2019s reporting on private payroll jobs added to the US labor market in August\u2014 which came in well below expectations (of +145K) and even below 100K, with downward revisions to prior months\u2014 markets had a strong reaction. The obvious line of thinking from traders and money managers was that this kind of tepid labor data not only cements the need for(and expectation) for the Fed to cut rates this month but increases the odds of a \u201cdouble\u201d cut of -0.50%. In the trading session that followed, gold prices rallied aggressively as the US Dollar continued to ebb, and prices for immediate delivery climbed back to $2515 and higher.\nCuriously, although Friday\u2019s non-farm payrolls number, as the crux of the last Jobs Report we\u2019ll see before the next FOMC meeting and decision, followed the same disappointing tune as the ADP data set, gold is having a decidedly inverse reaction. In the knee-jerk reaction to the NFP coming in at +142K (nearly -20K short of projections) and the prior month\u2019s value being revised to a somewhat shocking +89K, gold spot prices spiked towards $2550 for the briefest moment before reeling back lower. In the trading hours that followed, gold continued to fall (excluding a brief rebound as cash markets opened, which had little staying power.) This is despite Treasury yields, the Greenback continuing to weaken, and the major indexes of the US stock market running red in light of the disappointing August Jobs Report.",

James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, noted a daily average of up to 4,500 bitcoins are being taken out of circulation by spot bitcoin ETFs every day, compared to only 900 new coins being produced each day, owing to daily rewards caps.\nWhile these numbers may sound small in comparison to the estimated 19.6 million bitcoins in circulation, it is important to remember around 70% of bitcoins have not been traded in more than a year\u2014 according to cryptocurrency publication CoinDesk\u2014and spot bitcoin ETFs had claimed 4% of all bitcoins in circulation by the start of March, let alone those being regularly traded.\nThe impact of this is also far from purely anecdotal. In fact, the total supply of bitcoins on exchanges had declined 28% between 2020 and the end of February this year, a dynamic reflecting a \u201csevere demand shock\u201d, Butterfill said.\nAside from the direct demand conjured by the arrival of US spot ETFs, data from CryptoQuant revealed more than 90,700 bitcoins were withdrawn from major exchanges over the month through April 4, which cryptocurrency publication The Block warned was reducing the liquid supply of bitcoin as investors were taking their coins into cold storage as part of long-term holding strategies, in light of arrival of the new ETFs.\nStefan Wiederkehr, co-founder and managing director of IMP AG, told ETF Stream his firm has taken profits and \u201csignificantly\u201d reduced its bitcoin exposure.",

The filing of the NOI to prepare an EIS is a significant step forward towards becoming an operating mine. The reference document highlights an expected Record of Decision by the winter of 2025. The Spring Valley Mine Project is one of the largest gold development projects in the Americas and is a core value driver for Sailfish shareholders.\"\nPlan of Operations:\nThe PO covers 698 unpatented claims and 895 mill site claims as well as private fee lands, either owned or controlled by the Operator and proposes, among other things, the following activities and facilities:\nDevelopment of the Spring Valley open pit;\nConstruction of pit dewatering facilities, including rapid infiltration basins;\nDevelopment of three waste rock storage facilities;\nDevelopment of a heap leach facility;\nConstruction of a crushing circuit;\nConstruction of carbon processing and refining facilities;\nDevelopment of light duty and haul roads;\nDevelopment of stormwater control structures;\nDevelopment of other facilities including the mine fleet shop, explosives storage, truck shop, refueling area, and mine offices;\nDevelopment of site infrastructure including parking areas, yards, storage areas, and an aggregate plant; and\nDevelopment of site utilities including: power distribution, a used materials pad, freshwater distribution, potable water system, fire water system, sewage system, communications facilities, and fuel storage and distribution facilities.\nThe PO states that the proposed operation will use conventional open pit mining methods. The PO outlines the excavation of the open pit to occur over 13 years, which includes 18-24 months of pre-stripping during construction. Over the life of mine, approximately 323 million tons of mineralized material is expected to be mined, along with 598 million tons of waste rock and 328 million tons of alluvium. The average mining rate for Spring Valley is expected to be approximately 100 million tons of material per year.\nThe proposed operation would employ a contractor workforce of approximately 130 employees during the initial two-year construction period and approximately 250 full-time employees for the operations period. The proposed operation would operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. The total life of the Spring Valley Mine Project would be 29 years, including two years of construction, 11 years of mining, three additional years of ore processing, and 13 years of reclamation and closure activities.\nAs a reminder to shareholders, the Company's current royalty portfolio on the Spring Valley Mine Project covers 100% of the open pit as outlined in the PO, with the majority of the acres included in the proposed open pit covered by a 3% net smelter return royalty (\"NSR\") at prevailing gold prices.

Red Mountain offers a rare opportunity to access a large, under-explored mineral district. We are conducting a systematic exploration program, including diamond drilling, that we expect will provide a new perspective on the mineral potential of the Red Mountain district. Xanadu is entering an exciting period of new opportunities for discovery and growth.\u201d\nExploration Program Design\nFive thousand meters of drilling has been designed to test five shallow high-grade gold and copper-gold targets across the Red Mountain Lease (Figures 1 and 2). Drilling is targeting:\nShallow gold at Target 33,\nHigh-grade copper sulphide lodes at Target 10, and\nShallow porphyry targets at Nowie, Stockwork and Bavuu (Figure 3).\nFigure 1: Map of Mongolia, showing location of the Red Mountain Mining Lease.\nFigure 2: The Red Mountain Mining Lease with designed drill holes and target locations.\nFigure 3: Exploration drilling has commenced at Red Mountain.\nTarget 33 is a 1,000-metre-long and 100-wide-zone of alteration and anomalous gold mineralisation associated with an east west trending intrusion. Trenching and limited reverse circulation drilling in 2017 encountered significant widths of gold mineralisation (Figure 4).\nPrevious results1 include:\nOURC043\n40m @ 1.06g/t Au from 26m\nIncluding\n22m @ 1.82g/t Au from 40m\nIncluding\n10m @ 3.7g/t Au from 50m\nOURC055\n30m @ 0.68g/t Au from surface\nIncluding\n4m @ 2.82g/t Au from surface\nIncluding\n8m @ 0.39g/t Au from 4m\nAnd\n16m @ 1.13g/t Au from 42m\nIncluding\n8m @ 1.7g/t Au from 42m\nCurrent Drilling Program: Five shallow diamond drill holes have been planned to test a 300m strike across the center of the gold anomalism at Target 33. Follow-up drilling will be planned once interpretation of the initial results has been completed.\nFigure 4: Target 33 showing previous drilling and trenching2 and planned drilling 2024.\nTarget 10 \u2013 High-Grade Cu and Porphyry Cu-Au Target Target 10 was first identified in 2017 as a copper and gold in soil anomaly with a molybdenum halo and coincident bullseye magnetic feature. Two diamond drill holes were drilled into the magnetic feature, returning3:\nOUDDH089\n6.2m @ 4.24% Cu and 1.9g/t Au, from 128m\nIncluding\n0.9m @ 22.1%Cu and 8.27g/t Au, from 129m\nAnd\n79.5m @ 0.26% Cu and 0.21g/t Au, from 198.5m\nOUDDH090\n138m @ 0.27% Cu and 0.25g/t Au, from 200m\nCurrent Drilling Program: Three shallow drill holes and one deeper drill hole are planned to follow up on these results. Shallow holes are targeting around the high-grade copper intercept in OUDDH089 and are designed to determine the orientation of this zone, with the aim of delivering further expansion. A single deeper hole is planned to scissor the broad porphyry intercept in OUDDH090, testing the theory that this is associated with a south dipping structure, clearly visible in the magnetics (Figure 5)\nBavuu Porphyry was first identified in 2016 as a large-scale copper and gold soil anomaly. Trenching completed in 2016 returned very broad porphyry intercepts of copper and gold mineralisation5;\nOUCS030A\n188m @ 0.24% Cu and 0.18g/t Au\nIncluding\n52 m @ 0.36% Cu and 0.22g/t Au\nOUCS030B\n220m @ 0.15% Cu and 0.16g/t Au\nTwo shallow reverse circulation drill holes were drilled under OUCS030A with the deeper hole returning;\nOURC032\n168m @ 0.22% Cu and 0.25g/t Au from surface\nIncluding\n32m @ 0.31% Cu and 0.4g/t Au from 132m\nCurrent Drilling Program: Two diamond drill holes have been designed to test behind this intercept and along strike to the west (Figure 6).\nNo work has previously been conducted at Nowie by Xanadu. However, multiple drill hole collars and trenches from previous explorers are visible at surface. Soil sampling at Nowie has defined a 500m long copper in soil anomaly greater than 0.1% Cu and 0.25g/t Au. Geological mapping has identified strong oxide copper at surface associated with porphyry veining.\nCurrent Drilling Program: Three diamond drill holes have been designed to test beneath the 500m strike of surface mineralisation.\nStockwork Porphyry \u2013 Porphyry Cu-Au Target Limited work has previously been conducted at Stockwork by Xanadu. However, like the Nowie propsect, multiple drill hole collars and trenches from previous explorers are visible at surface. Soil sampling at Stockwork has defined a 650m long copper in soil anomaly greater than 0.05% Cu. Geological mapping has identified strong oxide copper at surface associated with intense porphyry veining and a reinterpretation based on this mapping has suggested an alternative orientation to drill test for the system at Stockwork.\nCurrent Drilling Program: Three shallow diamond drill holes have been designed to test this target.\nAbout Red Mountain The 100% owned Red Mountain project, located within the Dornogovi Province of southern Mongolia, approximately 420 kilometres southeast of Ulaanbaatar (Figures 1 and 2).\nThe project covers approximately 57 square kilometres in a frontier terrane with significant mineral endowment and has a granted 30-year mining licence. Red Mountain comprises a cluster of outcropping mineralising porphyry intrusions which display features typically found in the shallower parts of porphyry systems where narrow dykes and patchy mineralisation branch out above a mineralised stock. This underexplored porphyry district includes multiple porphyry copper-gold centres, mineralised tourmaline breccia pipes copper-gold/base metal skarns and high-grade epithermal gold veins.\nExisting porphyry mineralisation at Red Mountain is hosted within narrow stockwork zones that have been focused around several narrow structurally controlled monzonite porphyry dykes. Emplacement of mineralisation appears to be controlled by intersection of northeast and north-northwest trending structures. The quartz-chalcopyrite-bornite stockwork mineralisation is associated with strong reddening albite-sericite-biotite-magnetite (potassic) alteration assemblage in the host lithology. The thin nature of the mineralising dykes, their irregular intrusion geometry, and the patchy distribution of stockwork mineralisation are all features typically found in the shallower parts of porphyry systems, where narrow dykes and patchy mineralisation branch out above a mineralised stock. Similar orebody geometries are found in the shallower parts of the Northparkes porphyry copper-gold (Cu-Au) deposits in NSW, where porphyry mineralisation has also been tightly focused along a controlling structure adjacent to a felsic pluton. Like Northparkes, there is the potential for further mineralisation along the main structures at Diorite Hill and Stockwork Hill, and the likelihood that mineralisation extends (and could amalgamate) at depth.\nAbout Xanadu Mines Xanadu is an ASX and TSX listed Exploration company operating in Mongolia. We give investors exposure to globally significant, large-scale copper-gold discoveries and low-cost inventory growth.

Data provided by Xanadu. This Table 1 updates the JORC Table 1 disclosure dated 27 September 2022.7\n1.1 JORC TABLE 1 - SECTION 1 - SAMPLING TECHNIQUES AND DATA\nCriteria\nCommentary\nSampling techniques\nThe exploration results are based on diamond drill core samples, reverse circulation (RC) chip samples and channel samples from surface trenches.\nRepresentative \u00bd core samples were split from PQ, HQ & NQ diameter diamond drill core on site using rock saws, on a routine two metre sample interval that also honours lithological/intrusive contacts.\nThe orientation of the cut line is controlled using the core orientation line ensuring uniformity of core splitting wherever the core has been successfully oriented.\nSample intervals are defined and subsequently checked by geologists, and sample tags are attached (stapled) to the plastic core trays for every sample interval.\nRC chip samples are \u00bc splits from 1m intervals using a 75%:25% riffle splitter to obtain a 3kg sample.\nRC samples are uniform 2m samples formed from the combination of two \u00bc split 1m samples.\nTrench samples are collected as 2m composite from 30m above the trench toe.\nSampling generally honours lithological contacts.\nTrench samples are continuous along the length of the trench\nDrilling techniques\nThe exploration results are based upon diamond drilling of PQ, HQ and NQ diameters with both standard and triple tube core recovery configurations, RC drilling and surface trenching with channel sampling.\nAll drill core drilled by Xanadu has been oriented using the \u201cReflex Ace\u201d tool.\nDrill sample recovery\nDiamond drill core recoveries were assessed using the standard industry (best) practice which involves removing the core from core trays; reassembling multiple core runs in a v-rail; measuring core lengths with a tape measure, assessing recovery against core block depth measurements and recording any measured core loss for each core run.\nDiamond core recoveries average 97% through mineralisation.\nOverall, core quality is good, with minimal core loss. Where there is localised faulting and or fracturing core recoveries decrease, however, this is a very small percentage of the mineralised intersections.\nRC recoveries are measured using whole weight of each 1m intercept measured before splitting\nAnalysis of recovery results vs grade shows no significant trends that might indicate sampling bias introduced by variable recovery in fault/fracture zones.\nLogging\nAll drill core is geologically logged by well-trained geologists using a modified \u201cAnaconda-style\u201d logging system methodology. The Anaconda method of logging and mapping is specifically designed for porphyry Cu-Au mineral systems.\nLogging of lithology, alteration and mineralogy is intrinsically qualitative in nature. However, the logging is subsequently supported by 4 Acid ICP-MS (48 element) geochemistry and SWIR spectral mineralogy (facilitating semi-quantitative / calculated mineralogical, lithological and alteration classification) which is integrated with the logging to improve cross section interpretation and 3D geological model development.\nDrill core is also systematically logged for both geotechnical features and geological structures. Where drill core has been successfully oriented, the orientation of structures and geotechnical features are also routinely measured.\nBoth wet and dry core photos are taken after core has been logged and marked-up but before drill core has been cut.\nSub -sampling techniques and sample preparation\nAll drill core samples are \u00bd core splits from either PQ, HQ or NQ diameter cores. A routine 2m sample interval is used, but this is varied locally to honour lithological/intrusive contacts. The minimum allowed sample length is 30cm.\nCore is appropriately split (onsite) using diamond core saws with the cut line routinely located relative to the core orientation line (where present) to provide consistency of sample split selection.\nThe diamond saws are regularly flushed with water to minimize potential contamination.\nA field duplicate \u00bc core sample is collected every 30th sample to ensure the \u201crepresentivity of the in-situ material collected\u201d. The performance of these field duplicates is routinely analysed as part of Xanadu\u2019s sample QC process.\nRoutine sample preparation and analyses of DDH samples were carried out by ALS Mongolia LLC (ALS Mongolia), who operates an independent sample preparation and analytical laboratory in Ulaanbaatar.\nAll samples were prepared to meet standard quality control procedures as follows: Crushed to 75% passing 2mm, split to 1kg, pulverised to 85% passing 200 mesh (75 microns) and split to 150g sample pulp.\nALS Mongolia Geochemistry labs quality management system is certified to ISO 9001:2008.\nThe sample support (sub-sample mass and comminution) is appropriate for the grainsize and Cu-Au distribution of the porphyry Cu-Au mineralization and associated host rocks.\nTrench samples by previous explorers between 2001 to 2007 were prepared and assayed by SGS Mongolia.\nQuality of assay data and laboratory tests\nAll XAM samples were routinely assayed by ALS Mongolia for gold.\nAu is determined using a 25g fire assay fusion, cupelled to obtain a bead, and digested with Aqua Regia, followed by an atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) finish, with a lower detection limit (LDL) of 0.01 ppm.\nAll samples were also submitted to ALS Mongolia for the 48-element package ME-ICP61 using a four-acid digest (considered to be an effective total digest for the elements relevant to the MRE). Where copper is over-range (>1% Cu), it is analysed by a second analytical technique (Cu-OG62), which has a higher upper detection limit (UDL) of 5% copper.\nQuality assurance has been managed by insertion of appropriate Standards (1:30 samples - suitable Ore Research Pty Ltd certified standards), Blanks (1:30 samples), Duplicates (1:30 samples - \u00bc core duplicate) by Xanadu.\nAssay results outside the optimal range for methods were re-analysed by appropriate methods.\nOre Research Pty Ltd certified copper and gold standards have been implemented as a part of QC procedures, as well as coarse and pulp blanks, and certified matrix matched copper-gold standards.\nQC monitoring is an active and ongoing processes on batch-by-batch basis by which unacceptable results are re-assayed as soon as practicable.\nPrior to 2014: Cu, Ag, Pb, Zn, As and Mo were routinely determined using a three-acid-digestion of a 0.3g sub-sample followed by an AAS finish (AAS21R) at SGS Mongolia. Samples were digested with nitric, hydrochloric and perchloric acids to dryness before leaching with hydrochloric acid to dissolve soluble salts and made to 15ml volume with distilled water. The LDL for copper using this technique was 2ppm. Where copper was over-range (>1% Cu), it was analysed by a second analytical technique (AAS22S), which has a higher upper detection limit (UDL) of 5% copper. Gold analysis method was essentially unchanged.\nTrenching samples from 2001 to 2007 were analysed for 6 elements (Cu, Ag, Pb, Zn, As and Mo) by SGS Mongolia using a three-acid-digestion of a 0.3g sub-sample followed by an AAS finish (AAS21R). Samples were digested with nitric, hydrochloric and perchloric acids to dryness before leaching with hydrochloric acid to dissolve soluble salts and made to 15ml volume with distilled water. The LDL for copper using this technique was 2ppm. Where copper was over-range (>1% Cu), it was analysed by a second analytical technique (AAS22S), which has a higher upper detection limit (UDL) of 5% copper. Gold analysis method was essentially unchanged.\nVerification of sampling and assaying\nAll assay data QA/QC is checked prior to loading into Xanadu\u2019s Geobank data base.\nThe data is managed by Xanadu geologists.\nThe data base and geological interpretation is managed by Xanadu.\nCheck assays are submitted to an umpire lab (SGS Mongolia) for duplicate analysis.\nNo twinned drill holes exist.\nThere have been no adjustments to any of the assay data.\nLocation of data points\nDiamond drill holes have been surveyed with a differential global positioning system (DGPS) to within 10cm accuracy.\nThe grid system used for the project is UTM WGS-84 Zone 49N\nHistorically, Eastman Kodak and Flexit electronic multi-shot downhole survey tools have been used at Red Mountain to collect down hole azimuth and inclination information for the majority of the diamond drill holes. Single shots were typically taken every 30m to 50m during the drilling process, and a multi-shot survey with readings every 3-5m are conducted at the completion of the drill hole. As these tools rely on the earth\u2019s magnetic field to measure azimuth, there is some localised interference/inaccuracy introduced by the presence of magnetite in some parts of the Red Mountain mineral system. The extent of this interference cannot be quantified on a reading-by-reading basis.\nMore recently (since September 2017), a north-seeking gyro has been employed by the drilling crews on site (rented and operated by the drilling contractor), providing accurate downhole orientation measurements unaffected by magnetic effects. Xanadu have a permanent calibration station setup for the gyro tool, which is routinely calibrated every 2 weeks (calibration records are maintained and were sighted).\nThe project DTM is based on 1 m contours from satellite imagery with an accuracy of \u00b10.1 m.\nTrenching locations for trenches between 2001 and 2007 were located using a handheld GPS.\nData spacing and distribution\nHoles spacings range from <50m spacings within the core of mineralisation to +500m spacings for exploration drilling. Hole spacings can be determined using the sections and drill plans provided.\nHoles range from vertical to an inclination of -60 degrees depending on the attitude of the target and the drilling method.\nThe data spacing and distribution is sufficient to establish anomalism and targeting for porphyry Cu-Au, tourmaline breccia and epithermal target types.\nHoles have been drilled to a maximum of 1,300m vertical depth.\nThe data spacing and distribution is sufficient to establish geological and grade continuity.\nOrientation of data in relation to geological structure\nDrilling is conducted in a predominantly regular grid to allow unbiased interpretation and targeting.\nScissor drilling, as well as some vertical and oblique drilling, has been used in key mineralised zones to achieve unbiased sampling of interpreted structures and mineralised zones, and in particular to assist in constraining the geometry of the mineralised hydrothermal tourmaline-sulphide breccia domains.\nSample security\nSamples are delivered from the drill rig to the core shed twice daily and are never left unattended at the rig.\nSamples are dispatched from site in locked boxes transported on Xanadu company vehicles to ALS lab in Ulaanbaatar.\nSample shipment receipt is signed off at the Laboratory with additional email confirmation of receipt.\nSamples are then stored at the lab and returned to a locked storage site.\nAudits or reviews\nInternal audits of sampling techniques and data management are undertaken on a regular basis, to ensure industry best practice is employed at all times.\nExternal reviews and audits have been conducted by the following groups:\n2012: AMC Consultants Pty Ltd. was engaged to conduct an Independent Technical Report which reviewed drilling and sampling procedures. It was concluded that sampling and data record was to an appropriate standard.\n2013: Mining Associates Ltd. was engaged to conduct an Independent Technical Report to review drilling, sampling techniques and QA/QC. Methods were found to conform to international best practice.\n1.2 JORC TABLE 1 - SECTION 2 - REPORTING OF EXPLORATION RESULTS (Criteria in this section apply to all succeeding sections).\nCriteria\nCommentary\nMineral tenement and land tenure status\nThe Project comprises 1 Mining Licence (MV-17129A).\nXanadu now owns 90% of Vantage LLC, the 100% owner of the Oyut Ulaan mining licence.\nThe Mongolian Minerals Law (2006) and Mongolian Land Law (2002) govern exploration, mining and land use rights for the project.\nExploration done by other parties\nPrevious exploration was conducted by Quincunx Ltd, Ivanhoe Mines Ltd and Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd including extensive drilling, surface geochemistry, geophysics, mapping.\nGeology\nThe mineralisation is characterised as porphyry copper-gold type.\nPorphyry copper-gold deposits are formed from magmatic hydrothermal fluids typically associated with felsic intrusive stocks that have deposited metals as sulphides both within the intrusive and the intruded host rocks. Quartz stockwork veining is typically associated with sulphides occurring both within the quartz veinlets and disseminated thought out the wall rock. Porphyry deposits are typically large tonnage deposits ranging from low to high grade and are generally mined by large scale open pit or underground bulk mining methods. The deposits at Red Mountain are atypical in that they are associated with intermediate intrusions of diorite to quartz diorite composition; however, the deposits are in terms of contained gold significant, and similar gold-rich porphyry deposits.\nDrill hole Information\nDiamond drill holes are the principal source of geological and grade data for the Project.\nSee figures in this ASX/TSX Announcement.\nData Aggregation methods\nA nominal cut-off of 0.1% CuEq is used in copper dominant systems for identification of potentially significant intercepts for reporting purposes. Higher grade cut-offs are 0.3%, 0.6% and 1% CuEq.\nA nominal cut-off of 0.1g/t AuEq is used in gold dominant systems like for identification of potentially significant intercepts for reporting purposes. Higher grade cut-offs are 0.3g/t, 0.6g/t and 1g/t AuEq.\nMaximum contiguous dilution within each intercept is 9m for 0.1%, 0.3%, 0.6% and 1% CuEq.\nMost of the reported intercepts are shown in sufficient detail, including maxima and subintervals, to allow the reader to make an assessment of the balance of high and low grades in the intercept.\nInforming samples have been composited to two metre lengths honouring the geological domains and adjusted where necessary to ensure that no residual sample lengths have been excluded (best fit).\nThe copper equivalent (CuEq) calculation represents the total metal value for each metal, multiplied by the conversion factor, summed and expressed in equivalent copper percentage with a metallurgical recovery factor applied.\nCopper equivalent (CuEq or eCu) grade values were calculated using the following formula:\nCuEq = Cu + Au * 0.62097 * 0.8235,\nGold Equivalent (AuEq or eAu) grade values were calculated using the following formula:\nAuEq = Au + Cu / 0.62097 * 0.8235\nWhere: Cu = copper grade (%); Au = gold grade (g/t); 0.62097 = conversion factor (gold to copper); 0.8235 = relative recovery of gold to copper (82.35%)\nThe copper equivalent formula was based on the following parameters (prices are in USD):\nCopper price = 3.1 $/lb (or 6834 $/t)\nGold price = 1320 $/oz\nCopper recovery = 85%\nGold recovery = 70%\nRelative recovery of gold to copper = 70% / 85% = 82.35%.\nRelationship between mineralisation on widths and intercept lengths\nMineralised structures are variable in orientation, and therefore drill orientations have been adjusted from place to place in order to allow intersection angles as close as possible to true widths.\nExploration results have been reported as an interval with 'from' and 'to' stated in tables of significant economic intercepts. Tables clearly indicate that true widths will generally be narrower than those reported.\nDiagrams\nSee figures in this ASX/TSX Announcement.\nBalanced Reporting\nExploration results have been reported at a range of cut-off grades, above a minimum suitable for open pit mining, and above a minimum suitable for underground mining.\nOther substantive exploration data\nExtensive work in this area has been done and is reported separately.\nFurther Work\nThe mineralisation is open at depth and along strike.\nCurrent estimates are restricted to those expected to be reasonable for open pit mining. Limited drilling below this depth (-300m RL) shows widths and grades potentially suitable for underground extraction.\nExploration ongoing.\n1.3 JORC TABLE 1 - SECTION 3 ESTIMATION AND REPORTING OF MINERAL RESOURCES\nMineral Resources are not reported so this is not applicable to this report.\n1.4 JORC TABLE 1 - SECTION 4 ESTIMATION AND REPORTING OF ORE RESERVES\nOre Reserves are not reported so this is not applicable to this report.\n1 ASX Announcement \u2013 Oyut Ulaan Exploration Update, 28th June 2017, ASX Announcement \u2013 XAM Quarterly Report Q2 2017 Final 2 ASX Announcement \u2013 Oyut Ulaan Exploration Update, 28th June 2017, ASX Announcement \u2013 XAM Quarterly Report Q2 2017 Final 3 ASX Announcement \u2013 Oyut Ulaan Exploration Update \u2013 High Grade Massive Sulphide Mineralisation Intersected, 19 July 2017 4 ASX Announcement \u2013 Oyut Ulaan Exploration Update \u2013 High Grade Massive Sulphide Mineralisation Intersected, 19 July 2017 5 XAM Quarterly Activities Report, Quarter Ending 31 December 2016 and XAM Quarterly Activities Report, Quarter Ending 31 March 2017 6 XAM Quarterly Activities Report, Quarter Ending 31 December 2016 and XAM Quarterly Activities Report, Quarter Ending 31 March 2017 7 ASX/TSX Announcement 27 September 2022 \u2013 Broad, shallow gold zone at Red Mountain",

Even without the benefit of an income stream (the main driver of total returns from most investments), gold has given investors a 54pc profit since September 2022.\nGold is a volatile asset and can require extreme patience at times.\nIf you had bought an ounce of the precious metal in September 2011 at the height of Europe\u2019s sovereign debt crisis, you would have paid around $1,800 (\u00a31,360). You would have had to wait until the summer of 2020, when there was still no end in sight to the pandemic, before that investment was briefly back above water. Two years ago, you would still have been in negative territory.\nGold does nothing for years, and then suddenly it takes off.\nIf you are prepared to hold for the long term, gold can be a great store of value. But you might need to torture the data to get the answer you need.\nIf you had invested in gold during the final months of the dotcom bubble 25 years ago (not long after Gordon Brown sold the UK\u2019s reserves at the bottom of the market), you would have made 10 times your money. That\u2019s one and a half times better than the total return from US shares and three times better than what the FTSE 100 has delivered on the same basis.\nIf you had bought 30 years ago, however, gold would have trailed the equity markets on both sides of the Atlantic.\nThat is the context in which investors should view the current enthusiasm for gold. There is a long list of reasons that gold is rising at the moment, and it may continue to do so, but surges in the gold price are usually followed by long periods of drift.\nSo why have investors been so keen on gold?\nFirst, the obvious \u2013 supply and demand. There are some big buyers out there, most obviously central banks looking to diversify their reserves away from the US dollar at a time of economic fragmentation and rising geopolitical tensions.\nGoldman Sachs estimates that reported and unreported central bank purchases have been running at nearly three times the post-2010 average in the last two years. Other sources of higher demand include new industrial uses in electronics and renewable energy. It\u2019s no longer just about investment and jewellery.\nAs with other commodities, like copper, cranking up supply to meet that higher demand is a slow burn. Mining output has been stable in recent years and with limited new supply hitting the market, the path of least resistance for the gold price is up.\nThe second tailwind for gold is the interplay between inflation and interest rates. The precious metal finds itself in a sweet spot today between modestly falling but still sticky inflation and easing monetary policy.\nGold is viewed as a hedge against inflation and, while price rises are moderating, core inflation remains persistently above central banks\u2019 targets. At the same time, falling interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding an asset that pays no income. With interest rates at 5pc, you are giving up quite a lot to hold gold in your portfolio. Less so at 3pc.\nThe third reason gold is rising in value is that, for right or wrong, people trust it. President Herbert Hoover said: \u201cWe have gold because we cannot trust governments.\u201d John Pierpont Morgan\u2019s riff on the same theme was: \u201cGold is money. Everything else is credit.\u201d\nGold has no counterparty risk. The value of shares is tied to the performance of a company; bonds are only as good as the business or government that issues them. Gold is a bitcoin you can put in your pocket. It\u2019s accepted globally and it\u2019s liquid. You will always find a buyer for your gold when you need one.\nThe final reason gold is going up is that it is going up. For years on end no-one mentions the precious metal in polite company. Then, like London buses, articles making the case for gold hunt in packs.\nThe problem with buying an asset like gold when momentum is on your side is that when the pendulum swings back the other way there is little of substance to support the price. A share or bond will find a floor when its yield moves too far away from the return available on comparable investments like cash or property. But there\u2019s nothing to say that gold is underpriced at $1,000 an ounce or over-priced at $3,000. The price is just what it is.\nSo, I\u2019m a sceptical bull. I do have some exposure to gold myself, and I\u2019m glad I have over the past couple of years. But if someone were to ask me today whether they should too, I would struggle to answer them.\nTom Stevenson is an investment director at Fidelity International. The views are his own",

Since the start of 2023, this digital asset has soared 311%, thanks recently to the approval and launch of spot exchange-traded funds.\nIt's interesting to note that gold has also been experiencing bullish sentiment. Its price is in record territory as well. But when comparing these two assets, it's strikingly obvious that the top cryptocurrency has a huge edge over the precious metal. Let's take a closer look at Bitcoin and gold.\nSome similarities\nI think it's first appropriate to understand how Bitcoin and gold might be similar. After all, there's a reason many investors find it smart to compare these two.\nBitcoin and gold possess certain levels of scarcity. At some point in the future, there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin tokens in circulation. And there's only a certain amount of gold in the Earth's crust.\nBasic economic principles show us that if something has a fixed supply and demand rises, the price should go up. The simple rule helps explain why gold has typically been viewed as a safe asset to hold over long periods.\nBesides being used as a store value, these two assets have some utility. Gold is primarily used in jewelry because of its luster and rarity. But it has tiny value as an input in industrial use cases.\nBecause of its decentralized and global nature, coupled with the fact that no single entity controls it, Bitcoin is useful when sending large amounts of money to anyone directly. The final and nearly immediate settlement is also compelling.\nNotable differences\nBitcoin and gold have some surface level similarities, but by digging deeper, we'll see that they are very different. Bitcoin has numerous properties that make it superior to gold.\nScarcity is a topic that we should revisit. The supply of gold might seem fixed, but it's not. Of all the gold that has ever been known to be in the Earth's crust, about 77% has been mined, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. There is still a massive amount underground. If gold's price were to skyrocket tomorrow, then it becomes economically feasible for mining companies to invest aggressively in bolstering their ability to extract more deposits.\nBasically, the supply of gold can be adjusted if the demand is strong enough. And there's also the possibility that gold deposits will be found in outer space.\nThis topic of scarcity is where Bitcoin truly shines. Bitcoin is absolutely finite. There can never be more than 21 million coins in circulation, as this is written in the software. Unless the majority of nodes agree to increase the supply, this isn't going to change. Supply can't be adjusted to match demand trends, which is why Bitcoin has historically been extremely volatile.",

(TSXV: GXS) (OTCQX: GXSFF) (FWB: G5MA) (\"Goldsource\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce results for a Preliminary Economic Assessment (\"PEA\") for the Company's 100%-owned Eagle Mountain Gold Project (the \"Project\") in Guyana, South America. The PEA demonstrates potential for robust project economics as expressed by both strong after-tax returns on capital and free cash flow.\nThe PEA was prepared by ERM Consultants Canada Ltd. (\"ERM\") with contributions from Soutex Inc. (\"Soutex\") for aspects related to metallurgy and the process plant in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\"). The PEA contemplates a fit-for-purpose, low capital cost (\"capex\") intensity phased development plan for the Project. The initial phase (Phase 1) comprises shallow (starting at surface), low strip ratio open pits targeting soft-rock saprolite resources and a processing plant design that accounts for the beneficial characteristics of saprolite. This is followed by the second phase (Phase 2), the development of open pit fresh rock resources, in which gold production is derived from a blend of fresh rock, transition rock and saprolite material.\nPEA Highlights (refer to Tables 1, 2, 3)\n-\nRobust project economics with strong after-tax IRR and after-tax NPV.\n-\nAfter-tax internal rate of return (\"IRR\") of 57% and after-tax net present value discounted at 5% (\"NPV5%\") of US$292 million (\"M\") at the base-case gold price of US$1,850 per ounce (\"oz\").\n-\nAfter-tax IRR of 69% and after-tax NPV5% of US$388M at spot gold prices of US$2,055 per oz (January 15, 2024).\n-\n-\nShallow open pit with 15-year mine life; quick payback period driven by a phased development plan.\n-\nPhase 1 - 4.5 years of production from low strip soft-rock saprolite resources offers low capex intensity, with development capex estimated at US$95.6M, and a short payback period of 18 months.\n-\nPhase 2 - the subsequent development of shallow and higher-grade fresh rock resources brings the mine life to 15 years. Phase 2 development capex estimated at US$46.6M consists primarily of additional processing equipment, building off the substantial infrastructure provided in Phase 1.\n-\nAverage all-in sustaining costs (\"AISC\") of US$1,077 per oz of gold produced. Phase 1 AISC estimated at US$829 per oz of gold.\n-\nProjected average annual gold production of 66,500 oz per year for 15 years.\n-\nAverage mill head grade of 1.26 grams per tonne (\"gpt\") gold with associated strip ratio of 2.1, and average mill gold recovery of 90.7%. Phase 1 mill head grade of 1.20 gpt gold with associated strip ratio of 1.2, and mill recovery of 95.1%.\n-\nGoldsource Chief Executive Officer, Steve Parsons, P.Eng., stated, \"The PEA results for Eagle Mountain represent a significant milestone in demonstrating the potential for robust project economics as expressed by the strong after-tax IRR of 57% and quick payback period. Also, a key objective with the PEA was to demonstrate the merits of the phased development plan, specifically the potential to scale into production with a low capex intensity, multi-year runway of low all-in sustaining costs, and potential strong free cash flow generation. As expected, the Eagle Mountain Gold Project is well suited to this approach owing to the distinctly shallow nature of the mineral resources. Notably, the soft-rock saprolite, which does not require drilling and blasting, translates to low estimated initial capital and operating cost intensities.\"\n\"The PEA incorporates a fit-for-purpose approach; mine design and equipment selection are tailored for the distinct requirements of Phase 1 and Phase 2. The PEA contemplates a technically simple, open pit mine and 5,000 tpd gold processing plant. The plant is initially configured for saprolite, which brings to bear lower power requirements and elevated gold recoveries. In Year 5, the plant is upgraded with conventional crushing and grinding equipment to treat a blend of fresh rock, transition rock and saprolite. While throughput rates greater than 5,000 tpd and lower cut-off grades for the fresh rock component could have allowed for production and NPV benefits, this would have come at the expense of IRR and with larger financing needs, concessions we were not willing to make as we look to bring forward a project with a low capital intensity and more favourable development logistics.\"\nKey PEA Assumptions\n-\nThe PEA is based on the April 2022 Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") comprised of an estimated 31.1 million tonnes (\"Mt\") grading 1.18 gpt gold for 1,183,000 oz of gold in indicated mineral resources, and 18.4 Mt grading 0.98 gpt gold for 582,000 oz of gold in inferred mineral resources. The 2022 MRE is contained in a technical report titled \"Eagle Mountain Gold Project, Potaro - Siparuni Region Guyana, NI 43-101 Technical Report\" dated May 24, 2022, with an effective date of April 5, 2022.\n-\nThe production scale for Phase 2 was established to maximize the utility of the 5,000 tonne per day (\"tpd\") Phase 1 processing infrastructure (i.e. minimize the requirements for additional capex). The timing of the transition to Phase 2 was set based on projections for free cash flow, specifically to recover the Phase 1 development capex and generate significant surplus cash to fund Phase 2.\n-\nPEA mine plan and cost assumptions contemplate contract mining and power generation.\n-\nPhase 1 and Phase 2 development capex estimates for the processing plant are based on budget quotes from manufacturers for large mechanical equipment and quotes from recently constructed and under-construction projects for other plant/auxiliary equipment. Non-plant and other development capex are derived from both benchmarking analyses using comparable projects and calculation-derived estimates for certain earthmoving activities. Development capex includes a contingency of 15%.\nA technical report prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 on the Project which includes the PEA will be filed with the applicable Canadian securities regulators within 45 days of this news release. The technical report will be available under the Company's profile on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca) and on the Company's website (www.goldsourcemines.com). The results of the PEA are preliminary in nature and include inferred mineral resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them to be classified as mineral reserves. There is no certainty that the results of the PEA will be realized. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.\nLife of Mine (\"LOM\") Estimated Cash Flow Profile\nThe economic analysis of the Project is based on the production and cost models developed for the Phase 1, Phase 2, and LOM construction, operating, and reclamation plans. The models include detail for the major components of the phases, including the open pits, carbon-in-leach (\"CIL\") processing plant, and supporting infrastructure, such as haul roads, waste rock dumps and tailings storage facilities. The economic analysis uses a cash flow model at a base-case gold price of US$1,850 per oz. The model applies all Phase 1 pre-production capital costs (development capex) in year 0 and Phase 2 development capex in years 4 and 5. At the base-case gold price of US$1,850 per oz gold, cumulative undiscounted after-tax free cash flow is estimated at US$443M (Figure 1) and average annual after-tax free cash flow at US$37M for years 1 to 15. At spot gold prices of US$2,055 per oz (January 15, 2024), cumulative undiscounted after-tax free cash flow is estimated at US$585M and average annual after-tax free cash flow at US$47M.\nTable 1: Economic Analysis Summary (Base Case and Spot Gold Price Assumptions)\n| | Units | US$1,850/oz (Base Case) | US$2,055/oz (spot)(1) | ||\n| | | Pre-Tax | After-Tax | Pre-Tax | After-Tax |\n| IRR (3) | % | 75% | 57% | 91% | 69% |\n| Payback Period(2) | Months | 16 | 18 | 14 | 16 |\n| NPV0% (3) | US$ M | 605 | 443 | 793 | 585 |\n| NPV5% (3) | US$ M | 406 | 292 | 532 | 388 |\n| NPV8%(3) | US$ M | 326 | 232 | 428 | 309 |\n|\n| |||||\n| Notes: | |||||\n| (1) Spot gold prices on January 15, 2024. | |||||\n| (2) Payback period for Phase 1 development capex. | |||||\n| (3) After-tax NPV and IRR estimates exclude existing in-country tax loss pools totaling C$37M, which can be applied against taxes payable.

Refer to note at end of this news release.\nOverview of Production Plan\nThe conceptual LOM plan estimates total gold production of 997,000 oz, of which 306,000 oz at AISC of US$829 per oz of gold are for Phase 1 (Figure 2). Total recoverable gold is a subset of the 2022 MRE, as shown in Table 4, largely due to the Company's express focus on delivering a smaller, higher-grade \"fit-for-purpose\" project to enhance the overall development logistics in the context of the project particulars and market backdrop. The alternative, a larger bulk tonnage operation with a lower cut-off grade, notably for the fresh rock, could have resulted in higher conversion rates, but would have come with higher development capex and lower internal rates of return.\nThe PEA contemplates an open pit operation using contract mining. Mill feed for the processing plant is sourced from the primary Eagle Mountain deposit as well as satellite pits at the Salbora deposit and Toucan and Powis prospects, which are proximal (within approximately 1.5 kilometres) to the Eagle Mountain pit outline. Mining will use traditional load and haul methods using hydraulic excavators, and/or wheel loaders as appropriate to the terrain. Based on the conceptual locations of the processing plant and waste dumps, haulage is predominantly downhill from the Eagle Mountain deposit, which provides scope for fuel savings. Phase 1, estimated at 4.5 years, considers initial gold production from saprolite mineralization during which time most of the mining will be \"free dig\" (i.e. not requiring blasting). This is followed by Phase 2 in which gold production will be derived from a blend of fresh rock, transition and saprolite mineralization for an estimated 10.5 years, bringing the estimated LOM plan to 15 years. Phase 2 will require drilling and blasting of the fresh and transition rock to facilitate mining, material handling and processing. The PEA mine plan is designed to maintain mill feed rates at 1.825 Mt per year (approximately 5,000 tpd) through Phases 1 and 2.\nFigure 2: PEA Annual Production and Operating Cost Profiles\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/4977/194325_93451bcfc4f8c982_003full.jpg\nFigure 3: Annual Saprolite, Fresh Rock/Trans Tonnes Moved With Corresponding Strip Ratio\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/4977/194325_93451bcfc4f8c982_004full.jpg\nFor Phase 1, the process flowsheet involves a low capital intensity saprolite CIL plant. Main components include five leach tanks, scrubber, ball mill, cyclones, gravity concentrators, carbon stripping circuit, and effluent treatment. While the back end of the plant, downstream of the grinding circuit, is similar for both phases, additional screening, crushing and grinding, and additional power generation equipment are required for Phase 2 to treat the harder fresh rock material. The mill configuration for Phase 2 is also capable of processing 5,000 tpd, including up to 4,250 tpd of fresh and/or transition rock with the balance of the mill feed being made up with saprolite. The saprolite and fresh rock/transition composition of run-of-mine material is presented in Figure 3. Coarse and bulk fresh rock encountered in Phase 1 will be stockpiled and processed in Phase 2. Detailed metallurgical testwork from 2018 (saprolite) and 2022 (fresh rock and saprolite) for areas represented in the 2022 MRE provide the basis for the PEA mill design criteria developed by Soutex.\nTable 4: PEA Mine Plan (Higher-Grade Subset of the 2022 MRE)\n| Classification | April 2022 MRE | 2024 PEA Conceptual LOM Plan | Net Conversion of Tonnes | ||\n| Mt | In-situ grade | Mt | Mill head grades (gpt Au) | ||\n| Indicated | | | | | |\n| Saprolite and Trans | 12.5 | 1.04 | 11.3 | 1.08 | 90% |\n| Fresh Rock | 18.7 | 1.28 | 8.7 | 1.58 | 47% |\n| All Indicated | 31.1 | 1.18 | 20.0 | 1.30 | 64% |\n| Inferred | | | | | |\n| Saprolite and Trans | 6.1 | 0.71 | 3.1 | 0.92 | 51% |\n| Fresh Rock | 12.3 | 1.12 | 4.1 | 1.32 | 33% |\n| All Inferred | 18.4 | 0.98 | 7.2 | 1.15 | 39% |\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\nNotes:\n(1) Numbers have been rounded to reflect the precision of a MRE and PEA Conceptual Plan.

The April 2022 MRE had grouped the transition material with the saprolite resources.\n(4) For the April 2022 MRE notes, refer to Table 8 in this news release and to report titled \"Eagle Mountain Gold Project, Potaro - Siparuni Region Guyana, NI 43-101 Technical Report\" dated May 24, 2022, with an effective date of April 5, 2022.\nCapital and Operating Cost Estimates\nPhase 1 development capex (preproduction capex) is estimated at US$95.6M (including contingency), of which US$56.5M is related to the processing plant (direct and indirects). Phase 2 development capex, primarily comprised of processing equipment to accommodate harder fresh rock, is estimated at US$46.6M with expenditures to commence in the second half of year 4. A further US$133.4M of sustaining capex is estimated over the LOM (averaging US$8.9M per year), of which US$51.9M relates to tailings storage facilities, US$23.8M to the processing plant, and US$20M to open pit auxiliary equipment. Total LOM capital expenditures are estimated to be US$295.6M. This includes US$20M for mine reclamation at the end of the LOM. Tables 5 and 6 provide the breakdown of the capital cost estimates.\nTable 5: PEA Development and Sustaining Capex Summary\n| CAPEX Description | Year | Cost (US$ M) |\n| Development Capex (1) | | |\n| Phase 1 - Direct Costs | 0 | 65.0 |\n| Phase 1 - Indirect, Owners Cost, Contingency | 0 | 30.5 |\n| Phase 1 - Sub-Total | | 95.6 |\n| Phase 2 - Direct Costs | 4 & 5 | 32.3 |\n| Phase 2 - Indirect, Owners Cost, Contingency | 4 & 5 | 14.3 |\n| Phase 2 - Sub-Total | | 46.6 |\n| Sustaining Capex(1) and Other | | |\n| Sustaining Costs | 2-15 | 133.4 |\n| Reclamation | 15+ | 20.0 |\n| Total LOM CAPEX | | 295.6 |\n|\n| ||\n| Notes: | ||\n| (1) Non-IFRS financial performance measures with no standardized definition under IFRS.

Refer to note at end of this news release. |\nTotal LOM operating costs are estimated at US$786M. The operating cost estimate is based on the total amount of labour, materials, and consumables that will be required to fully execute the mining and processing plans for Phase 1 and 2. The PEA contemplates open pit mining and power generation by contractors. Average unit mining cost of US$2.10 and US$2.75 per tonne mined were used for saprolite and fresh rock/transition, respectively, in the economic analysis. Operating costs have been determined based on benchmarking analyses using similar sized saprolite and fresh rock operations with adjustments for local conditions. For unit processing cost determinations, the average ore blend (ratio of fresh rock to saprolite) for the LOM was used to estimate power draw and reagent consumptions. Table 7 provides a breakdown of the operating cost estimates.\nAs contemplated in the PEA study, over 300 mining, processing, maintenance, and general administrative workers are expected to be employed directly. In addition, the Project will benefit Guyana through both taxation and royalty payments.\nTable 7: PEA Operating Cost Summary\n| Description | Total | Unit Cost | |\n| (US$ M) | (US$/t) | (US$/oz produced) | |\n| Mining (1)(2) | 201.5 | 2.40/t mined | 202 |\n| 7.40 | |||\n| Processing (1)(2) | 448.5 | 16.33 | 450 |\n| Rehandle | 3.5 | 0.13 | 4 |\n| G&A | 122.5 | 4.50 | 123 |\n| Other | 7.5 | 0.55 | 8 |\n| Rent | 0.8 | 0.03 | 1 |\n| Contractor Mobilization | 2.0 | 0.07 | 2 |\n| Total Operating Costs | 786.4 | 28.88 | 789 |\n| Treatment & Refining Charges | 7.8 | 0.28 | 8 |\n| Royalties | 146.7 | 5.39 | 147 |\n| Total Cash Costs(5) | 940.8 | 34.55 | 943 |\n| Sustaining Capex (3)(5) | 133.4 | 5.08 | 134 |\n| All-In Sustaining Cost (AISC) (4)(5) | 1,074.2 | 39.64 | 1,077 |\nNotes:\n(1) The unit mining and processing costs for saprolite are estimated at US$2.10/tonne mined and US$11.10/tonne milled, respectively.\n(2) The unit mining and processing costs for fresh and transition rock are estimated at US$2.75/tonne mined and US$21.00/tonne milled, respectively.\n(3) Sustaining capital costs excludes closure costs.\n(4) Site-level AISC include total cash costs and sustaining capital costs.\n(5) Non-IFRS financial performance measures with no standardized definition under IFRS. Refer to note at end of this news release.\nEagle Mountain Project Opportunities\nBased on Project work, including engineering studies, exploration, and results of a 2017 pilot plant operation at Eagle Mountain, opportunities have been identified which may offer scope to enhance Project economics. The following opportunities will be evaluated:\n-\nThe PEA economic model accounts for US$59M of construction costs over the LOM for a tailings storage facility. It is recommended that the Company evaluate alternative and potentially lower cost locations for tailings deposition with consideration given to valley and topographic lows within the Eagle Mountain Prospecting License. Also, the opportunity to backfill the open pits during Phase 2 activities will be evaluated.\n-\nEvaluation of the potential efficacy of locating a portion of the saprolite processing equipment, such as the scrubber, and pump boxes, at higher elevations along the northeast flanks of the Eagle Mountain deposit. This could allow for the use of slurry transport of saprolite material to the main processing facility, reducing truck haulage of saprolite from these areas of the Eagle Mountain deposit. This technique was tested during the 2017 gravity pilot plant. Trade-off studies are recommended.\n-\nThe PEA contemplates a power-by-the-hour contract using diesel generators. The Company will complete trade-off studies to evaluate the merits of owner-operated gensets. Also, the Company will evaluate opportunities for lower costs via hydrokinetic power sourced from nearby rivers.\n-\nThe PEA does not include drill results after December 2021, the cut-off date for the 2022 MRE. The Company will evaluate opportunities to incorporate exploration targets that have been identified, upgrade inferred mineral resources to indicated mineral resources and via expansion drilling test for opportunities to capture additional shallow gold mineralization currently below the US$1,600 per oz PEA pit shells. Also, several area and regional targets need to be evaluated for potential additional mineral resources.\n2022 Mineral Resource Estimate for Eagle Mountain Project\nTable 8: Summary of April 2022 MRE\n| Classification | April 2022 MRE Update | ||\n| Tonnes (000 t) | Gold (gpt) | Ounces Au (oz) | |\n| Indicated | | | |\n| Saprolite & Transition | 12,500 | 1.04 | 417,000 |\n| Fresh rock | 18,700 | 1.28 | 766,000 |\n| Total | 31,100 | 1.18 | 1,183,000 |\n| Inferred | | | |\n| Saprolite & Transition | 6,100 | 0.71 | 139,000 |\n| Fresh rock | 12,300 | 1.12 | 443,000 |\n| Total | 18,400 | 0.98 | 582,000 |\nNotes:\n-\nNumbers have been rounded to reflect the precision of a Mineral Resource estimate. Totals may vary due to rounding.\n-\nGold cut-off has been calculated based on a gold price of US$1,600 per oz, mining costs of US$1.5/tonne for saprolite-transition and US$2.0/tonne for fresh rock, processing costs of US$6.0/tonne for saprolite-transition and US$12.0/tonne for fresh rock, and mine-site administration costs of US$3.0/tonne. Metallurgical recoveries of 95% are based on prior test work.\n-\nMineral Resources conform to NI 43-101, and the 2019 CIM Estimation of Mineral Resources & Mineral Reserves Best Practice Guidelines and 2014 CIM Definition Standards for Mineral Resources & Mineral Reserves.\n-\nThe Company is not aware of any environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, or political factors that might materially affect these Mineral Resource estimates.\n-\nMineral resources are not mineral reserves as they do not have demonstrated economic viability. The quantity and grade of reported inferred resources in this mineral resource estimate are uncertain in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to define these inferred resources as indicated or measured resources, however, it is reasonably expected that the majority of inferred mineral resources could be upgraded to indicated mineral resources with continued exploration.\nQualified Persons\nThe Independent Qualified Persons, as defined in NI 43-101, for the PEA and who have verified and approved the contents of this news release are Nigel Fung, P.Eng, of ERM (Mining and Economic Model), Leon McGarry, P.Geo, an ERM Associate (Mineral Resource), and Antoine Berton, P.Eng, Ph.D. of Soutex (Processing).\nAll scientific and technical data contained in this presentation has been reviewed and approved by N.

NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators that establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects.\nCanadian public disclosure standards, including NI 43-101, differ significantly from the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), and information concerning mineralization, deposits, mineral reserve and mineral resource information contained or referred to herein may not be comparable to similar information disclosed by U.S. companies. In particular, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this news release uses the terms \"indicated mineral resources\", and \"inferred mineral resources'\". U.S. investors are advised that, while such terms are recognized and required by Canadian securities laws, the SEC does not recognize them. The requirements of NI 43-101 for identification of \"reserves\" are not the same as those of the SEC, and may not qualify as \"reserves\" under SEC standards. Under U.S. standards, mineralization may not be classified as a \"reserve\" unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that any part of an \"indicated mineral resource\" will ever be converted into a \"reserve\". U.S. investors should also understand that \"inferred mineral resources\" have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of \"inferred mineral resources\" exist, are economically or legally mineable or will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Disclosure of \"contained metal\" in a mineral resource is permitted disclosure under Canadian securities laws. However, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute \"reserves\" by SEC standards as in place tonnage and grade, without reference to unit measures. Accordingly, information concerning mineral deposits set forth herein may not be comparable with information made public by companies that report in accordance with U.S. standards.\nNon-IFRS Financial Measures\nGoldsource has included certain non-IFRS financial measures in this news release, such as development capital expenditures, sustaining capital expenditures, total cash costs, all-in sustaining costs, and free cash flow, which are not measures recognized under IFRS and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS. As a result, these measures may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. Each of these measures used are intended to provide additional information to the user and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. Non-IFRS financial measures used in this news release and common to the gold mining industry are defined below.\nDevelopment Capital Expenditures\nDevelopment capital expenditures represents the spending at new projects and/or expenditures at an existing operation that is undertaken with the intention to increase production levels or increase the mine life.\nSustained Capital Expenditures\nSustaining capital expenditures are expenditures incurred during a production phase to sustain and maintain the existing assets so they can achieve constant expected levels of production from which the Company will derive economic benefits. Sustaining capital expenditures include expenditure for assets to retain their existing productive capacity as well as to enhance performance and reliability of the operations.\nTotal Cash Costs and Total Cash Costs per Ounce\nTotal cash costs are reflective of the cost of production. Total cash costs reported in the PEA include mining costs, processing, general and administrative costs of the mine, off-site costs, refining costs, transportation costs and royalties. Total cash costs per ounce is calculated as total cash costs divided by payable gold ounces.\nAll-In Sustaining Costs and All-In Sustaining Costs per Ounce\nSite-level all-in sustaining costs and all-in sustaining costs per ounce are reflective of all of the expenditures that are required to produce an ounce of gold from operations. All-in sustaining costs reported in the PEA include total cash costs, sustaining capital, but exclude corporate general and administrative and exploration costs. All-in sustaining costs per ounce is calculated as all-in sustaining costs divided by payable gold ounces.\nA description of the significant cost components that make up the forward looking non-IFRS financial measures of total cash costs and all-in sustaining costs per ounce of payable gold produced is shown in Table 7 of this new release.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flows are revenues net of operating costs, royalties, capital expenditures and cash taxes.\nNeither TSX-V nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in policies of the TSX-V) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nTo view the source version of this press release, please visit https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/194325",

Investors have long bought gold to offer a measure of protection from the risks of inflation and market volatility.\nLearn: How To Invest In Gold\nMore: Pocket an Extra $400 a Month With This Simple Hack\nWith inflation still well above the Federal Reserve\u2019s target of 2%, many experts predict a big year for gold in 2024. Gold is in hot demand as an investment, a status symbol and a key component in many electronic products.\n\u201cWhen inflation rates rise, gold prices often increase as well,\u201d Gold IRA Guide analyst Liam Hunt tells MarketWatch. \u201cIf current trends of economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures continue, there could be upward pressure on gold prices.\u201d\nAlmost everyone is hedging that gold will rise next year, with some analysts predicting values to reach a bullish $2,300 per ounce (it\u2019s selling at around $2,035 today), says CBS News. But what about gold makes it such a long-term, safe investment? Here\u2019s five reasons gold is a good bet during economic turmoil.\nAn Inflation Hedge\nGold is often seen as a hedge against inflation. During periods of rising prices, the value of fiat currencies (those not backed by a commodity, like gold or silver) may decline. Still, gold tends to maintain its value or even appreciate.\n\u201cGold is the best hedge there is and every portfolio,\u201d says Collin Plume, founder of Noble Gold Investments. \u201cWe have an average of an economic downturn every 5.5 years. Each time a downturn happens, you need that one asset that will keep you buoyant while you wait for the rest of your portfolio to recover.\u201d\nAn Historical Store of Value\nThe value of gold has been on an upward trajectory over the last century. As the United States Gold Bureau notes, in contrast to the declining value of the U.S. dollar over time, gold\u2019s value has \u201cexploded.\u201d Throughout history, gold has retained its purchasing power, making it a reliable asset during economic uncertainties.\nDiversification\nThink of gold as the outsider in your portfolio. The whole point of diversification is to include assets from different classes that aren\u2019t correlated to help reduce overall risk. The relation between gold and stocks is essentially zero.\nA Global Acceptance\nRecognized and accepted globally, and not tied to any specific country, gold is a universal store of value that can be easily traded or converted into other assets. NPR calls gold an \u201cold-school investment.\u201d But global demand for the precious metal increased 20% last year and its value sits at a decade high.",

[EIA/S] [EIA/A]\nEnergy firms also pulled 4.1 million barrels out of distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, and 4.5 million barrels out of gasoline stockpiles last week.\nThat compares with analysts forecasts for much smaller weekly withdrawals of 0.7 million barrels of distillates and 1.6 million barrels of gasoline.\n\u201cThe draw down in gasoline and distillates has the market\u2019s attention. This is a wake up call that we have a very tight market,\u201d Price Futures Group analyst Phil Flynn said.\nIn remarks prepared for Congress, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank still expects to reduce its benchmark interest rate later this year, though policymakers still needed \"greater confidence\" in inflation's continued decline.\nComplicating the Fed's decision, however, were reports providing mixed signals. U.S. private payrolls increased slightly less than expected in February, bolstering the case for rate cuts, while data showing an uptick in U.S. economic activity from early January through late February supported the case for leaving rates unchanged.\nThe U.S. dollar slipped to a one-month low against a basket of other currencies after Powell's comments.\nA weaker dollar can boost demand for oil by making the fuel cheaper for buyers using other currencies.\nAROUND THE WORLD\nChina announced a 2024 economic growth target of around 5%, though the lack of big-ticket stimulus plans to bolster its struggling economy raised concerns of sluggish oil demand growth.\nThe market \"specifically was hoping to see further fiscal expansion to help meet the growth target,\" said Tony Sycamore, an analyst at IG in Sydney.",

Here\u2019s how\nCar insurance premiums in America are through the roof \u2014 and only getting worse. But less than 2 minutes can save you more than $600/year\nThese 5 magic money moves will boost you up America's net worth ladder in 2024 \u2014 and you can complete each step within minutes. Here's how\n\u201cI just purchased an egg salad sandwich for my dinner in Waikiki. Price $14.00,\u201d he shared in a post on X. \u201cI can afford $14 yet the price still is hard to swallow.\u201d\nWith an estimated net worth of $100 million, Kiyosaki\u2019s surprise at the cost of a simple sandwich underscores the high cost of living many are facing today.\nIn the same post on X, Kiyosaki expanded on the issue:\n\u201cTHE EVERYTHING BUBBLE I wrote about in my last two tweets has caused millions of Millennials, Gen X and Gen Zs\u2026 even a few Baby Boomers[\u2026] to claim they cannot afford a house, or have kids, or live at the same standard of living as their parents.\u201d\nKiyosaki expressed empathy for younger generations, noting that he grew up with similar doubts. Yet, with \u201creal estate and the cost of living so high in Hawaii,\u201d he also wonders how \u201cyoung people today\u2026 survive.\u201d\nThe cost of living crisis isn\u2019t limited to Hawaii. Across the U.S., inflation continues to bite. Since the beginning of 2020, the consumer price index has increased by 22%.\n\u2018The everything crash\u2019\nKiyosaki\u2019s concerns about inflation go beyond just rising consumer prices \u2014 he\u2019s also warning of a major market downturn.\nHe describes how \u201cThe Everything Bubble\u201d formed in the past.\n\u201cIn 2008 was the GFC the Great Financial Crisis. The criminals at the Fed and Treasury began printing trillions of fake dollars in an attempt to stop a GFD a.k.a\u2026.a Global \u2018F-ing\u2019 Depression,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cThe 2008 GFC blew up into \u2018The Everything Bubble.\u2019 All markets began to rise\u2026 floating on a sea of fake money.\u201d\nIn short, Kiyosaki believes that excessive money printing fueled the bubble by inflating asset prices across the board.\nNow, he predicts even more serious consequences.\n\u201cWhat I am attempting to say is \u2018The Everything Bubble\u2019 is going to turn into \u2018The Everything Crash,\u2019\u201d he predicts, vividly comparing the impending collapse to \u201cMt. Vesuvius blowing up.\u201d\nIn recent years, the U.S. stock market has experienced a remarkable rally, with the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all hitting new highs.\nHowever, Kiyosaki points out that savvy investors are already offloading overpriced assets and moving into cash.\nHe highlighted Warren Buffett, whose company, Berkshire Hathaway, has sold a significant portion of its Apple shares this year. \u201cWarren Buffett is selling even his Apple shares and sitting on stacks of cash,\u201d Kiyosaki noted.\nSo, how do you navigate the bubble and the impending crash? Kiyosaki points to three key assets.\n\u201cIf a major stock market crash occurs\u2026 Which I am expecting\u2026 Because the stock market has been high for too many years\u2026 This is not good news for people who do NOT own gold, silver, and Bitcoin,\u201d he warned on X.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Kiyosaki has promoted these assets. His confidence in them remains strong, as he boldly declared that \u201cBitcoin, gold, silver prices [are] about to EXPLODE.\u201d\nGold and silver have long been considered popular hedges against inflation. The reason is straightforward: these precious metals can\u2019t be printed in unlimited quantities by central banks like fiat money.\nAnd because their value isn\u2019t tied to any one currency or economy, these metals could provide protection during periods of economic uncertainty.\nIn October 2023, Kiyosaki predicted, \u201cGold will soon break through $2,100 and then take off. You will wish you had bought gold below $2,000. Next stop: gold $3,700.\u201d\nIt seems the first part of his prediction is materializing. Gold prices have surged in 2024, now hovering around $2,750 per ounce.\nKiyosaki is also bullish on silver, recently telling his followers on X that the \u201cBEST ASSET TODAY: Silver\u2026 buy it before it hits $50.00.\u201d\nWith silver currently trading at $34.40, his target suggests a potential 45% upside for the metal.\nThese days, there are many ways to gain exposure to gold and silver. You can own bullion, buy shares of precious metals mining companies or ETFs, or even tap into potential tax advantages with a gold IRA.\nBitcoin is another hot asset in 2024, having surged about 60% year-to-date.\nWhile some see Bitcoin as the new gold, Kiyosaki doesn\u2019t dwell on comparisons between the two. \u201cIt really matters little which is better, gold or Bitcoin. That would [be] like people discussing which car is better\u2026 Ferrari or Lamborghini\u2026 as they take the bus,\u201d he wrote.\nHowever, Bitcoin\u2019s volatility is something Kiyosaki acknowledges. He warns that the cryptocurrency could crash to $5,000 before surging to $100,000, $250,000, or even higher.\nStill, Kiyosaki paints a clear picture of the future for those who own these assets.\n\u201cThose who own real gold, silver, and Bitcoin will get richer\u2026 able to afford Ferraris or Lamborghinis\u2026 while talkers who take the bus\u2026 say to themselves\u2026 \u2018I really do not like either Ferraris or Lamborghinis,\u2019\u201d he quipped.",

Around 75% of the mineral reserves are located in the Americas and Australia.\nSource: Newmont Presentation\nHowever, the stock tumbled on Feb. 22, despite a bullish gold price above $2,000 per ounce, for four primary reasons:\nThe company announced a quarterly dividend cut of nearly 37%, from 40 cents to 25 cents per share.\nThe company indicated disappointing 2024 production guidance with an expected 6.93 million ounces of gold.\nNewmont plans to sell non-tier 1 assets after acquiring Newcrest Mining for approximately $15 billion to reduce its $8.87 billion in debt.\nFinally, Newmont took a $1.20 billion non-cash impairment charge related to its Penasquito mine in Mexico.\nChief Financial Officer Karyn Ovelmen said during the conference call, \"Divestiture proceeds will first be allocated to maintaining our minimum cash balance of approximately $3 billion and will then be applied to reducing debt to $8 million or below.\"\nEanings highlights\nThe earnings results for the fourth quarter were mixed, with better-than-expected revenue of $3.95 billion, up from $3.20 billion in the prior-year quarter, and a net loss of $3.21 per diluted share. However, adjusted income was 50 cents per share, falling short of analysts' expectations.\nAttributable gold production was 1,741,000 ounces and attributable gold equivalent production was 2,030,000 GEOs. JV Nevada Gold Mines produced 322,000 ounces, down slightly from 324,000 ounces last year. Production numbers were better than expected.\nNewmont sold its gold production for a record $2,004 per ounce, compared to $1,758 a year ago.\nLiquidity was strong with $3.03 billion of consolidated cash and approximately $6.10 billion in liquidity; the reported net debt-to-adjusted Ebitda ratio was 1.10.\nRevenue in 2023 was $11.81 billion, slightly lower than in 2022 ($11.92 billion). 2023 GEO production was 6,433,000, compared to 7,231,000 in 2022.\nDuring the conference call, CEO Tom Palmer said, \"Newmont finished the year with a solid fourth quarter, putting us in line with the revised stand-alone outlook that we issued following the resolution of the strike at Penasquito. In summary, we produced 5.5 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of $1,444 an ounce. In addition to gold, we produced nearly 900,000 gold equivalent ounces from copper, silver, lead, and zinc over the course of the year.\"\nGold production per mine\nNewmont's attributable gold production increased significantly in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, owing primarily to the Newcrest acquisition, which added five new producing assets.\nHowever, the production loss at the Penasquito mine was significant and painful this quarter, as shown below.\nStock performance and commentary\nNewmont is one of my long-term gold miners, along with Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD), Agnico Eagle (NYSE:AEM) and Kinross Gold (NYSE:KGC). Unfortunately, the company has consistently underperformed the group over the past year, and recent dividend cuts have not helped. The stock is down over 30% on a one-year basis.\nThree critical issues emerged in 2023, significantly impacting the stock.\nThe 120-day illegal labor dispute at Penasquito significantly impacted the stock, resulting in a loss of 100,000 gold ounces in the fourth quarter.\nSecond, there were concerns about asset integrity at the Ahafo mine.\nThe wildfires in Canada had an impact on Eleonore.\nFinally, the recent delay and extra cost of the Tanami project.\nNote: Graph created by Fun Trading/StockCharts\nMany investors have given up on Newmont, which is a major mistake. According to Baron Rothschild, \"the time to buy is when there is blood on the streets,\" precisely what this gold miner encountered.\nSelling at this level is absurd and demonstrates your emotions have influenced your judgment. Even with a reduced quarterly dividend of 25 cents per share, investors receive a 3.13% yield and have the potential for significant stock appreciation from those levels, with gold spot trading at a record of $2,127 per ounce today.\nThe most important aspect of investing is to tailor your trading strategy to the stock you have invested in. The company is financially stable and expects to produce 8.3 million gold equivalent ounces in 2028, as shown in the presentation below. Thus, why sell now rather than continue a slow accumulation?\nSource: Newmont presentation\nThe most straightforward trading strategy is to trade LIFO and use 40% to 50% of your total position to trade short-term using technical analysis. It is a simple strategy that allows you to accumulate a recurring short-term gain while enabling you to keep a long-term position, often underwater, until the stock turnarounds.\nAll-in sustaining costs increased quarter to $1,485 per ounce from $1,166 per ounce a year ago. The AISC is too high, but will drop after fully integrating the Newcrest acquisition.\nPalmer said during the conference call, \"Newmont will produce a significant amount of copper, along with silver, lead, zinc and molybdenum with our global diversified Tier 1 portfolio. Driven by this high metal production and with a focus on improving costs, we expect to deliver all-in sustaining costs bringing our go-forward portfolio down to $1,150 per ounce by 2027.\"\nThe quarter was solid for gold production after adding production from Newcrest. Gold production was 1,741,000 ounces and total gold equivalent production was 2,030,000 gold equivalent ounces. As we can see in the chart below, it was a big jump from the preceding quarter.\nThe chart below shows gold production per producing mine, including Goldcorp, Newcrest and the Barrick/Newmont joint venture (of which Newmont owns 38.50%).\nBalance Sheet and Commentary\nNewmont's revenue totaled $3.96 billion for the fourth quarter.\nRevenue was $3.96 billion, with a net loss of $3.14 billion, or $3.21 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter, compared to a loss of $1.47 million, or $1.86 per diluted share, in the same quarter last year. The adjusted net income was 50 cents per diluted share. Adjusted net income was 50 cents per diluted share.\nRevenue repartition per metal mined\nAs shown below, Nemont's gold production accounted for 89.70% of its total revenue. The recent Newcrest acquisition, which will increase copper production, will likely cause the ratio to shift slightly downward.\nThe company also reported a $304 million free cash flow deficit.\nIts trailing 12-month free cash flow was $97 million, with a disappointing deficit of $304 million in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures were particularly high at $920 million, while cash from operations decreased to $616 million from $1.01 billion a year ago.\nIt is likely why management decided to reduce the quarterly dividend from 40 cents to 25 cents per share.\nThe miner's long-term debt (including current debt) was $5.57 billion at the end of June.\nThe total cash is $3.02 billion, with a long-term debt of $8.87 billion. This debt profile has changed significantly since the Newcrest acquisition in November 2023. The net debt-to-adjusted Ebitda ratio is 1.10.\nOn March 4, Newmont launched a private offering for notes due in 2026 and 2034. The company said the notes will be guaranteed on an unsecured senior basis by Newmont USA Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Newmont. According to the press release:\n\"The Issuers intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from the Offering to repay all outstanding borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facility, with the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes. The Company previously used borrowings under its revolving credit facility, along with cash on hand, to repay approximately US$1.9 billion aggregate principal amount of bilateral credit debt acquired by Newmont as part of its acquisition of Newcrest Mining Limited.\"\nTechnical snalysis (short term) and commentary\nNote: The chart has been adjusted for dividends.\nNewmont trades in a descending channel pattern, with resistance at $34 and support at $29.25.\nTechnical analysts use bearish chart formations, known as descending channel patterns, to detect potential market downtrends. However, these formations frequently result in a breakout.\nThe short-term trading strategy is to trade LIFO for approximately 45% of your position while holding a core long-term amount for a significantly higher payout.\nI recommend selling between $33.50 and $35, with possible higher resistance at $38.20, and then waiting for a retracement between $30.75 and $29.25, with possible lower support at $29.",

As the global economy opened back up, demand skyrocketed and supply chains couldn't keep up. Given that backdrop, it shouldn't be too surprising that inflation has been heading higher. Fear about inflation, meanwhile, often results in investors looking for investments that can provide inflation protection. Gold has been a beneficiary. But what's the best way to add precious metals to your portfolio?\nInvestors are seeking safe harbors\nThere are no perfect investments. Everything comes with a trade-off. For example, safe income stocks often lack growth appeal. Or, in this case, buying a hard asset like a gold coin means you will only ever own that gold coin. But what does that gold bullion do for you? When inflation is raging gold prices often move higher because it is considered a store of wealth. Right now gold prices are near historical highs.\nEssentially, gold is one of the oldest forms of currency. And many investors believe that owning this precious metal is a way to protect against the decline in value of fiat currency. Fiat currency is backed only by the governments that issue it while gold is, well, a real physical item. There are a few ways you can add precious metals to your portfolio.\nThe first is to actually buy bullion (like gold coins). Transaction fees are high, you need to store it safely, and, as noted, a gold coin will only ever be a gold coin. You can, instead, buy a gold-backed exchange-traded fund. That helps to keep costs down and relieves you of the need to store it. But the gold in the fund won't grow over time like a business could.\nThis is why many investors prefer owning precious metals miners. They sell gold and other metals, so their financial performance tends to track along with gold prices. But they can invest in their business and expand (by opening new mines, for example). While perhaps not the same as holding a gold coin in your hand, it is a balance between inflation protection and the growth potential that a gold coin lacks. But if that sounds good to you, then you should probably consider a fourth option -- streaming and royalty companies.\nPaying up front for low prices later\nOne of the big risks with a miner is that building and operating mines is expensive, complicated, and sometimes dangerous. When something goes wrong it can materially impact a miner's financial performance. Streaming and royalty companies reduce the risks investors have to face. Companies like Royal Gold(NASDAQ: RGLD), Wheaton Precious Metals(NYSE: WPM), and Franco-Nevada(NYSE: FNV) don't actually operate any mines, but they do have direct exposure to precious metals.\nEssentially, streaming and royalty companies provide miners cash for the right to buy precious metals in the future at advantageous prices. The miners often use the money they get to build mines, though sometimes it can go to other things, like strengthening their balance sheets. This cash infusion means that the miner doesn't have to issue shares or sell debt to raise capital. And often the gold and silver they promise to sell to Royal Gold, Wheaton, and Franco-Nevada is actually a byproduct of another metal they are mining, like copper. So it isn't the main focus anyway. It is pretty close to a win/win deal.\nWhat increases the attractiveness for investors here is that the upfront cash is all Royal Gold, Wheaton, and Franco-Nevada are expected to put in (other than the need to buy the precious metals at reduced rates in the future, but that effectively ensures they will make a profit on the transaction). If costs rise, that's on the miner. The only real issue that will pass through to the streaming and royalty company is something that disrupts production, like a mine stoppage. Obviously the miner can't sell gold to anyone if there's no gold being produced. This is an issue for Franco-Nevada right now because one of its largest mines has stopped producing, leading to a deep downturn in the stock price relative to its peers. That could make it the best option for contrarian investors right now, but go in knowing that it could take a while for this situation to be resolved.\nThere's another important benefit. Because Royal Gold, Wheaton, and Franco-Nevada are, essentially, investing in precious metals mines, they tend to have fairly well diversified portfolios. A miner might have just a few operating assets but streaming and royalty companies usually have dozens of investments, some operating and some in an earlier stage of development. For example, Royal Gold's portfolio contains 181 properties spread across 17 countries. That's more diversification than you would get from any miner.\nMeanwhile, all three of these stocks pay dividends. Royal Gold and Franco-Nevada focus on providing a growing stream of income. Wheaton, on the other hand, has a variable dividend policy that is driven by the company's financial performance. So when precious metals prices are high investors will benefit more directly from the lofty commodity prices. That probably won't interest conservative income investors, but it might be attractive to more active investors specifically looking to gold as an inflation hedge. Essentially, if precious metals prices rise along with inflation, the dividend from Wheaton might just be on the rise, too.\nDon't go all in on gold\nGold and silver are commodities and they can be volatile. It is probably best to view companies like Royal Gold, Wheaton, and Franco-Nevada as diversification tools, making up a modest amount of your portfolio (maybe 5% or so). And it is important to highlight that some on Wall Street question the actual inflation hedging benefit of gold and silver. But that just makes owning a streaming company, which can actually grow its business, all the more interesting as an alternative to bullion. Add in the reduced execution risk relative to a miner and Royal Gold, Wheaton, and Franco-Nevada start to look increasingly compelling for investors that want to add precious metals to their portfolio mix.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Wheaton Precious Metals right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Wheaton Precious Metals, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Wheaton Precious Metals wasn't one of them.

At a time when global demand for copper is expected to surge, the Agreement, which involves gold only, preserves the revenue streams from the significant copper, silver, and a large portion of the gold resources at Cascabel for SolGold and its shareholders while also fulfilling SolGold's commitment to royalty holders, the Ecuadorian Government, and stakeholders to advance the Project.\nThe Agreement includes a buyback option for five years following the closing of the stream transaction, exercisable upon a change of control transaction of SolGold, to reduce the stream by 50% within three years of the closing date of the Agreement or by 33.33% thereafter until the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the Agreement. This buyback option provides SolGold with exceptional strategic flexibility.\nKey Highlights\n-\nValidates Cascabel's position as a world-class copper-gold project\n-\nRepresents a substantial contribution towards the estimated US$1.55 billion funding required for the construction of Cascabel, per the 2024 NI 43-101 Pre-Feasibility Study (\"PFS\") (See News Release of 16 February 2024: Link), while maintaining the first-quartile cost profile\n-\nValidates the 2024 PFS that demonstrates an after-tax NPV8 of US$3.2bn and an after-tax IRR of 24% based on a 4-year development period for an initial 12 Mtpa operation ramping up to 24 Mtpa at conservative prices (US$3.85/lb Cu and US$1,750/oz Au)\n-\nCompetitive cost of capital at ~9% based on the 2024 PFS\n-\nProvides sufficient funds to advance the Project to a Final Development Investment Decision, including completion of feasibility studies, any required engineering studies, and financing completion\n-\nEnables the completion of the Project's environmental permitting subject to process and government approval\n-\nFlexibility to reduce gold deliveries into the stream upon a change of control via a buyback option\n-\nSignificant due diligence and financial commitment from Franco-Nevada and Osisko further confirm the extensive work completed by SolGold\n-\nCommitment by Franco-Nevada and Osisko to significantly support environmental and community projects, reflecting their dedication to sustainable development and social responsibility\nScott Caldwell, President and CEO of SolGold, remarked: \"We are thrilled to finalize this transformative US$750 million gold stream with Franco-Nevada and Osisko. This Agreement not only secures a significant portion of the capital required to fund the construction of Cascabel but also validates the vast potential of the Cascabel Project. The US$100 million dedicated to de-risking and technical work is crucial for the next steps in our project development. We are committed to advancing our operations responsibly and efficiently, and this partnership is a testament to our progress to date and the promising future ahead. Finally, this major investment in Ecuador reflects the strong support from the Ecuadorian government for the mining industry.\"\nPaul Brink, President and CEO of Franco-Nevada, commented: \"We are excited to support SolGold in the development of their world-class Cascabel project. This gold stream agreement aligns with our strategy to invest in high-quality assets with significant growth potential. We believe SolGold's flagship project will be amongst the next generation of large copper development projects and will contribute meaningfully to our longer-term growth. We are pleased to provide pre-construction funding to derisk project development and project financing that provides a balance of funding certainty and financial flexibility.\"\nJason Attew, President and CEO of Osisko Gold Royalties, commented: \"Cascabel represents one of the most significant copper-gold discoveries in recent history. The project has the potential to become a world-class multi-generational mine, demonstrated by the recent PFS estimating at least a 28-year mine life with numerous avenues for additional mine life extensions. This new stream investment, which complements Osisko's existing royalty on the project, will help to support the development of this exceptional asset and enhance Osisko's long-term growth profile.\"\nSummary of Agreement Terms\n\u00b7 Initial Deposit: US$100 million, paid in three tranches, aimed at further de-risking, defining and enhancing value-adding opportunities at Cascabel, and completing financing activities and the feasibility study. SolGold expects the three tranches of the Initial Deposit to provide sufficient funds to advance the Project to a Final Development Investment Decision. The required de-risking, engineering, financing, and permitting activities are anticipated to take approximately 24 months to complete.\no First Tranche: $33.4 million will be available to SolGold upon the finalization of customary closing documents and is expected to be received later today\no Second Tranche: $33.3 million (expected in 2025) will be available upon certain conditions precedent being met, including, but not limited to, the execution of the amended investment protection agreement, completion of the geotechnical drilling, and finalization of the tailings storage facility (\"TSF\") design sufficient for a minimum of 10 years of operation and prepared in accordance with applicable requirements.\no Third Tranche: $33.3 million (expected at the end of Q4 2025) to be disbursed upon certain conditions precedent being met, including, but not limited to, submission of all final permit applications for the construction and operation of the Project and the TSF, and other necessary documentation.\n-\nConstruction Deposit: US$650 million for Project development upon certain conditions precedent having been met, including, but not limited to, a board-approved Final Development Investment Decision and evidence of the availability of all equity and other sources of funds for full funding to completion. The deposit is payable in instalments upon achieving specific milestones, permits, and approvals related to Project advancement and construction.\n-\nGold Deliveries: The Syndicate will receive an amount in reference to 20% of the recovered gold in concentrate from Cascabel until 750,000 ounces of gold have been provided, after which the percentage will reduce to 12% for the life of the mine. The Agreement only applies to the gold produced from the Cascabel concession. Any production from other properties owned by SolGold that is not processed through the Project mill or infrastructure is not subject to the Agreement.\n-\nProduction Payments: The Syndicate will make ongoing production payments to SolGold equivalent to 20% of the spot gold price at the time for each ounce of gold delivered to the Syndicate under the Agreement.\n-\nChange of Control Provisions: The Agreement includes a staged buyback option upon a change of control transaction, which provides the option to reduce the gold stream by 50% within three years of the closing date of the Agreement and 33.33% thereafter until the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the Agreement.\n-\nLoan Repayment: The previously disclosed US$10 million loan with Franco-Nevada Corporation, maturing on 19 July 2024, will be repaid from proceeds from the first tranche of the Initial Deposit.\nNext Steps\nSolGold plans to initiate the next phase of Project advancement immediately, focusing on geotechnical drilling of the tailings storage facility, additional metallurgical testing, reserves definition at the Tandayama-Amer\u00edca deposit, hydroelectric power opportunities, plant location, and mine site design and layout, as well as securing necessary land access rights for infrastructure and commencing work on the FS. Throughout this period, SolGold will work closely with Franco-Nevada and Osisko to meet all agreed milestones and ensure timely disbursements of funds to SolGold.\nAdditional Financing Sources\nSolGold management continues to review additional funding options for Project development to fully fund the US$1.55 billion required for the Cascabel Project. These options may include, but are not limited to, funding from international development banks and off-take agreements with smelting companies.\nEconomic Impact, Community Engagement, and Government Support\nThe Cascabel Project represents the most significant investment in Ecuador's mining history. It is expected to generate substantial economic benefits, employment, and economic opportunities both on the Project and downstream. The Ecuadorian government has shown strong support for the Cascabel Project, recognising its potential to significantly boost the Ecuadorian economy. The government's commitment to creating a favorable investment environment has been crucial in advancing this historic investment.\nSolGold is committed to sustainable development and will continue to engage with local communities to ensure the Project delivers long-term positive impacts. The support from the Ecuadorian government and the ongoing engagement with local communities are essential components of the Project's success and its positive contribution to the region.\nCertain information contained in this announcement would have been deemed inside information.\nCONTACTS\n| Scott Caldwell SolGold Plc (CEO) | Tel: +44 (0) 20 3807 6996 |\n| Tavistock (Media) Jos Simson/Gareth Tredway | Tel: +44 (0) 20 7920 3150 |\nABOUT SOLGOLD\nSolGold is a leading resources company focused on the discovery, definition, and development of world-class copper and gold deposits and continues to strive to deliver objectives efficiently and in the interests of shareholders.\nThe Company operates with transparency and in accordance with international best practices.

Forward\u2011looking information includes, but is not limited to, statements regarding the Company's plans for developing its properties. Generally, forward\u2011looking information can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \"plans\", \"expects\" or \"does not expect\", \"is expected\", \"budget\", \"scheduled\", \"estimates\", \"forecasts\", \"intends\", \"anticipates\" or \"does not anticipate\", or \"believes\", or variations of such words and phrases or state that certain actions, events or results \"may\", \"could\", \"would\", \"might\" or \"will be taken\", \"occur\" or \"be achieved\".\nForward\u2011looking information is subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward\u2011looking information, including but not limited to: transaction risks; general business, economic, competitive, political and social uncertainties; future prices of mineral prices; accidents, labour disputes and shortages and other risks of the mining industry.

There can be no assurance that such information will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward-looking information include, but are not limited to, risks relating to the ability of exploration activities (including assay results) to accurately predict mineralization; errors in management's geological modelling and/or mine development plan; capital and operating costs varying significantly from estimates; the preliminary nature of visual assessments; delays in obtaining or failures to obtain required governmental, environmental or other required approvals; uncertainties relating to the availability and costs of financing needed in the future; changes in equity markets; inflation; the global economic climate; fluctuations in commodity prices; the ability of the Company to complete further exploration activities, including drilling; delays in the development of projects; environmental risks; community and non-governmental actions; other risks involved in the mineral exploration and development industry; the ability of the Company to retain its key management employees and skilled and experienced personnel; and those risks set out in the Company's public documents filed on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward\u2011looking information. The Company does not undertake to update any forward-looking information, except in accordance with applicable securities laws.\nThe Company and its officers do not endorse, or reject or otherwise comment on the conclusions, interpretations or views expressed in press articles or third-party analysis.\nThe Company recognises that the term World Class is subjective and for the purpose of the Company's projects the Company considers the drilling results at the Alpala porphyry copper-gold deposit at its Cascabel project to represent intersections of a World Class deposit on the basis of comparisons with other drilling intersections from World Class deposits, some of which have become, or are becoming, producing mines and on the basis of available independent opinions which may be referenced to define the term \"World Class\" (or \"Tier 1\").\nThe Company considers that World Class deposits are rare, very large, long life, low cost, and are responsible for approximately half of total global metals production. World Class deposits are generally accepted as deposits of a size and quality that create multiple expansion opportunities and have or are likely to demonstrate robust economics that ensure development irrespective of position within the global commodity cycles, or whether or not the deposit has been fully drilled out, or a feasibility study completed.\nStandards drawn from industry experts (1Singer and Menzie, 2010; 2Schodde, 2006; 3Schodde and Hronsky, 2006; 4Singer, 1995; 5Laznicka, 2010) have characterised World Class deposits at prevailing commodity prices. The relevant criteria for World Class deposits, adjusted to current long run commodity prices, are considered to be those holding or likely to hold more than 5 million tonnes of copper and/or more than 6 million ounces of gold with a modelled net present value of greater than US$1billion.\nThe Company cautions that the Cascabel Project remains an early-stage project at this time and there is inherent uncertainty relating to any project at prior to the determination of pre-feasibility study and/or defined feasibility study.\nOn this basis, reference to the Cascabel Project as \"World Class\" (or \"Tier 1\") is considered to be appropriate.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

In this case, the greenback could see its strongest gains against the Swedish krona (SEK), rising by 10.8%, and the euro (EUR), with an anticipated increase of 8.4%.\nConversely, if Harris wins with a split Congress, JPMorgan expects the dollar to experience its steepest decline, with the trade-weighted dollar index potentially dropping by 5.4%. This outcome would likely lead to a weaker dollar as trade tensions ease and economic priorities shift.\nThe table below highlights JPMorgan\u2019s projected currency movements over the next one to two quarters under various election outcomes, providing forex traders with insights into how the 2024 U.S. election could shape the dollar\u2019s trajectory.\nRepublican Sweep\n+7.3%\n+4.4%\n+8.4%\n+4.7%\n+6.1%\n+7.9%\n+10.8%\nTrump w/ Split Congress\n+3.3%\n+3.0%\n+4.3%\n+3.3%\n-5.4%\n+4.6%\n+5.0%\nHarris w/ Split Congress\n-5.4%\n-2.7%\n-3.9%\n-4.0%\n-4.0%\n-2.9%\n-5.6%\nDemocratic Sweep\n-3.9%\n-2.0%\n-3.1%\n-2.5%\n-0.7%\n-1.4%\n-4.6%\nSource: J.P. Morgan Global FX Strategy\nWhy could Trump\u2019s tariffs trigger a dollar rally?\nEconomists at JPMorgan, the world's largest investment bank, estimate that the tariffs imposed during Trump's first term raised inflation by about 0.3% and shaved 0.4% off GDP growth.\nHowever, analysts at JPMorgan warn that a second Trump administration could cause even greater economic disruptions if tariffs are ramped up further.\n\"In the event of a Trump 2.0 administration, the impact from a tariff war 2.0 could be much higher,\" the JPMorgan team stated.\nThey project that a 60% tariff on all Chinese imports would raise U.S. consumer prices by 1.1%, while a universal 10% tariff on all imports could push inflation up by as much as 1.5%.\nIn a worst-case scenario\u2014where both a 60% tariff on Chinese goods and a 10% universal tariff are imposed\u2014inflation could spike by 2.4%, putting significant pressure on American consumers and businesses.\nThis inflationary surge would likely force the Federal Reserve to shift back to a more hawkish stance, reversing any plans to ease monetary policy.\nHigher interest rates would be necessary to counteract the inflationary impact of tariffs, which could create a stronger monetary policy divergence between the U.S. and other economies.\nFor the dollar, this scenario would represent a tailwind. Rising interest rates make U.S. assets, like Treasuries, more attractive to foreign investors due to their higher yields. This increased demand for U.S. assets, driven by yield differentials, would boost demand for dollars, strengthening the greenback further in the face of escalating trade tensions.\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities In A Shifting Market?\nThe changing interest rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\nFor instance, the Ascent Income Fund from EquityMultiple targets stable income from senior commercial real estate debt positions and has a historical distribution yield of 12.1% backed by real assets.

As a group, they have now attracted more than $30 billion in assets under management. In March, these spot Bitcoin ETFs set a record with more than $111 billion in overall trading volume, nearly tripling the volume from the previous month.\nBut how much longer can this record-setting pace continue? After all, the new Bitcoin ETFs are starting to see net outflows on some days and the price of Bitcoin seems to be stuck right around the $70,000 level. If you are thinking about investing in the new ETFs as a way of getting exposure to Bitcoin, there are three key factors to consider.\nThe Bitcoin halving\nFirst and foremost, there is the Bitcoin halving, which is set to take place on April 19. In a halving event, the mining reward paid out to Bitcoin miners gets slashed by half. This slows the growth in the supply of new bitcoins while making Bitcoin even more of an inflation-resistant asset.\nHalvings have historically driven huge price increases for Bitcoin. In the last halving cycle, which started in May 2020, the price of Bitcoin skyrocketed from $10,000 to an all-time high of almost $69,000 in November 2021. While past performance is certainly no guarantee of future results, this same pattern has occurred in two other halvings (in 2012 and 2016), so many Bitcoin investors are confident there will be a similar pattern this year.\nIf that's the case, then that's extremely good news for the new Bitcoin ETFs. A higher Bitcoin price attracts the attention of investors, who then decide to invest more money into Bitcoin, which sends the price higher, which then encourages even more investors to put their money into Bitcoin, and the cycle repeats. Past Bitcoin halving cycles have lasted anywhere from 12 to 18 months, so it's not out of the realm of possibility that the remainder of 2024 will see higher Bitcoin ETF inflows and trading volumes.\nBitcoin vs. gold\nMany crypto investors refer to Bitcoin as \"digital gold\" and view it as being similar to physical gold in terms of the role that it can play in their portfolios. They prize Bitcoin not just for its upside potential, but also for its potential ability to maintain its value during times of economic upheaval. Bitcoin has historically accounted for 20% to 30% of the \"store of value\" market, and some analysts think this number could eventually climb to 50%.\nThat's why the current economic situation is so fascinating. At the same time that Bitcoin is racing to all-time highs, so is gold. The price of gold is currently close to $2,370, but there are some who say that it could run as high as $3,000. Central banks appear to be buying gold hand over fist as a hedge against economic turmoil.",

To date in 2024, ten diamond drill holes have been completed totalling 3,732 metres (\"m\") and drilling continues. A second drill commenced in late August. Assays have been received for seven holes and additional assays are pending.\nHighlights include:\nHole 24ODD078\n2.20 g/t Au over 43.7 m\n3.13 g/t Au over 43.0 m\nHole 24ODD-076\n2.89 g/t Au over 22.0 m\n1.48 g/t Au over 22.0 m\nHole 24ODD-077\n2.46 g/t Au over 18.9 m\n1.01 g/t Au over 25.5 m\n2.08 g/t Au over 10.8 m\n4.19 g/t Au over 4.8 m\nHole 24ODD-075\n1.26 g/t Au over 21.5 m\nElaine Ellingham, President & CEO, commented, \"We are very pleased with these first results from our 2024 drill program and have doubled the size of the program to 10,000 m. Following completion of our Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Wenot open pit deposit in April, and a C$13m financing in June we prepared plans to drill several high potential areas on the Omai property that we believe will move us towards our goal of significantly expanding the mine plan for Omai beyond our baseline PEA, with higher annual production, a longer mine life and enhanced economics. The April PEA incorporates only 45% of the property's Mineral Resource Estimate and much of our planned program is also targeting an expansion to our already substantial gold resources.\"\nThe planned drill program for 2024-25 will test several areas, including extensions to Wenot to the east and west, splays identified to the northeast, at depth, and very importantly along the southern side of the Wenot deposit (Figure 1). The Wenot deposit is very large with a strike length of at least 2.4 km and with multiple subparallel gold mineralized zones spanning a 400+ m width (Figure 2). Additional targets on the Omai property will also be drilled as some are near surface and high grade that could bolster the grade profile in the early years of a production scenario.\nFigure 2. Wenot Long Sections. Wenot has a 2.4 km strike length and remains open in both directions. It has multiple subparallel zones. Each long section illustrated is 50m wide. Many of the zones are far north and south of the past producing pit and were not mined previously or only to very shallow depths. Most zones on the flanks have seen little to no drilling. These multiple zones hold high potential for overall resource expansion.\nAssays have been received for seven diamond drill holes. Four holes were completed (24ODD-075 to -078), testing large gaps on the south, sediment side of the Wenot deposit that were included in the PEA pit as \"waste\" but have seen little to no drilling. Gold mineralization within these sediment-hosted zones along strike provides evidence of the potential for these to continue through the gap areas. Identifying gold mineralization within these areas could positively impact a future economic study by converting \"waste\" within the model to mineralized material.\nHoles 24ODD-075 and -076 were drilled 305 m apart from the south side of Wenot, also testing the gap zones (Figure 3, Figure 4). Hole 24ODD-076 was most successful, intersecting 2.89 g/t Au over 22.0m within the sediments. This intercept appears to correlate to a zone in 24ODD-077 drilled from the north that intersected 1.0 g/t Au over 25.5m and likely to an interval further west in hole 23ODD-071 that returned 2.26 g/t Au over 70m. Hole -076 also intersected 0.9 g/t Au over 11.7m in the central contact quartz feldspar porphyry (\"QFP\"), as well as a rhyolite dike within the northern volcanics grading 1.5 g/t Au over 22.0m. Of significance, this wide rhyolite-hosted zone would appear to correlate to a mineralized rhyolite zone intersected 120m above in hole 23ODD-065 where it assayed 1.83 g/t Au over 25.0m. Hole 24ODD-075 intersected only minor gold mineralization within the sediments, however the central QFP assayed 1.3 g/t Au over 21.5m.\nHoles 24ODD-077 and -078 were drilled in the same general area as -075 and -076 but from the north side of the Wenot deposit. Hole -077 exemplifies the Wenot deposit, intersecting 10 different gold zones. Most notable is the central QFP that ran 2.46 g/t Au over 18.9m. In the sediments on the south side of the contact shear, three distinct zones assaying 1.01 g/t Au over 25.5m, 2.08 g/t over 10.8 m and 4.19 g/t over 4.8m were intersected. This is a great example of the potential these southern sediments hold for additional gold mineralization. This area was all categorized as waste or low grade within the PEA pit and with additional drilling and an updated model, management expects that these will contribute to an expanded resource and positively impact the economics of an updated PEA.\nHole 24ODD-078 also did not disappoint, intersecting 2.20 g/t Au over 43.7 m within the persistent corridor of volcanic-hosted felsic and diorite dikes, that was the focus of historic mining (Figure 5, Figure 6 - core photos). This zone appears to correlate to the interval in -076 grading 1.48 g/t Au over 22.0m, approximately 110m to the west, and possibly to the zone in 21ODD-002 approximately 210 m to the east which grades 3.65 g/t Au over 32.1m. Hole -078 also intersected a wide zone of significant gold mineralization around the central contact shear within the QFP and protomylonite assaying 3.13 g/t Au over 43.0 m. This included 11.01 g/t Au over 6.4 m in the QFP but also included a zone within the adjacent sediments to the south that ran 8.71 g/t Au over 4.5m. Again, this provides evidence of the gold potential of the sediments. Additional narrow zones of sediment-hosted mineralization were encountered further south.\nBased on these successes testing the \"gap zones\", additional holes have been planned and will proceed in the near-term. As per our operating methodology, a limited number of holes will be completed on specific targets and additional drilling on that each target awaits the assay results and interpretive work to optimize the effectiveness of the holes that follow.\nHoles 24-072 to 074 were drilled in the East Wenot area (Figure 7). Holes -072 and -073 tested a strong broad geophysics (IP) anomaly that was identified well south of the main Wenot contact shear, approximately 250 m east of the Wenot pit. An induced polarization geophysical survey was conducted in Q4 2023 and the best targets were selected for drill testing. Drill results to date are disappointing and the IP anomaly appears to be related to disseminated hematite (an iron oxide mineral). A felsic porphyry unit was intersected in hole -073 but without gold mineralization.\nTable 1.

Cut-off grade 0.30 g/t Au with maximum 3-4.5m internal dilution is applied.\nHole 24ODD-074 was a single initial hole to test along a zone of near-surface gold mineralization intersected by a series of very shallow holes completed in the early 1990s, in the East Wenot area. One zone in hole -074 assayed 1.10 g/t Au over 7.5m at a depth of about 120m. Additional systematic drilling is warranted due to the very shallow nature of the gold mineralization identified in this area, however the gap zones are considered a greater priority at this time.\nCurrently, a series of three 150-metre spaced drill holes is underway to test along the Wenot deposit at a depth of approximately 450m. Relative to other deposits in Guyana, the Wenot Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") of 834,000 indicated ounces of gold grading 1.48 g/t Au and 1,614,000 inferred ounces of gold grading 1.99 g/t Au is quite shallow, with 81% of the 1.9 million ounces within the PEA pit lying above a 330m depth. The very limited drilling below the 350m level presents significant potential to expand the Wenot deposit to depth along the full 2.5 km strike length. The deepest hole to date was 23ODD-064 which intersected multiple gold zones, with the deepest intersection of 5.18 g/t Au over 20.2 m (including 12.7 g/t Au over 7.9m) being at approximately 460m below surface.\nDrilling at Omai is expected to continue until early December at which time we expect to commence work towards an updated Mineral Resource Estimate.\nThe most recent NI 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate for the Omai property, dated May 21, 20241 includes a Wenot resource of 834,000 indicated ounces of gold grading 1.48 g/t Au and 1,614,000 inferred ounces of gold grading 1.99 g/t Au. For the adjacent Gilt Creek deposit, the NI 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate is 1,151,000 indicated ounces of gold grading 3.22 g/t Au and 665,000 inferred ounces of gold grading 3.35 g/t Au, prepared by P&E Mining Consultants Inc.\nQuality Control\nOmai maintains an internal QA/QC program to ensure sampling and analysis of all exploration work is conducted in accordance with best practices. Certified reference materials, blanks and duplicates are entered at regular intervals. Samples are sealed in plastic bags.\nSamples from the Wenot drilling were shipped to ActLabs, a certified laboratory in Georgetown Guyana, respecting the best chain of custody practices. At the laboratory, samples are dried, crushed up to 80% passing 2 mm, riffle split (250 g), and pulverized to 95% passing 105 \u03bcm, including cleaner sand. Fifty grams of pulverized material is then fire assayed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AA). Initial assays with results above 3.0 ppm gold are re-assayed using a gravimetric finish. For samples with visible gold two separate 1000g pulverized samples are prepared, with 50 grams of each fire assayed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, with assays above 3.0 ppm gold being re-assayed using a gravimetric finish. Certified reference materials and blanks meet with QA/QC specifications.\nQualified Person\nElaine Ellingham is a Qualified Person (QP) under National Instrument 43-101 \"Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects\" and has approved the technical information contained in this news release.

The Company announced a Preliminary Economic Assessment (\"PEA\") on its Wenot Deposit at Omai in April 2024, showing an open pit operation to produce 1.84 million ounces of gold over a 13-year period, with an NPV5% of US$556 million at a US$1950/oz gold price. This baseline PEA incorporates only 45% of the property's MRE and management believes that with additional work the mine plan can be significantly expanded, the economics enhanced, and the open pit resources further increased. An updated NI 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") of 2.0 million ounces of gold (Indicated) and 2.3 million ounces (Inferred) reflects a notable increase as a result of 2023's successful drilling. Once South America's largest producing gold mine, Omai produced over 3.7 million ounces of gold between 1993 and 2005. Mining ceased at a time when the average gold price was less than US$400 per ounce. As a brownfields project, Omai benefits from good road access and a wealth of historical data that provides knowledge of the geology and gold mineralization on the Property, as well as metallurgy, historical process recoveries and many other relevant mining parameters.\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nThis news release includes certain \"forward-looking statements\" under applicable Canadian securities legislation.

Bob Parker, senior advisor at International Capital Markets Association, said while talking to CNBC that the massive demand for gold from Chinese retail investors has been a major factor behind the latest rally in gold prices. The analyst said there are rumors that the Chinese government may initiate a devaluation of the yuan, and the property crisis in the country is also causing investors to buy gold. The analyst, however, noted that gold prices could see a \u201csetback\u201d soon as inflation is expected to decline.\nGold Vs Stocks\nWhether or not gold is a better investment when compared to stocks has been a topic of immense debate over the past several decades. Gold is volatile as its price depends on several factors. A report by Stonebridge Capital said that over the past 20 years, gold\u2019s returns have surpassed those of stocks, albeit with higher risks. However, when we look at gold\u2019s returns in a 50-year window, it underperformed large-cap stocks. The report also backed a common notion that gold can act as an inflation hedge, saying gold saw a \u201cdramatic\u201d rise in price during the high-inflation periods of the 1970s.\nGold\u2019s Expected Movement if the Fed Doesn\u2019t Cut Rates\nChris Gaffney, president of World Markets at EverBank, recently said during an interview with Marketwatch that upside to gold would be limited if the Fed decides to go with one rate cut or no rate cut this year. However, the analyst thinks gold could rise and outperform silver amid geopolitical triggers, especially if the conflict in Gaza expands.\nMethodology\nSince investing in gold mining stocks is one of the best ways for average investors to gain exposure to gold and commodities industry, we decided to take a look at some of the top gold mining stocks hedge funds are buying this year. For this article we first scanned Insider Monkey\u2019s proprietary database of 919 hedge funds and picked 10 gold mining stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Welcome to our weekly market wrap, where we take a look back at these last five trading days with a focus on the market news, economic data, and headlines that had the most impact on gold prices and other key correlated assets\u2014and may continue to in the future.\nGold prices are in the red for the week, but this shading elides what has been solid support for the yellow metal throughout the week and a not-insignificant rally following Monday's sell-off.\nSo, what kind of week has it been?\nGold prices have been resilient this week, as lightly attended and interrupted by the Thanksgiving holiday in the US as it was. Traders and investors would initially have braced for an ugly end to November when spot prices toppled quickly on Monday morning in the US from last week's strong close (and this week's high-water mark, barring Friday fireworks) at $2720/oz. At the close of the first US session of the week, the yellow metal had fallen to the week's nadir at $2610. The fall appeared to be driven by the same headwinds that have pummeled gold since Election Day: a strong climb in US Treasury yields and a resurgent US Dollar.\nHowever, the market found some evident support above $2600, and on Tuesday, gold had already begun to regain some ground. One certain driver of this was the Tuesday afternoon release of discussion notes and minutes taken from the most recent FOMC meeting, which painted a picture of the US central bank committed and comfortable with continuing to cut interest rates on a path to \"neutral\" in spite of recently stubborn inflation data, albeit at a gradual pace. Gold trading could have pivoted on either of the headline points here. The yellow metal would likely have sunk lower again if investors focused on the Fed's expectation for cuts to come \"gradually\" over the coming months, meaning that it will take longer for gold to potentially thrive in a truly lower rate environment. Instead, the implication that the FOMC is not giving serious consideration to pausing cuts entirely appeared the most dominant input, pushing (or at least permitting) gold spot to rise back to within touching distance of $2650/oz.\nIt should be noted, though, that this move in gold could also have been influenced by investors' and traders' expectations that the incoming US administration will apply meaningful pressure on the Fed to accelerate the path of monetary policy regardless of their stated plans today. If this is indeed a driving factor, we have to acknowledge the potential for increased volatility as gold and other assets would then continue to have a high level of sensitivity to any headlines or promises related to this developing story between now and Inauguration Day (and probably beyond.)",

(Zijin).\nThe Eriez HydroFloat test work for evaluating coarse ore flotation has demonstrated excellent results for one of the key uplift scenarios defined in the Kharmagtai Scoping Study1. It has effectively improved upfront processing efficiencies, producing a coarse reject of up to ~44% by mass for the main mineralised sulphide orebody.\nHighlights\n-\nTestwork for assessing coarser grind options (P80 grind sizes ranging between 150 to 450 microns (\u00b5m) for Kharmagtai sulphide mineralisation, using HydroFloat achieved compelling results:\n-\nUp to 94% copper and 92% gold recovered in the HydroFloat stage;\n-\nEnabling a peak coarse reject of 43.8% by mass, at 450\u00b5m; and\n-\nRougher recoveries of 91% for copper and 83% for gold, at 250 \u00b5m.\n-\n-\nCoarse ore flotation may offer numerous benefits for Kharmagtai, including:\n-\nReduced power and water intensity per tonne of ore processed;\n-\nIncreased mill capacity and overall plant capacity for an increased production rate;\n-\nReduction in consumables, such as grinding media and reagents; and\n-\nSignificant improvement in tailings stability with the production of coarser tails, as well as water recycling at the back end of the plant.\n-\n-\nHydroFloat provides the opportunity for Kharmagtai to recover valuable minerals in the 150 to 200\u00b5m range that processing through conventional flotation alone is unable to perform.\n-\nMore than 70 HydroFloat units are commercially used in global operations, including Australia. The pilot program to date has demonstrated significant potential for HydroFloat, with further mineralogy and pilot tests to be conducted as new samples become available.\nXanadu\u2019s Executive Chairman and Managing Director, Colin Moorhead said:\n\u201cThese results provide strong support for our Scoping Study uplift scenario using coarse ore flotation to improve overall project economics. This uplift is achieved through increasing throughput and accelerating mining and processing rates which ultimately accelerate revenue generation at Kharmagtai.\nIt also promises to enhance the environmental sustainability aspects of Kharmagtai through the early separation of barren material and a coarser grind size, allowing for significant reduction in power and water requirements, and better tailings management. Given this separation method has been used successfully by bulk miners for over 20 years, we intend to leverage those learnings at Kharmagtai. We are now working with DRA, our process design engineers, to determine the optimal timing to include HydroFloat in the processing flowsheet, and maximise its beneficial impact for Kharmagtai.\u201d\nCoarse Ore Flotation Metallurgical Testwork Program\nSummary\nThe existing conventional flowsheet involves crushing and grinding ore to a P80 size of 150\u00b5m for Stage 1 (15Mtpa in Scoping Study) and 212\u00b5m for Stage 2 (30Mtpa in Scoping Study)2.\nTestwork to investigate coarser grind options was completed at ALS\u2019 laboratory in Perth and was supervised by Eriez Australia using Eriez HydroFloat pilot equipment, returning HydroFloat rougher recoveries of:\n-\n91% Cu recovery and 83.2% Au recovery at 250\u00b5m; and\n-\n88.4% Cu recovery and 77.7% Au recovery at 350\u00b5m.\nDescription\nComposite samples were prepared from core drilled at each of the Stockwork Hill, White Hill and Copper Hill deposits Kharmagtai. Sample preparation consisted of combining samples \u201cas received\u201d into a single 200kg composite, crushing to 3.35mm, followed by rotary blending and splitting and then grinding individual samples to 150 (finer), 250, 350 and 450 (coarser) \u00b5m.\nEriez supplied the CrossFlow classifier (XF), rotary drum and HydroFloat (HF) units used for laboratory testing at the ALS facility. The Eriez Laboratory CrossFlow is a hydraulic classifier that separates particles according to size, shape, and specific gravity. Samples were classified in the CrossFlow to remove the fines and slimes with a target split size of 90\u00b5m and the CrossFlow underflow was used as the feed for the coarse particle flotation into the HydroFloat unit. Prior to that, the HydroFloat feed was polished and conditioned with collector reagent in a rotating drum before being pumped into the HydroFloat. The entire HydroFloat overflow and HydroFloat underflow streams were collected, split, and sub-sampled before assay analysis for primarily copper and gold. Combined CrossFlow overflow and HydroFloat overflow from the 250 and 350\u00b5m tests were tested by flotation to produce a rougher concentrate, after grinding to 75\u00b5m.\nHydroFloat Results\nThe coarse ore flotation evaluation included head grade analysis and rougher flotation recovery testwork on a composite sample taken from varying deposits, depths, sulphide and alteration types to test coarser grind options. Results for the Cross Flow (XF) stage at the tested P80 grind sizes are shown in Table 1.\nTable 1: Mass Split in Cross Flow\n| Stream | P80 450 \u00b5m | P80 350 \u00b5m | P80 250 \u00b5m | P80 150 \u00b5m |\n| XF Overflow %Wt | 36.6 | 37.6 | 44.5 | 52.9 |\n| XF Underflow %Wt | 63.4 | 62.4 | 55.5 | 47.1 |\nAs the grind size gets coarser, less fines are produced and hence the XF overflow mass reduces from 52.9% by weight at 150 \u00b5m, to 36.6% at 450 \u00b5m. In a full-scale flowsheet, the XF overflow would join the HF overflow for downstream conventional rougher and cleaner flotation.\nThe results from the HydroFloat (HF) stage are shown in Table 2. Both Cu and Au recoveries increase as the grind size becomes finer, and at the same time the HydroFloat overflow Cu and Au grades increase from 0.88% Cu to 1.24% Cu and from 0.97g/t Au to 1.70g/t Au, demonstrating improved liberation at the finer sizes. The HydroFloat underflow grade (final tailings) reduce from 0.08% Cu to 0.03% Cu and 0.08g/t Au to 0.06g/t Au as the sizing gets finer.\nTable 2: HydroFloat Recovery and Mass Pull Results\n| Stream | Parameter | P80 Grind Size | |||\n| 450\u00b5m | 350\u00b5m | 250\u00b5m | 150\u00b5m | ||\n| HF Feed | % Cu | 0.33 | 0.32 | 0.35 | 0.38 |\n| g/t Au | 0.35 | 0.25 | 0.40 | 0.54 | |\n| HF Overflow | %Wt | 30.6 | 32.1 | 33.6 | 28.9 |\n| % Cu | 0.88 | 0.88 | 0.98 | 1.24 | |\n| g/t Au | 0.86 | 0.65 | 0.98 | 1.70 | |\n| Recovery | % Cu | 82.9 | 87.3 | 92.5 | 94.4 |\n| % Au | 84.2 | 77.5 | 90.8 | 92.1 | |\n| HF Underflow | % Cu | 0.08 | 0.06 | 0.04 | 0.03 |\n| g/t Au | 0.08 | 0.09 | 0.05 | 0.06 |\nThe combined XF overflow (minus 90 \u00b5m) and the HydroFloat overflow represent the downstream feed in the process flowsheet. For each of the 250 \u00b5m and 350 \u00b5m laboratory tests, the XF and HF overflows were combined and ground to 75 \u00b5m for rougher flotation. The results of this step, plus the HydroFloat (HF) results are combined in Table 3 and compared with results from the conventional flowsheet.\nTable 3: Combined Results of HydroFloat Test Products for Rougher Flotation Compared to Standard Rougher Test\n| Product | 350\u00b5m HF Feed and | 250\u00b5m HF Feed and | Typical conventional | |||||||||\n|\n| Cu | Cu Rec | Au | Au Rec | Cu | Cu Rec | Au | Au Rec | Cu | Cu Rec | Au | Au Rec |\n| Rougher Concentrate | 6.11 | 88.4 | 4.51 | 77.7 | 5.95 | 91.0 | 4.07 | 83.2 | 4.64 | 90.1 | 4.50 | 86.4 |\n| Rougher Tailings | 0.04 | 5.5 | 0.08 | 11.4 | 0.04 | 5.4 | 0.06 | 10.8 | 0.04 | 9.9 | 0.06 | 13.6 |\n| XF Underflow | 0.06 | 6.1 | 0.09 | 10.9 | 0.04 | 3.6 | 0.05 | 6.0 | - | - | - | - |\nThese results demonstrate that the 250 \u00b5m HydroFloat test, followed by a 75 \u00b5m grind for rougher flotation, produced similar results to a conventional flotation test at 150 \u00b5m. Furthermore, improved rougher concentrate grade and recovery were achieved:\n-\n5.95% Cu grade and 91.0% recovery for HydroFloat, versus\n-\n4.64% Cu grade and 90.1% recovery for conventional flotation.\nHowever, Au grade and recovery are both less favourable for HydroFloat versus conventional flotation.\nResults indicate that use of Eriez HydroFloat for Kharmagtai ore achieved a high recovery while rejecting coarse, barren ore.\nSignificance to Kharmagtai\nThe results achieved in these preliminary tests provide sufficient encouragement to conduct further studies. Since the comminution circuit is the major source of energy consumption, investigating ways to reduce this through a coarser grind warrants further work. This will take the form of mineralogical studies to determine the liberation of sulphides at coarse grinds, followed by further pilot testing on new samples, as they become available.\nFigure 1: Eriez 6\u201d Laboratory HydroFloat Setup\nSample Selection and Preparation\nMetallurgical sample locations, zones and assayed head grades are detailed in Table 3.

The comprehensive metallurgy program during the Pre-Feasibility Study includes comminution properties of the mineralisation and alteration styles at Kharmagtai to determine the optimum flowsheet and generate inputs for engineering design. This will also generate data to inform the copper and gold recovery models, and allow operating costs estimates to be calculated. Concentrate samples will also be generated for marketing studies as part of the broader metallurgy program.\nAbout Xanadu Mines\nXanadu is an ASX and TSX listed Exploration company operating in Mongolia.

The spot price of the metal soared 13% last year, and there's speculation that it will continue to remain in demand in 2024 -- perhaps even setting a new high.\nBut what's the best route to add some glitter to your portfolio? Sure, visiting the local coin gallery and buying gold bullion is one option. However, AgnicoEagle Mines(NYSE: AEM)Franco-Nevada(NYSE: FNV), and Newmont(NYSE: NEM) are three gold stocks that provide even better opportunities for gold bugs in the new year.\n1. Agnico Eagle\nAgnico Eagle is a gold-mining stock that outshines many of its peers with its mines in North America, Finland, and Australia. After its 2022 merger with Kirkland Lake Gold and its acquisition of Yamana's Canadian assets, Agnico has emerged as a leading producer of gold -- and profits. Compared to Barrick Gold and GoldFields, two of its leading peers based on market cap, it distinguishes itself with strong free cash flow.\nThis helps provide the ability to acquire more assets or to advance growth projects that will expand its mineral resources and strengthen the company's future.\nThe strong free cash flow has also helped the company to remain in sound financial health -- something that's not always the case with mining companies, which require large amounts of capital to develop their assets. At the end of 2023's third quarter, Agnico had an investment-grade balance sheet and a conservative ratio of 0.36 in net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA).\nCurrently, investors can grab shares of Agnico Eagle from the bargain bin. The stock sells for about 11.2 times operating cash flow, a discount to its five-year average cash-flow multiple of 13.5.\n2. Franco-Nevada\nUnlike mining companies that dig gold out of the ground, Franco-Nevada is a royalty and streaming company. More like specialized financiers, royalty and streaming companies provide up-front capital to miners to help them finance their capital-intensive projects. In return, they receive the right to acquire future mineral production for a set price (usually lower than the current market price) or to receive a portion of the mined minerals.\nBecause of this business model, Franco-Nevada provides gold investors with an investment opportunity that has less risk than the mining companies that must execute on the development of the assets.\nWhile Franco-Nevada has exposure to other metals as well as oil and gas, its gold represents the lion's share of the company's revenue: 78% as of last year's third quarter. And the company has partnerships with some of the leading gold mining companies, including Barrick, Newmont, Agnico Eagle, and Kinross Gold.\nFurther evidence of Franco-Nevada's appeal for conservative investors comes from the stock's rock-solid balance sheet that features zero debt and $1.3 billion in cash.\n3. Newmont\nNewmont, with a history stretching back over a century, is the largest gold-mining stock based on market capitalization, and it's the only gold producer included in the S&P 500.\nThe company appears a lot more attractive now since it closed on its acquisition of Newcrest in November. Newmont expects the transaction to immediately add value, projecting that it will achieve $500 million in pre-tax synergies in the two years following the closing of the deal as well as a minimum of $2 billion in cash improvements through portfolio optimization during the same period.\nOne of the especially alluring qualities of Newmont is its attention to rewarding shareholders. The company has a unique dividend policy among gold stocks in that it distributes a fixed dividend of $1 per share (at a gold price of at least $1,400 per ounce) and a variable dividend based on the company's free cash flow.\nCurrently, Newmont's stock offers a juicy 4% forward-yielding dividend. And those concerned about whether the company is jeopardizing its financial health to appease investors can rest assured thanks to the company's conservative approach to leverage. At the end of Q3 2023, Newmont had a net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 0.7 -- below the company's targeted ratio of 1.\nWhich gold stock is the best addition to your portfolio?\nThe most conservative investors yearning for gold exposure will find that Franco-Nevada is probably their best bet thanks to its debt-free balance sheet and a business model that represents a lower risk profile than other gold stocks.\nFor those comfortable with a higher degree of risk, however, Agnico Eagle and Newmont both offer great propositions -- especially Newmont, with its compelling dividend policy.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Newmont right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Newmont, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Newmont wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

This isn\u2019t new.

        "full_text": "Key Takeaways\n-\nThough robust gains across many risk assets in 2023 came as a relief following a bleak 2022, we can't help but wonder if markets are failing to see the forest for the trees.\n-\nCurrent market dynamics imply unwarranted levels of optimism about benign outcomes to the key risks facing investors, including the uncertain economic landing, ongoing fiscal profligacy and geopolitical discord.\n-\nLast year's equity performance did nothing to recalibrate the yawning valuation gaps between investment styles and geographies, and both value and non-US stocks continue to trade at historically cheap relative valuations.\nAs it had for much of 2023, the performance of risk assets in the fourth quarter appeared to ebb and flow with the market's expectations of Fed policy.\nWhile the higher for longer sentiment that dominated the third quarter persisted into the fourth perpetuating a selloff in Treasuries and broad weakness in stocksoptimism that a soft landing and series of rate cuts were just over the horizon appeared to take root in late October. The renewal of dovish sentiment, which was reinforced by macroeconomic readings and Fed rhetoric in the weeks that followed, fueled a furious rally across a wide range of assets through the balance of the year. Notably, market breadth widened in conjunction with this surge, unlike earlier rallies concentrated in a small subset of very large technology-related names. The S&P 500 Index returned 11.7% for the fourth quarter and 26.3% for the year, while the MSCI World Index returned a respective 11.4% and 23.8%.1 Growth outpaced value during the quarter and very significantly outperformed for the year.\nWhile market returns in 2023 were a welcome respite from a dismal 2022, the buoyant conditions entering the new year make us wonder if hope has gotten the better of substance.\nMounting Risks Go Unheeded in 2023\nWe believe the investment environment today is rife with challenges, the escalation of which could shake markets from their apparent complacency and inspire a newfound sense of risk aversion, to the detriment of many financial assets.\nFor example, current market valuations suggest markets are complacent about the inevitability of a soft landing even as any sort of landing remains elusive; in our view, the risk of an adverse outcome only increases the longer the Fed circles the runway without touching down. We have long been skeptical of the central bank's ability to achieve a soft landing and remain so today. Beyond the scarcity of previous successful attempts, the continued strength of the domestic labor market makes it hard for us to envision a scenario in which wage growth spontaneously returns to a level consistent with target-level inflation absent a meaningful increase in unemployment.\nBroadly speaking, wage growth reflects two variables: the rate of change in nonfarm payrolls and their overall level. While the rate of payroll additions has moderated, the economy has continued to add jobs at a steady clip since bottoming in April 2020 and the level of payrolls as a percentage of the total population stands near a post-financial crisis high. Not surprisingly, wage growth has been far less responsive to Fed tightening than broad inflation metrics; though off its cyclical peak, the Atlanta Fed Wage Growth Trackerat 5.2% in its latest readingcontinues to reflect a pace not seen since 2001.2 Previous episodes of wage growth at or near the current rate were reined in only when exceeded by two-year Treasury yields for a period of time; higher for longerand the economic slowing and job losses likely to accompany itmay be a necessity if the labor markets don't begin to demonstrate some slack.\nWe're also concerned about the unsustainable fiscal trajectory of the US and other advanced economies, as public debt balances continue to swell with no sign of the spending discipline necessary to rein them in. Financial repression via unconventional monetary policies through much of this century kept interest rates artificially low and tempered interest expenses even as debt balances continued to rise, but the rollback of crisis-era monetary accommodations has altered the calculus of government borrowing. We've yet to see indications that fiscal policy will be adjusted to reflect the new math anytime soon, however. In fact, continued deficit spending by the US during 2023 served as a stimulative impulse at odds with the Fed's monetary policy goals, perhaps accounting for the economy's apparent resilience despite a surge in the cost of capital. While a path toward meaningful long-term fiscal reform seems nearly incomprehensible at this point given the fractured political landscape, even minor spending decisions may weigh heavily on the near-term path of the economy and markets. A small amount of fiscal tightening in 2024 likely would raise the odds of a hard landing, for instance; but maintaining fiscal settings at current levels could open the door to renewed inflation or stagflation. Neither outcome is particularly good for risk-asset valuations.\nDespite these hazards, the term premium on US Treasuries trended lower following the global financial crisis and spent much of the past five-plus years in negative territory. The lack of a persistently positive term premium suggests markets may not agree with our assessment of the risksor, at the very least, they have grown complacent amid the many potential triggers for a re-rating of US Treasuries. And while we can't speculate about what may finally cause investors to demand meaningful premia for the uncertain long-term fiscal trajectory of issuers, we note that changes in sentiment can happen quickly and reverberate broadly across markets.\nMacroeconomic risks have been further complicated by a new geopolitical theater of uncertainty. The liberal democratic ideals that the globalization trends of the late twentieth/early twenty-first centuries were expected to promote in many cases have been rejected in favor of autocracy. One result has been a loose coalition of authoritarian countries like China, Russia, North Korea and Iran, a heartland axis that control a vast, near-contiguous swath of land rich with natural resources across Eurasia and into the Middle East and northern Africa.\nIn recent years, this group has increased the volume and scope of its military adventurism, both directly and via proxies, and appears to have forged tighter relations as a result of a shared distaste for the liberal democracies scattered across the globe's periphery (North and South America, Western Europe, Oceana and parts of East Asia). At a minimum, these new alliances set the stage for greater friction in economic relations, and there are many ways in which current localized armed conflicts such as Ukraine/Russia and Israel/Hamas could escalate into something more far-reaching. Meanwhile, China's reputed intentions in Taiwan remain vexing to diplomats and investors alike.\nValuation of Growth Stocks and US Stocks Appear Stretched\nLast year's performance did nothing to recalibrate the yawning valuation gaps for value stocks or non-US stocks, and both continue to trade at historically cheap valuations. The Russell 1000 Value Index, for example, is about as cheap relative to its growth counterpart as it has been in many decades.3 This spread also may suggest that the old-economy businesses commonly associated with value indexes are pricing in a more sluggish economic reality than what is implied by valuations in the new-economy-biased growth universe. Ironically, it's possible this old-economy discount could serve as a potential shield against adverse developments while also promoting valuation elasticity to more positive economic outcomes.\nGold also remains undervalued relative to equities. The metal has ably played its role as a potential hedge against adverse events in recent years despite the headwind of rising real interest rates. After sinking to seven-month lows on the back of hawkish Fed sentiment, the price of gold surged in early October as Hamas' attack on Israel introduced a dangerous new variable to the already fraught geopolitical environment. With a constellation of other factors beyond its value as a perceived safe haven in uncertain times subsequently aligning in support of gold pricesincreasing Fed dovishness, easing nominal and real interest rates, and a weakening US dollar, among themthe metal continued its climb over the balance of 2023 and ultimately established a new all-time nominal high around $2,078 per ounce in late December.4\nPrepared for Less Than Perfect\nThough financial markets generally appear unconcerned with the challenges we see here early in the new year, we believe it's quite possible that risk aversion will at some point be higher than it is today. Though we wouldn't hazard a guess as to when that may be, owning a range of quality businesses with track records of consistent cash flow generation and wise capital allocation may be the least-bad option in such an environment. While even high-quality companies are unlikely to avoid losses in the event of worst-case scenarios, they should prove resilient and potentially be well-positioned to outperform once crisis recedes. Meanwhile, durable companies should also comport themselves well through less-extreme outcomes, like sluggish growth or stagflation.\n1. Source: FactSet; data as of December 31, 2023.2.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Eldorado Gold Corporation (NYSE:EGO) stands against the other cheap gold stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\nGold has been on an impressive rally in 2024, positioning itself as one of the best-performing assets of the year. This surge is largely driven by various macroeconomic factors, including central bank policies and geopolitical uncertainty. According to a report by Reuters, major banks expect the gold bull run to extend into 2025 due to a combination of strong physical demand from China and substantial inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs). J.P. Morgan analysts noted that the revival of large ETF inflows, which had been absent since April 2022, is crucial for sustaining the rally. The U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s recent decision to initiate a rate-cutting cycle is also expected to provide additional momentum for gold prices.\nSo far this year, gold has gained over 27%, or nearly $570 per ounce, and recently hit a record high of $2,639.95 per ounce. This marks its highest annual rise since 2010 and a stark outperformance compared to major stock indices. UBS analysts believe that despite these gains, gold has more room to grow over the next 6 to 12 months. They attribute this optimism to the Fed\u2019s ongoing interest rate cuts and the upcoming U.S. presidential election, which could increase market volatility and further drive investors toward safe-haven assets like gold.\nA second report from Goldman Sachs Research supports this bullish outlook, forecasting gold prices to reach $2,700 by early 2025. Strategists point to several factors that could push the precious metal to new heights. Firstly, central bank purchases of gold have accelerated since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, as these institutions seek to diversify away from the U.S. dollar and mitigate the risks posed by potential U.S. financial sanctions. The bank also highlights that gold is currently their preferred near-term long position due to its potential as a hedge against financial and geopolitical risks.\nIn addition, strategists believe that further Fed rate cuts will likely bring Western investors back into the gold market, which has seen relatively lower participation from this group during the recent rally. Another key driver could be geopolitical shocks, such as additional tariffs or heightened debt concerns in the United States. Should the U.S. debt burden continue to rise, it could lead to increased credit-default swap spreads, enhancing gold\u2019s appeal as a safe-haven asset.\nThe strong outlook for gold is echoed by various financial institutions, with several projecting prices to continue climbing over the next few years. ANZ anticipates gold to reach $2,805 by the end of 2025, while BofA sees the potential for prices to touch $3,000 per ounce. Similarly, Macquarie expects gold to hit a peak of $2,600 per ounce in Q1 2025, with a possible spike toward $3,000. Citi Research\u2019s baseline projection ranges between $2,800 and $3,000 per ounce by 2025.\nGiven these forecasts, investors are increasingly looking at gold as a reliable investment option in the current uncertain economic environment. The continued interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve, coupled with strong physical demand and robust ETF inflows, create a favorable backdrop for further appreciation in gold prices. Consequently, several hedge funds have started accumulating positions in gold mining stocks, viewing them as a cost-effective way to gain exposure to the precious metal\u2019s rally.\nIn this article, we explore eight cheap gold stocks to buy according to hedge funds. These stocks offer investors an opportunity to benefit from the anticipated gold bull market at relatively lower prices. With solid financials and potential for significant upside, these gold stocks could be attractive additions to any portfolio looking to capitalize on the ongoing surge in gold prices.\nOur Methodology\nFor this article, we utilized the Finviz stock screener to identify stocks within the gold industry that have forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios below 15 as of September 29. From this initial list, we focused on eight stocks that are most favored by institutional investors. These stocks were then ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them as of Q2 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nAerial view of a large open-pit gold mine with a fleet of mining trucks in the foreground.\nEldorado Gold Corporation (NYSE:EGO), headquartered in Vancouver, Canada, is a leading mining company involved in the exploration, development, and sale of mineral products, primarily gold, across Turkey, Canada, Greece, and Romania. With a robust portfolio that includes a 100% interest in the Kisladag and Efem\u00e7ukuru mines in Turkey, the Lamaque complex in Canada, and multiple gold mines in Greece, Eldorado Gold Corporation (NYSE:EGO) is well-positioned for growth. As of Q2 2024, the company reported a notable increase in hedge fund interest, with 19 hedge fund holders compared to just 12 in the previous quarter, signaling growing confidence in the company\u2019s fundamentals.\nIn Q2 2024, Eldorado Gold Corporation (NYSE:EGO) achieved a gold production of 122,319 ounces, aligning with its guidance of 505,000 to 555,000 ounces for the year. The increase in production was aided by improved grades at key sites, including Lamaque and Kisladag, demonstrating the effectiveness of the company\u2019s operational strategies. Despite some production disruptions due to labor negotiations, Eldorado expects to ramp up production in the latter half of the year, reinforcing its positive outlook.\nFinancially, Eldorado Gold Corporation (NYSE:EGO) reported net earnings of approximately $56 million, or $0.28 per share, driven by higher sales volumes and gold prices. Adjusted net earnings were even more impressive at $66.6 million, reflecting a strong operational performance. The company\u2019s total cash costs stood at $940 per ounce sold, with all-in sustaining costs at $1,331 per ounce, both of which are consistent with annual guidance. While costs increased due to rising royalties and labor expenses, they remain manageable in the context of higher gold prices, which should bolster revenue moving forward.\nEldorado Gold Corporation (NYSE:EGO) maintains a solid liquidity position with $810 million in total liquidity, including $595 million in cash. This financial strength enables the company to support its growth initiatives, including significant capital investments in the Skouries project, which are expected to accelerate in the coming quarters. Overall, Eldorado Gold Corporation (NYSE:EGO) strategic positioning, operational efficiency, and robust financial metrics make it a compelling investment opportunity within the gold sector, particularly as hedge funds continue to show increased interest.\nOverall EGO ranks 3rd on our list of cheap gold stocks to buy according to hedge funds.

For many, high housing expenses are draining disposable income, making debt payments harder to manage.\nAccording to Bank of America's analysis, 26% of households live paycheck to paycheck based on necessary spending. This figure underscores the disparity, as necessity spending eats up nearly all income for some families, an uptick from previous years.\nHigher-income families aren't immune to these pressures. Roughly 20% of those earning over $150,000 struggle to stay afloat. Despite a strong job market, rising prices have diluted wage gains for many. Sarah Foster from Bankrate noted that, based on a Bankrate poll, six in 10 Americans feel like the economy is in a recession.\nTrending: Can you guess how many retire with a $5,000,000 nest egg? The percentage may shock you.\nU.S. Bank's chief economist Beth Ann Bovino emphasizes that lower-income families, who often dedicate over 20% of their income to debt, are especially vulnerable compared to wealthier households with higher savings and investments.\nDebt management has become a sticking point. According to a New York Fed report on the first quarter of the year, one-third of individuals with maxed-out credit cards have gone delinquent \u2013 a troubling rise compared to pre-pandemic levels. With interest rates high, financing costs for essentials like car loans or home improvements are pushing monthly budgets to the brink.",

That ought to double sector unit profits, extending gold stocks\u2019 long trend of massive earnings growth. Such fantastic results should increasingly catch fund investors\u2019 attention, with their inflows driving this sector way higher.\nGold stocks remain out of favor, greatly lagging gold\u2019s monster upleg over this past year. This has proven one of gold\u2019s mightiest advances in many years, soaring 46.8% over 11.7 months! Historically larger gold miners dominating the leading GDX gold-stock ETF have seen their stock prices amplify gold uplegs by 2x to 3x. Yet instead of seeing normal 95%- to-140% upleg gains, GDX has merely rallied 60.7% at best!\nThat very-poor 1.3x upside leverage to gold has been a real kick in the teeth for contrarian speculators and investors. Gold stocks need to way outperform their metal to compensate for the big additional operational, geological, and geopolitical risks they heap on top of gold price trends. Yet so far that sure hasn\u2019t happened in this upleg, leaving traders increasingly disappointed with this lucrative high-potential sector.\nTwo major factors contributed to this surprising anomaly. First gold-stock sentiment was crushed in mid-2022 and hasn\u2019t recovered. Then the Fed\u2019s most-violent rate-hike cycle ever catapulted the US Dollar Index up an incredible 16.7% in 6.0 months to an extreme 20.4-year secular peak! That spawned colossal gold-futures selling, slamming gold 20.9% lower in 6.6 months. GDX cratered a brutal 46.5% during that!\nSecond while gold blasted up 26.4% year-to-date, traders have been overwhelmingly distracted by the AI stock bubble. While gold achieved 35 nominal-record closing highs so far this year, the S&P 500 bested that with a whopping 44 of its own! Gold and gold stocks are alternative investments, thriving the most when general stock markets grind lower. Instead they\u2019ve been surging, spinning off vast greed and euphoria.\nBut sooner or later all that will pass, and gold stocks will be bid way higher to reflect these lofty prevailing gold prices. The gold miners\u2019 phenomenal fundamentals overwhelmingly support this bullish thesis. For 33 quarters in a row now, I\u2019ve painstakingly analyzed the latest results reported by GDX\u2019s 25-biggest component stocks. Right after each quarterly earnings season, I write essays explaining how they are performing.\nAcross individual gold miners, there are always plenty of distorted bottom-line earnings. These include big noncash gains and losses arising from unusual items ranging from acquisitions to impairment charges. But that noise can be distilled out with an excellent proxy for sector unit profits. It simply averages the GDX top 25\u2019s all-in sustaining costs in any quarter, then subtracts them from its average gold price.\nThese implied per-ounce profits have been skyrocketing, leaving gold stocks deeply undervalued relative to their metal. A year ago in Q3\u201923, the GDX top 25 reported $622 in unit earnings which soared 94% YoY. Then in Q4\u201923, those grew again to $659 per ounce which shot up another 42% YoY. That trend persisted in Q1\u201924, with these major gold miners averaging earning $795 per ounce which powered up 35% YoY.\nThen all that accelerated dramatically in the spectacular Q2\u201924, which I analyzed in depth in a mid-August essay. That quarter\u2019s record average gold price of $2,337 combined with GDX-top-25 AISCs plunging 10.2% YoY to $1,239 catapulted unit earnings to a dazzling record $1,099! That blasted up another 84% YoY. So miners\u2019 last four reported quarters have seen per-ounce profits soar 94%, 42%, 35%, and 84% YoY!\nSuch explosive profits growth has naturally slammed gold miners\u2019 price-to-earnings ratios dramatically lower, into the teens and even single digits in some cases. With fantastically-bullish fundamentals like this, you\u2019d think traders would be rushing into this high-potential sector. But gold stocks remain mired in apathy, lost in the shadow of this crazy AI stock bubble stealing all the limelight. Yet its days are numbered.\nEventually, stock prices always mean revert to some reasonable multiple of underlying corporate earnings. Market-darling AI stocks can\u2019t trade with 60x+ P/Es indefinitely, and good gold stocks can\u2019t remain at sub-15x multiples. Sooner or later some catalyst will spark overdue capital flows to start normalizing all this. It could be the AI stock bubble finally bursting and decisively rolling over, it could prove gold surging even higher.\nBut maybe the gold miners will stack enough sensational earnings seasons to convince fund managers to return. Their relatively-big buying in this relatively-small sector will drive stock prices way higher, which will eventually fuel greed, euphoria, and maybe even a popular speculative mania. Gold stocks are about to report absolutely-epic Q3 results, their best ever achieved by far! That could prove this sector\u2019s tipping point.\nQ3\u201924\u2019s average gold price soared an amazing 28.6% YoY to a new all-time record $2,477! This is utterly stunning considering just a year ago that highwater mark had been $1,978. Gold\u2019s phenomenal prices last quarter were fueled by major buying from gold-futures speculators, central banks around the world, Chinese investors, and a huge surge in Indian gold imports. I could write entire essays discussing each.\nBut today realize Q3\u2019s record gold levels have been set in stone, they can\u2019t be revised lower like Biden Administration jobs reports. So the only variable driving sector unit profitability is the GDX top 25\u2019s average all-in sustaining costs. Over the past four quarters they have been trending lower on balance, clocking in at $1,304, $1,317, $1,277, and $1,239 per ounce. That averages $1,284, a conservative baseline.\nThe majority of these elite major gold miners provide and update AISC guidance throughout the year. And many of them are forecasting higher production and thus lower mining costs in H2\u201924 compared to H1. Gold mining has massive fixed costs, which growing output spreads across more ounces reducing unit costs. A surprising number of major gold miners continued guiding to considerably-lower costs in Q3 and Q4.\nThe world\u2019s largest gold miner and GDX\u2019s biggest component by far with a huge 14.6% weighting is a great example. In Q1 and Q2, Newmont reported AISCs of $1,439 and $1,562 per ounce. That averaged a little over $1,500 in H1. Yet in late July NEM reaffirmed its full-year-2024 AISC guidance at just $1,400 per ounce. Unlike most of its peers, Newmont didn\u2019t even give a range. And its 2024 output was H2-weighted.\nBack in late February this super-major forecast 47% of this year\u2019s production would come in H1, then 53% in H2. That alone is going to force AISCs lower. To hit that $1,400 AISC target for all of 2024, Q3\u2019s and Q4\u2019s would have to average just $1,300! That is sharply lower from Q1\u2019s and Q2\u2019s, and would make for a big improvement. We are talking about H2 AISCs plunging 13%+ from H1 levels, which would be amazing.\nWhile I really doubt NEM will achieve such low Q3 and Q4 AISCs, they will definitely materially improve. And there are plenty of other GDX-top-25 majors with similar much-better-mining-cost forecasts for H2 compared to H1. Collectively these elite gold miners averaged $1,258 AISCs in H1\u201924. It seems pretty conservative to imagine them improving 2%ish in this soon-to-be-reported Q3, which would be near $1,230.\nWe won\u2019t know what the actual average is until Q3 earnings season ends in mid-November, after which I\u2019ll write another essay fully analyzing those collective results. But if GDX-top-25 AISCs come in around $1,230, subtracted from Q3\u2019s phenomenal $2,477 average gold price that yields implied sector profits of $1,247 per ounce! That would crush Q2\u201924\u2019s previous record of $1,099, and skyrocket over 100% YoY!\nYou\u2019d sure think a doubling in gold miners\u2019 already-massive profits would impress some fund managers, motivating them to add gold-stock positions. But even if GDX-top-25 Q3 AISCs come in way higher for some reason, profitability is still going to soar. Even if those average AISCs prove much worse up near $1,350, Q3\u2019s unit earnings would still soar 81% YoY to a new record $1,127. Those profits will prove epic.\nCrazily due to this AI stock bubble and funds dangerously concentrated in a handful of wildly-overcrowded AI plays, American stock investors\u2019 overall allocations to gold are effectively zero. Entering October, the S&P 500 stocks collectively commanded a staggering $51,247b market capitalization. Yet the combined holdings of the world-dominant American GLD and IAU gold ETFs were merely worth $106b that same day.\nThat implies a trivial 0.2% gold allocation, despite gold\u2019s record-shattering year! That should be 5% to 10%, since gold has always been an essential portfolio diversifier. Even if it grows to 1%, gold is heading way higher. And fund managers\u2019 allocations to gold miners\u2019 stocks are similarly-tiny. At some point gold miners\u2019 earnings will grow so fat and rich that their stocks can no longer be ignored, and capital inflows will soar.\nWhile the major gold stocks\u2019 imminent Q3 results are going to be jaw-droppingly awesome, this sector does face a near-term speedbump. Gold stocks leverage gold, and it faces high selloff risks during coming weeks. My essay last week analyzed this in depth. Gold simply blasted too far too fast to extremely-overbought levels driven by heavy gold-futures buying, leaving speculators\u2019 positioning extreme.\nBut despite gold growing really overextended, gold stocks are not since they have lagged their metal so much this year. This chart divides GDX by its own 200-day moving average, creating an overbought-and-oversold indicator I call the Relative GDX. This renders gold-stock moves in constant-percentage terms around a 200dma flattened to horizontal at 1.00x. Over time this rGDX indicator tends to form trading ranges.\nThe current one based on the last five years of data runs from extremely-oversold levels under 0.75x GDX\u2019s 200dma to extremely-overbought ones over 1.30x. Unlike its metal, GDX still hasn\u2019t yet reached the latter warning levels in this year-long upleg! At the major gold stocks\u2019 latest interim high achieved in late September, the rGDX was merely running 1.249x! Gold stocks don\u2019t need to fully amplify gold\u2019s selloff.\nOf course they will to some extent, as they are leveraged plays on the metal they mine. At worst since its latest interim high, gold has pulled back 2.4% as of midweek. GDX did fall 6.8% in that span, making for 2.9x downside leverage on the higher side of that usual 2x-to-3x range. But that ought to moderate since gold stocks remain really undervalued after seriously lagging gold\u2019s powerful advance, as precedent shows.\nGold\u2019s last healthy mid-upleg pullback ran from late May to early June, when it dropped 5.7% rebalancing sentiment. During that span gold bled off excessive greed, GDX only retreated 10.0% making for mere 1.8x downside leverage! Any coming gold-stock downside on another gold pullback should prove relatively-muted as well. The gold stocks never challenged extreme overboughtness, and popular greed never flared.\nIf gold pulling back forces a gold-stock selloff ahead of or into Q3 earnings, that should prove an excellent buying opportunity. Mid-upleg pullbacks offer the best buy-relatively-low opportunities within ongoing bull-market uplegs. We ratcheted up trailing stop losses on our newsletter gold-stock trades preparing for a retreat, and I\u2019m researching fundamentally-superior mid-tiers and juniors to buy into as it runs its course.\nEven with this sector still languishing out of favor, the getting has been good. As of the end of Q3, our two newsletters have realized 54 gold-stock trades so far in 2024. Their average annualized realized gains including all losers are running +31.1%! Over the past quarter-century we\u2019ve run through 1,531 newsletter stock trades averaging 16.0% annualized realized gains, doubling the long-term stock-market average!\nSo if you\u2019re a speculator and not trading gold stocks, you\u2019re missing out on a volatile sector with lots of opportunities. And if you\u2019re an investor not yet diversified into gold stocks, you\u2019re forgoing huge upside as gold continues powering higher on balance. Gold and its miners\u2019 stocks should be included to some reasonable extent in every portfolio, as they can increase returns while lowering overall portfolio risks.\nThe bottom line is gold miners are about to start reporting epic Q3 results. Last quarter\u2019s dazzling record gold prices combined with forecast lower mining costs will catapult unit earnings to astounding levels. They are likely to about double to amazing records, extending gold stocks\u2019 massive-earnings-growth streak to five consecutive quarters. That should increasingly attract fund managers to this long-neglected sector.\nWhile gold faces a healthy rebalancing selloff after getting extremely overbought on excessive gold-futures buying, resulting short-term gold-stock selling should prove muted. This sector remains deeply-undervalued after seriously lagging gold this year, limiting gold stocks\u2019 downside leverage to gold. Any selling is an opportunity to add gold-stock positions relatively-low, before this sector soars to reflect lofty gold levels.",

Gox exchange.\nMarket participants argue the ETFs from titans including BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments offer the type of bedrock demand that can temper price swings. The six-month-old portfolios have amassed about $51 billion in assets \u2014 more than 4% of Bitcoin supply \u2014 and feature hedge funds and wealth advisers as top holders. Such specialist institutions are a contrast to the individual investors lured to crypto in earlier years as a get-rich-quick trade.\n\u201cThe increasing institutionalization of Bitcoin ownership will, over time, lead to decreasing volatility,\u201d said Richard Galvin, co-founder of hedge fund DACM. Products like ETFs introduce a category of investor that is \u201cmore likely to undertake counter-cyclical buying,\u201d he added.\nDeclining Trend\nGauges of Bitcoin swings have already trended lower in the past decade, though they remain higher than for assets such as stocks or gold. For example, the gap between 180-day measures of realized volatility for the token and the yellow metal has narrowed by over 100 percentage points during the period to 28 percentage points.\n\u201cWhenever the gold price falls, there are many value buyers such as bullion dealers, jewelers and central banks, who buy the dip enthusiastically,\u201d said Charlie Morris, chief investment officer at ByteTree Asset Management. \u201cThese value buyers naturally help to quash volatility. With early institutional adoption, Bitcoin has seen growth in value buyers.\u201d\nThe token still periodically traverses wide price spans during a trading day \u2014 so-called range-based realized volatility \u2014 and that may spur a perception of Bitcoin as considerably more skittish overall than other assets, according to a study posted on the CFA Institute\u2019s Enterprising Investor forum.\n\u201cWe\u2019re a long way from Bitcoin\u2019s volatility dropping to a level where it loses its appeal to traders,\u201d said Caroline Mauron, co-founder of digital-asset derivatives liquidity provider Orbit Markets. \u201cIts volatility is still higher than almost any traditional asset.\u201d\nSmaller Tokens\nSpeculators craving intense price swings also have a plethora of other digital coins to choose from, ranging from tokens such as Solana to meme-crowd favorite Dogecoin. Bitcoin comprises 50% of the $2.2 trillion crypto market, down from 90% a decade ago, reflecting the rise of smaller cryptoassets, CoinGecko data show.\nBitcoin hit a record of $73,798 in March, aided by the US ETFs, before falling back. Other effects of the ETFs include improved market liquidity and more clustering of trading around US market hours, research firm Kaiko said. Bitcoin funds listed in Hong Kong and Australia after the US offerings went live.\nLe Shi, head of trading at market making firm Auros, argued that an expanding deck of Bitcoin ETFs creates a \u201cnatural upward pressure\u201d on the token\u2019s price. \u201cAs the asset class grows larger and the price rises, volatility tends to decrease because it becomes harder to significantly move the price,\u201d Shi said.\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "full_text": "In September, inflation came in higher than expected, leading to some caution among policymakers. A cautious Fed tone is bearish for gold prices as it could mean a slow and gradual rate-cutting cycle.\nIn October, economists expect monthly US CPI figures to match the previous month\u2019s. Therefore, the core CPI might increase by 0.3% while the CPI by 0.2%. Meanwhile, the annual figure might increase by 2.6%, compared to September\u2019s 2.4% increase.\nGold Fundamental Analysis\nGold has collapsed in the past few days as Treasury yields soared after Trump\u2019s election win. His win has changed the outlook for the US economy and inflation. Notably, Trump\u2019s policy changes aim to boost the US economy, translating to higher inflation. A spike in inflation might stop the Fed from cutting borrowing costs, hurting gold prices.\nGold loses its appeal when interest rates are high. Therefore, demand drops and prices decline. Already, markets are repricing expected rate cuts for 2025. The Fed might cut rates less than previously expected. Market participants are now waiting to see whether the Fed will cut rates in December. This will largely depend on October inflation figures.\nIf inflation is higher than expected, rate-cut expectations will drop, and gold will collapse to new lows. On the other hand, the yellow metal will rebound if inflation is softer than expected. Such an outcome would solidify bets for a December rate cut. Currently, traders are pricing a 69% chance of a rate cut in December.\nGold Technical Analysis\nOn the technical side, gold is on a developed downtrend on the 4-hour chart. The trend recently reversed when the price reached a new peak. Although bulls made a higher high, the RSI made a lower one, indicating fading momentum.\nAfter that, bears made a series of strong candles that broke below the 22-SMA support and retested it before dropping further. At the same time, the RSI dipped into bearish territory below 50, signaling solid momentum. Since then, the price has made impulsive moves to new lows, with corrective moves pausing at the 22-SMA resistance.\nRecently, gold broke below the 2650.69 support level, strengthening the bearish bias. However, the new impulsive move has met a strong hurdle at 2600.15. Price action near this level shows indecision since the candles have made many wicks.\nTherefore, traders are likely waiting for a catalyst to decide whether to buy or sell. If inflation is higher than expected, the price might gain enough momentum to breach the support level. On the other hand, if inflation misses forecasts, gold will rebound to retest the 22-SMA or the 2650.69. Nevertheless, given the solid bearish bias, the price might eventually drop to the 2550.36 support level.",

(\u201cG2\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSXV: GTWO; OTCQX: GUYGF) is pleased to announce an updated Mineral Resource Estimate (\u201cMRE\u201d or \u201cResource\u201d) within the Company\u2019s 27,719-acre OKO project, Guyana. The updated MRE is comprised of a discrete high-grade resource for the Oko Main Zone (OMZ) and a disseminated bulk mineable resource for the Ghanie Zone.

We will continue to aggressively explore the Oko to Aremu trend and anticipate an updated resource in Q4.\u201d\nGhanie Zone Maiden MRE\nThis Maiden Mineral Resource Estimate at Ghanie signifies a major shift towards realising the district-scale nature of the OKO gold system. The Ghanie Zone represents a disseminated bulk mineable and open-pittable deposit which strongly complements the adjacent high-grade underground deposit at the OMZ.\nGhanie South (GS), Central (GC), and North (GN) all remain open with substantial depth potential. A recent high-grade discovery at Ghanie North (GDD-93) returned 24.5m @ 5.3 g/t Au from 124 metres downhole (including 4.5m @ 25.2 g/t Au from 134.5m). This intercept is indicative of additional near surface mineralization and there is much evidence to suggest the potential for further zones to be discovered along the 1.75-kilometre strike.\nOMZ Updated MRE\nSince April 2022, the Oko Main Zone (OMZ) has been further defined with additional Indicated resources confirmed. The OMZ is characterised by shear vein hosted mineralization with spectacularly high grade. Notably, the Shear 5 Indicated Underground Resource averages 15.78 g/t Au. The Resource at the OMZ has been diluted to a minimum mining width of 2 metres.\nExploration Update\nThe Company\u2019s geological model is evolving and becoming more predictive, leading to regular discoveries along the 20-kilometre-long Oko-Aremu trend. Approximately 500 metres to the North-West of the OMZ lies the recent NW OKO discovery where NWOD-22 intercepted 15.0m @ 6.3 g/t [See Press Release dated February 13, 2024]. The company will be introducing an additional drill rig at NW OKO.\nThe Company\u2019s mandate is to add value through additional discoveries to complement the continuing expansion of the OMZ and Ghanie resource with a focused on exploring near surface mineralization. In April 2024, the Company is to commence drilling at Tracy, located a further 5-kilometres along strike. Subsequently, G2 will initiate drilling at Aremu.\nDan Noone, CEO, comments, \u201cthe updated MRE provides an excellent platform from which to continue district wide target definition and drill programs in parallel with resource expansion at OMZ and Ghanie.\u201d To this end, the Company is targeting a further resource estimate update in Q4 2024.\nTable 1 \u2013 Summary of Mineral Resource Estimate\nDeposit\nMining Method\nCategory\nZone\nTonnage\nGold Avg.

Processing cost of US$12/t for saprolite and US$15/t for fresh rock and a General and Administration cost of US$2.5/t.\nFor surface mining the open pits at Oko and Ghanie use slope angles of 30\u00b0 in saprolite and 50\u00b0 in fresh rock.\nThe MRE has been classified in the Indicated and Inferred categories following spatial continuity analysis and geological confidence.\nThe block models for Oko and Ghanie are orthogonal and use a parent block size of 10 m x 3 m x 10 m with the narrow side across strike (East-West) and a minimum child block of 2 m x 0.5 m x 1 m.\nThe open pit optimization uses a re-blocked size of 10 m x 9 m x 10 m and for the underground optimization uses stopes of 20 m long by 20 m high and a minimum mining width of 2 m.\nThe mineral resources described above have been prepared in accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Standards and Practices.\nMessrs. Alan J. San Martin, MAusIMM(CP) and William J. Lewis, P.Geo. from Micon International Limited are the Qualified Persons (QPs) for this Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE).\nNumbers have been rounded to the nearest thousand and differences may occur in totals due to rounding.\nMineral resources are not mineral reserves as they have not demonstrated economic viability. The quantity and grade of reported Indicated and Inferred mineral resources in this news release are uncertain in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to define any measured resource; however, it is reasonably expected that a significant portion of inferred mineral resources could be upgraded into indicated mineral resources with further exploration.\nThe QPs are not aware of any known environmental, permitting, legal, title-related, taxation, socio-political, marketing or other relevant issue that could materially affect the mineral resource estimate.\nFigure 1. \u2013 Oko Project Long Section Looking West\nFigure 2. \u2013 Oko Project Vertical Section Looking North\nA plan view of the Oko and Ghanie Zones is available here.\nData validation\nThe drilling database used to estimate the Mineral Resources reported in this press release was reviewed by Micon International Limited. A site visit was conducted by Alan J. San Martin, MAusIMM(CP), to inspect mineralized intervals, alteration assemblages and QA/QC protocols and to conduct field checks of trenches and to validate drill collars. Database verifications consisted of drill logs (including lithology, alteration, weathering), assay certificates, sample intervals, drill hole collars, downhole survey information and QA/QC results validations.\nQA/QC\nDrill core is logged and sampled in a secure core storage facility located on the OKO project site, Guyana. Core samples from the program are cut in half, using a diamond cutting saw, and are sent to MSALABS Guyana, in Georgetown, Guyana, which is an accredited mineral analysis laboratory, for analysis. Samples from sections of core with obvious gold mineralisation are analysed for total gold using an industry-standard 500g metallic screen fire assay (MSALABS method MSC 550). All other samples are analysed for gold using standard Fire Assay-AA with atomic absorption finish (MSALABS method; FAS-121). Samples returning over 10.0 g/t gold are analysed utilizing standard fire assay gravimetric methods (MSALABS method; FAS-425).

Currency volatility gauges hit their highest in more than two months.\nMonday's news of a surprise March U.S. retail sales surge saw economists revise up their first-quarter U.S. economic growth estimates to just under 3% annualised.

Kelvin Wong, senior market analyst at Oanda Asia Pacificce Pte Ltd. told Bloomberg that the rise could have been \u201cdriven by stop-loss orders.\u201d\nThe Relationship Between Gold and Interest Rate Hikes\nTypically, gold prices rise when interest rates drop, since gold pays no interest. But Powell\u2019s comments did not indicate impending rate cuts. Rather, in his speech last week, he pointed out that the U.S. has not yet felt the full effects of the 5.25% rate hikes of the past two years.\n\u201cHaving come so far so quickly, the (Federal Open Market Committee) is moving forward carefully, as the risks of under- and over-tightening are becoming more balanced,\u201d he said at an event at Spelman College in Atlanta, reported by Reuters. He also reiterated during the speech that the fight against inflation may not be over.\n\u201cWe are prepared to tighten policy further if it becomes appropriate to do so,\u201d Powell said at the meeting.\nHowever, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities told Reuters, \u201c[Powell] used the word \u2018balanced,\u2019 and the message he\u2019s sending is the Fed is not going to change its rhetoric, but things are going the way they want them to go and they\u2019re not going to raise rates again \u2026 They\u2019re done, they\u2019re finished, and that\u2019s what the market thinks.\u201d\nShould You Invest In Gold?\nIf this is true, and interest rates may begin falling in the new year, there\u2019s still time to get in on a 2023 gold rush. In fact, experts at CBSNews.com warned not to wait until 2024 to invest in gold. Although the price jumped with investor optimism this month, the precious metal still has room for growth.",

        "full_text": "Getting Rich Quick: Tony Robbins\u2019 7 Wealth Tools Could Make You a Fortune\nChris Ozarowski\n6 min read\nOne of Tony Robbins\u2019 main pieces of advice to investors is to create a three-bucket system for allocating your money. The first of these buckets is the security bucket: cash savings and safe investments such as bonds or market-linked certificates of deposit, which you can use as a foundation for building wealth. Another is investing in your dreams, whether that\u2019s a vacation, a gift for your family or an important purchase.\nHowever, the middle bucket is the growth/risk bucket. This is where Robbins says the opportunity for rapid returns can be found. By taking controlled risks with money you can afford to lose and picking your investments carefully, you may be able to grow your money faster than you would with a passive index fund or savings account.\nEquities represent shares of ownership in a company. Investors buy stocks with the expectation that their value will increase over time as the company grows.\nReturns on equities come from capital gains (selling the stock at a higher price than it was bought for) and dividends (periodic payments made to shareholders from the company\u2019s profits). A well-performing company can see its stock price rise significantly, offering substantial returns to its shareholders.\nThe main risk with equities is volatility. Stock prices can fluctuate widely based on external factors like economic conditions, market trends and the company\u2019s performance.\nOwning individual stocks is riskier than with diversified investments such as mutual funds or exchange-traded funds because a poor performance from a single company can significantly impact your investment.\nHigh-yield bonds are issued by companies with lower credit ratings. The \u201cjunk\u201d status comes from the higher risk of default; but, in return, these bonds usually offer higher interest rates to attract investors. The primary return on high-yield bonds is the interest income they provide, which is higher than that of more secure bonds due to the increased risk.\nThe main risk is the possibility of default. If the issuing company runs into financial trouble, it may not be able to pay back the bond\u2019s principal amount or continue making interest payments. This can lead to significant losses for investors.\nCompanies aren\u2019t the only entities that issue high-risk, high-reward bonds. While bonds from countries like the U.S. are usually considered to be safe investments, countries such as Turkey, Egypt and Zambia offer bonds with much higher yields and much higher risks.\nHowever, investors should carefully research the country in question before investing. These yields are often high because the country has either recently defaulted on its debt or is likely to do so in the future.\nReal Estate\nReal estate investing involves purchasing properties either to sell at a profit or to rent out for ongoing income. This can include residential, commercial or industrial properties. Investors can profit from real estate through rental income and property appreciation. As real estate values increase, returns can be realized through selling at a higher market price or refinancing at better terms.\nThe risk with real estate is that the market can be volatile and properties can depreciate in value due to environmental or occupant damage. Other risks include liquidity constraints (it\u2019s not always quick or easy to sell property), high initial investment costs and the ongoing expenses of property management and maintenance.\nCommodities\nCommodities include physical goods such as gold, oil and agricultural products. Investing in commodities often involves buying futures contracts or commodity-linked financial instruments instead of the commodity itself. That way, you don\u2019t need to figure out where to physically store your investment in wheat or oil, for example.\nReturns come from price changes in the market, driven by supply and demand. For example, gold prices might rise during economic uncertainty as investors seek safe havens for their money.\nHowever, commodity prices can be volatile. Factors such as weather conditions, political instability and changes in economic policies can drastically affect the prices for different commodities. Each commodity will have its own set of factors that affect the price. If you\u2019re going to invest in orange juice futures, for instance, make sure you know what\u2019s needed for a good orange harvest.\nAlso, commodity futures investors should be aware of expiration dates. If the contract is held through the expiration date, the trader must be prepared to take or make a delivery of the physical commodity, according to the terms of the contract. Your brokerage may automatically close your trade for you before that happens; if it doesn\u2019t, you may end up having to figure out where to put your new sacks of soybeans.\nCurrencies\nForeign exchange (forex) trading involves exchanging one currency for another in hopes that the currency you buy will gain strength relative to the one you sell. Profits are made on the fluctuations in exchange rates between pairs of currencies. If you buy euros with U.S. dollars and the euro strengthens relative to the dollar, you can sell the euros back for more dollars than you initially paid.\nThe forex market is influenced by global economic conditions, interest rates, political events and market speculation, which makes it highly volatile and complex. Forex trading is not something to jump into lightly.\nCollectibles\nCollectibles include art, rare coins, stamps, vintage cars and other unique objects. These assets are considered alternative investments and can appreciate in value over time. Money is made when these items are sold at a higher price than they were purchased for. The appreciation can be significant if the items become more desirable over time.\nThe risk with collectibles is that the market can be niche and highly subjective. Values can fluctuate unpredictably based on consumer interest and market trends. Additionally, there are concerns over authenticity, preservation and liquidity. If you store your collectibles incorrectly and they get damaged, you can lose your entire investment all at once.\nStructured Notes\nStructured notes are debt securities issued by financial institutions. The returns depend on the conditions set in the notes, typically linked to the performance of an underlying asset. If the asset performs well, the note pays out according to a predefined formula; if not, the payout might be less, or even zero.\nThe primary risk is the lack of principal protection. Investors might lose part or all of their initial investments if the underlying asset performs poorly. There is also credit risk, as the ability to pay depends on the issuer\u2019s financial health.\nConsult an Advisor\nEach of these investments fits into Tony Robbins\u2019 growth/risk bucket and could offer you high returns. However, each also carries its own set of risks. It is always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor before making any risky investments. A qualified advisor can provide personalized insights and guidance for your specific financial situation so you can get the best return for your money.",

(TSX-V:MKO)(OTCQX:MAKOF) (\"Mako\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to provide first quarter 2024 (\"Q1 2024\") production results from its San Albino gold mine (\"San Albino\") in northern Nicaragua, which is the eleventh full quarter of production results since declaring commercial production on July 1, 2021.\nQ1 2024 Production and Financial Highlights\nRecord 67,961 tonnes mined containing 13,965 ounces of gold (\"oz Au\") at a blended grade of 6.39 grams per tonne gold (\"g/t Au\") and 15,718 ounces of silver (\"oz Ag\") at a grade of 7.19 grams per tonne silver (\"g/t Ag\")\n25,374 tonnes mined containing 9,664 oz Au at 11.85 g/t Au and 9,919 oz Ag at 12.16 g/t Ag from diluted vein material\n42,587 tonnes mined containing 4,301 oz Au at 3.14 g/t Au and 5,799 oz Ag at 4.24 g/t Ag from historical dump and other mineralized material above cutoff grade (\"historical dump + other\")\n22.7:1 strip ratio\n52,478 tonnes milled containing 12,266 oz Au at a blended grade of 7.27 g/t Au and 14,071 oz Ag at 8.34 g/t Ag\n36% and 64% from diluted vein and historical dump and other, respectively\n606 tonnes per day (\"tpd\") milled at 96% availability\nRecoveries of 80.6% for gold in Q1 2024\n150,744 tonnes in stockpile containing 12,465 oz Au at a blended grade of 2.57 g/t Au\n10,070 oz Au Equiv. recovered and 9,332 oz Au. Equiv. sold during the quarter\nDelivered 40,500 oz of silver on the Sailfish Silver Loan for a total of US$ 0.9 million during Q1 2024\nEntered into an environmental settlement and release agreement with GR Silver comprising US$0.5 million and the issuance of 296,710 common shares of Mako\nC$ 2.8 million in share repurchases equating to 1 million shares at an average price of C$ 2.80 so far in 2024\nAprox. US$ 3.0 million increase in cash balance in Q1 2024 vs. Q4 2023\nAkiba Leisman, Chief Executive Officer of Mako states that, \"Q1 2024 was another highly profitable quarter for the Company, with recovered gold equivalent of over 10,000 ounces at industry leading AISC. The mine reported quarterly record throughput rates, which was achieved as we positively reconcile to the resource model, bringing in significantly more tonnes of mineralized material to the mine plan. Exploration is ramping up at site, the NCIB has been accelerated, and cash is building on the balance sheet as we prepare to close the Goldsource Mines acquisition later this quarter.\"\nTable 1 - Production Results\n* Includes historical dump, hanging wall, footwall, historical muck and all other non-vein mineralized material above cutoff grade. **For the purpose of calculating revenue, payments to Sailfish are deducted from the Average Realized Price. (1) Equiv. Gold ounces are calculated by: Silver Rec. or Silver Sold (oz) / Avg. Realized Price of Gold (US$/oz) / Avg. Realized Price of Silver (US$/oz)\nTable 2 - Quarter End Stockpile Statistics\n** Includes historical dump, hanging wall, footwall, historical muck and all other non-vein mineralized material above cutoff grade.\nMining\nThe mine averaged 747 tpd of diluted vein and historical dump + other material in Q1 2024, which was by far the highest mining rate of mineralized material in the Company's history. This record came in a large part from a significant positive reconciliation of mineralized tonnes to the resource model. The strip ratio was 22.7:1 which included pre-stripping of the Southwest Pit within San Albino, and the commencement of the bulk sample of El Limon within Las Conchitas - South. The current stockpile is 150,743 tonnes containing 12,474 oz Au at 2.57 g/t Au. The average grade of the diluted vein was 11.85 g/t Au containing 9,664 oz Au.\nThe total production of diluted vein material in Q1 2024 came from 3 different zones; 39% of the total ounces were mined from the West Pit (San Albino), 19% from the Southwest Pit (San Albino), and 41% from Phase 1 in the Bayacun Pit (Las Conchitas). In Q2 2024, an important part of the production will also come from Phase 1 of the El Limon Pit (Las Conchitas).\nMilling\nAll components of the 500 tpd gravity and carbon-in-leach processing plant have been fully operational since the beginning of May 2021. During Q1 2024, the plant throughput rate was 606 tpd with a plant availability of 96%. The plant processed 36% diluted vein material and 64% historical dump + other material to achieve a blended feed grade of 7.27 g/t Au. The gold recovery was lower at 80.6 % in Q1 compared to 84.6% in Q4 due to lower gold grades, and higher preg-robbing potential of the mill feed. This was due to differences in the upper portion of the Las Conchitas vein morphology as compared to San Albino, which led to higher amounts of peripheral, low-grade, preg-robbing material being included in the diluted vein. In addition, very little oxide material was processed, as the production predominantly came from relatively deeper material. In the latter half of Q2, a substantial portion of the mill feed will come from oxide material at El Limon, which should incrementally improve recoveries. The plant availability was 96% with 10,070 ounces of gold equivalent recovered.\nQualified Person\nJohn Rust, a metallurgical engineer and qualified person (as defined under NI 43-101) has read and approved the technical information contained in this press release.

With a total defined 5.2 Moz Au in-pit constrained S-K 1300 compliant resource (Table 1) across 4 deposits, the Estelle Gold Project has development optionality in terms of initial project size and scale, which is subject to market conditions and strategic partners to meet our objective of ultimately growing the Estelle Gold Project into a tier 1 gold producer. The Feasibility Study currently underway is considering a strategy to achieve production with a scalable operation, by:\n1.\nEstablishing an initial low capex smaller scale operation at the high-grade RPM deposit requiring less infrastructure for expected early cashflow and high margins to potentially self-fund expansion plans; and/or\n2.\nDevelop the higher capex larger mining operation for increased gold production, cash flow, and mine life that potential future large gold company strategic partners have expressed an interest.\nWork Plan and PFS Highlights:\n\u25cf\nResource Drilling. Program focused at RPM to increase and prove-up resources as part of the Feasibility Study utilizing the company owned drill rig to achieve a cost efficient program (Figures 1 to 5).\n\u25cf\nMineral Resource Estimate (MRE). Update to include the 2023 and 2024 drilling data and to incorporate the higher gold price for an updated resource.\n\u25cf\nLIDAR. Detailed survey across the property to enable detailed infrastructure design, mineral reserve classification, exploration, etc.\n\u25cf\nHeap Leach. Metallurgical test work is currently underway with METS Engineering to include a low-cost gold recovery method option in the flow sheet for processing lower grade ores to potentially substantially reduce capex and increase the gold production profile.\n\u25cf\nGeotechnical. Detailed studies are underway to potentially increase pit slope angles further. Early indications show very competent geology, with the study results expected to have a significant positive impact on the project economics.\n\u25cf\nOre Sorting. FS level test work to commence to investigate the additional benefit of using Steinart multiple sensor technologies and further improve on previous exceptional results from utilizing XRT density sorting. Ore sorting results to date have shown the potential to significantly improve resource extraction providing processing optionality, which is expected to reduce overall processing costs, increase total gold production, and increase the life of mine. In addition, planning is underway to complete a future 200kt bulk pit pilot test program to further de-risk ore sorting and optimize material handling and flow. The expected benefits of ore sorting to improve project economics include:\n\u25cb\nPre-concentration of mill feed by separating it into high-grade, low-grade and waste fractions\n\u25cb\nSelective high grading of lower grade ores and existing waste dumps\n\u25cb\nReduction of environmental risks and costs \u2013 smaller tailings dam footprint\n\u25cb\nOptimization of multiple process streams, for example, sending appropriate ore to the mill and heap leach\n\u25cb\nPre-concentration of ore in order to reduce transportation costs\n\u25cb\nLowering operating costs\n\u25cb\nImproving ore grade\n\u25cf\nCritical Elements. In addition to copper and silver, highly elevated concentrations of Antimony and other critical elements have been discovered at numerous prospects across the Estelle Project. These elements have the potential to provide significant by-product credits to the project. The Company continues to include multi-element analysis for all samples to define these resources for potential future extraction from the gold processing waste stream, and/or as a stand-alone small-scale operation for near term cash flow, i.e. for antimony production which is found in prospects outside of the existing gold deposits. The Company continues to pursue this opportunity as well as federal and state grants for critical minerals development studies and extraction/refining plant capital requirements. The US Government is engaged in providing grant funding and support through the Defense Production Act (DPA) and other legislation to establish and fully secure US domestic critical minerals supply chains which are currently controlled by foreign adversaries. The Estelle Gold Project with its potential of contained critical mineral resources and other key project aspects could contribute to achieving these US national security objectives.\nNova CEO, Mr Christopher Gerteisen commented: \u201cIn less than 5 years we have taken the project from green fields to a total 5.2 Moz Au in-pit constrained S-K 1300 compliant resource with a FS now in progress. We have focused defining high confidence resources for conversion to reserves at 2 deposits, RPM and Korbel, from the over 20 prospects across the Estelle Gold Project on our path towards production. Now in the FS stage, the asset is progressing towards development with our strategy reflecting the flexibility of the project to current market conditions and our commitment to balance sheet management, with a low-capex, expected high margin, scalable start-up operation with potential self-funded expansion and/or a strategic partner to advance the full-scale production scenario to ultimately realize our goal of becoming a tier 1 gold producer with the Estelle Gold Project.\u201d\nThis strategy provides a defined path to production designed to provide free cashflow, while potentially allowing us to continue to unlock the district organically and to deliver on our prior track record of resource growth, new discoveries, at a low-cost per discovery ounce.\u201d\n2024 RPM Drill Plan\nHighly targeted and strategic drilling at the RPM deposit continues, with the Company owned Reverse Circulation (RC) rig working to upgrade and expand the current resource. Of the drilling planned for 2024, the majority will be allocated to advance the RPM high grade starter pit area and to further delineate the at-surface, high-grade (1 g/t Au to > 5 g/t Au) zone encountered there during 2022-2023 drilling, while upgrading inferred resources and testing for potential near surface extensions of the high-grade gold system to the south and west (Figures 1 to 5). Drilling at RPM will be complemented by ongoing metallurgical work and environmental surveys as outlined in this announcement along with studies as necessary to inform economic assessment of the discovery to gain a head start for a potential initial low capex smaller scale operation at the high-grade RPM deposit requiring less infrastructure for early cashflow and high margins to self-fund expansion plans.\nDue to the speed, efficiency and lower costs of running the Company owned RC rig on labor hire only, when compared to diamond drilling, this drill program is designed to be conducted at a lower cost, while providing the necessary data density to meet our objectives of expanding and proving up a significant amount of the existing RPM resource into the Measured and Indicated categories to allow conversion into economic reserves for the upcoming FS.\nThe Company looks forward to announcing the assay results from the drill campaign as they come in to assess the significance of the observations in Figures 1-4.\nFigure 1.

Gold reserves increased by 10.5% YoY, as shown in the company presentation below:\nOne of the company's advantages is the location of its mines, primarily in the Northern Americas and Australia, which provides better security than most of its competitors, who operate in less favorable jurisdictions such as Africa.\nAmmar Al-Joundi, President and Chief Executive Officer, said in the conference call:\n2023 highlights and full-year, four important milestones and achievements. One, record gold production. Best ever in the quarter, best ever for a full year. That's impressive for any company. It's especially impressive, I think, for a company that's been around for 66 years. Two, record cash from operations. Best ever in a quarter, best ever in a year. Three, record mineral reserves, up 10%. It's almost 54 million ounces.\n4Q23 and Full-year 2023 Results Snapshot\nAEM posted a net loss of $381.011 million in 4Q23, or $0.77 per diluted share, compared with $194.11 million, or $0.45, in 4Q22. Adjusted net income was $282.03 million in 4Q23.\nThis quarter, the company generated revenues of $1,756.64 million, a significant increase from $1,384.70 million in 4Q22. Revenues rose 26.9% YoY and 7% sequentially. Due to the recent acquisition of the remaining 50% of Canadian Malartic, the revenue comparison is not completely accurate.\nThe fourth quarter of 2023 set a new record of 903,208 Au ounces, outpacing the previous year's production of 799,438 Au. The all-in-sustaining costs (\"AISC\") per ounce fell to $1,227 from $1,231 in 4Q22. AEM sold 874,629 Au Oz in the fourth quarter of 2023. Agnico Eagle is currently producing gold from twelve mines; details are provided below:\nFurthermore, Agnico Eagle achieved another record year by producing 3,439,654 gold-equivalent ounces at the top of the guidance and generating $6,626,910 in revenue, as shown in the graph below:\nNote that the production forecast for 2023 is 3.243.44 million ounces, with 3.5 million ounces expected by 2025. The company also provided a production forecast for 20242026. Production in 2024 is expected to be 3.353.55 million ounces, a slight increase from the previous year, with AISC remaining stable at $1,200 to $1,250 per ounce. Based on the most recent company presentation:\nStock Performance\nAgnico Eagle, Newmont Corp. (NYSE:NEM), and Barrick Gold Corp. (NYSE:GOLD) are my top picks for a solid long-term gold mining portfolio. All three senior gold producers are down year over year, with NEM currently losing the most. However, one advantage is that these businesses are stable and will eventually outperform the market.\nAdditionally, all three pay dividends ranging from 2.82% to 4.82%, with AEM currently yielding 3.29%. Unfortunately, we learned today that NEM has reduced its quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share from $0.40 per share.\nInvestment Thesis\nThe investment thesis for AEM is straightforward. I recommend accumulating AEM on weaknesses. AEM owns senior gold mines of the highest quality, with significant growth potential, in low-risk mining areas.\nThe company has paid dividends for 40 years in a row and has gold mineral reserves of 53.811 million ounces as of December 2023, having acquired the remaining 50% interest in the Canadian Malartic complex and recently declaring mineral reserves at the East Gouldie project.\nUnfortunately, in 2023, there was less of a correlation between AEM and gold bullion, which has historically tracked the precious metal. Despite the fact that gold is now priced well above $2,000 per ounce, producers have followed the overall market, and are quite depressed now. This bearish situation applies to the entire gold mining industry, not just AEM. However, analysts see better days on the horizon.\nJ.P. Morgan indicated last month that the long-term outlook for gold is positive despite a possible dip in the near term before trending higher with a peak of $2,300 in 2025.\nAfter a hiking cycle that pushed the Fed funds rate to its highest in more than 22 years, policymakers on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) have indicated at least three rate cuts in 2024, as inflation eases from the 40-year highs seen in mid-2022. With gold prices hovering around $2,000/oz, is another bullish run expected for the precious metal as rates begin to fall?\nHowever, I believe that the tight correlation between gold and miners will soon resume. AEM expects to sell its gold for more than $2,000 in 2024, resulting in significant free cash flow. The market is waiting for the Fed to signal a clear shift in interest rates at the end of H1 2024 before buying miners and pushing gold above $2,150 per ounce.\nGold Production Details\nQuarterly Gold Production\nThis quarter's production was 903,208 gold equivalent ounces, up from 799,438 last year. It was a new record for production, as shown below:\nAs shown below, La Ronde Complex and particularly Detour Mine performed very well sequentially.\nThe company also produced 655K Ag Oz, 1,384 tons of zinc, and 682 tons of copper. Silver was priced at $23.88 per ounce, zinc at $1.14 per pound, and copper at $3.63.\nIn 4Q23, all-in sustainable costs, or AISC, averaged $1,227 per ounce, down from $1,231 in the same period last year.\nBalance Sheet Analysis\n1: Revenues of $1,757 million in 4Q23\nAgnico Eagle Mines Limited's revenues were $1,756.64 million, up 26.9% from the same quarter last year and 7.0% quarter-over-quarter. It set a new revenue record and demonstrated tremendous strength.\nThe company reported a net loss of $381.011 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2022. The fourth quarter of 2023 saw adjusted net income of $282.03 million, or $0.57 per share.\nAgnico Eagle stated that the quarterly net loss includes impairment charges totaling $667 million (net of taxes), or $1.35 per share, for the Macassa and Pinos Altos mines.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, one ounce of gold sold for $1,982 (a new multi-year high). During the quarter, cash from operating activities totaled $727.86 million, up from $380.50 million the previous year.\n2: Free Cash Flow was $302.12 million in 4Q23\nThe trailing 12-month free cash flow (\"FCF\") is estimated at $936.49 million (\"TTM\"), while the free cash flow for 4Q23 is estimated at $302.12 million. The declared quarterly dividend is $0.40 per share, representing a 3.28% yield.\n3: Net debt was $1,504.5 million in 4Q23.\nAgnico Eagle's financials are solid, with a net debt of $1,504.5 million, down slightly quarter over quarter.\nAgnico Eagle's total cash in 4Q23 was $338.65 million, down from $658.63 million in 4Q22 (restated). With current debt included, long-term debt increased to $1,843.1 million from $1,342.07 million in 4Q22. Agnico Eagle has excellent liquidity at $2,339 million after increasing its credit facility to $2 billion in February 2024. From the Agnico Eagle Presentation:\nTechnical Analysis and Commentary.\nNote that the chart has been adjusted to reflect dividends.\nAEM follows a descending channel pattern, with resistance at $50 and support at $46.4. The RSI is now 55 and ascending, indicating a possible retest of $53. However, the resistance is just below and will be difficult to overcome following the recent announcement of results.\nDescending channel patterns, also known as falling channels, are short-term bearish patterns that often appear as continuation patterns within longer-term uptrends. As previously stated, I believe that the predominant bearish trend for gold miners will reverse later in 2024.\nThe trading strategy is to sell LIFO Agnico Eagle Mines shares for about 40% of your position between $49.9 and $50.7, with a potential upper resistance at $53. Conversely, I suggest buying shares between $47.0 and $46.0, with possible lower support at $44.25.\nFinally, keep in mind that the TA Chart is only valid for one or two weeks at most, assuming no major news is expected. To be accurate and implement a viable strategy, you should update your analysis every five to seven trading days.",

This is an important fact, even though its revenue and profits are driven by the sale of these precious metals. So, \"production\" levels are important to monitor, but you have to look at the company in a slightly unique way.\nHere's why the magic number for Wheaton is looking like it could be 1 million ounces.\nWheaton is not a miner\nWheaton is a streaming and royalty company. That means that it provides miners with cash up front for the right to buy gold, silver, and other metals at reduced rates in the future. The cash that miners receive is usually put toward capital investment projects, like the construction of new mines or the upgrading of existing ones. The benefit of working with a company like Wheaton is that the miner gets access to cash without having to take on debt, which protects its balance sheet, or sell stock, which limits shareholder dilution. Often, the gold and silver that Wheaton buys are just byproducts of other metal mining activities, like mining for copper.\nThis is a clear win for the miner, but it is also a win for Wheaton. The price that Wheaton pays for gold and silver is usually set as a percentage of the current market price when it is bought. That, effectively, locks in a profit for Wheaton, as the company simply turns around and sells the gold and silver it buys at market rates to generate revenue. Thus, the streaming and royalty agreements it inks basically afford it strong profit margins in both good commodity markets and bad ones.\nWith that quick overview, it is probably more appropriate to view Wheaton as a company with a portfolio of mine investments. Those investments span across regions, miners, and, more to the point here, mine development stages. So there's a mix of assets that are producing and getting ready to start producing (new mines) or on the verge of producing more (mine upgrades). Given the expected production profiles of all of the assets in the mix, Wheaton has provided guidance on the gold and silver it will \"produce\" from its activities.\nThe whisper number is 1 million\nAs it stands today, Wheaton produced roughly 617,000 gold equivalent ounces in 2022. Gold equivalent ounces simply lump gold and silver together into one number, which makes production easier to track. In 2023, the company expects to produce between 600,000 and 660,000 gold equivalent ounces. Mine production can vary based on a lot of factors, so this is a reasonable range.\nHowever, the company is currently expecting the investments in its portfolio to lead to gold production of roughly 900,000 ounces by 2027. So in just a few years, the company's production will increase by as much as 50%! That's a step change that investors shouldn't ignore. Only, during the company's third-quarter conference call, management was a bit more optimistic than even that figure. Although no commitment was made to the number, the company hinted that it could eventually update the 900,000 target to 1 million.",

He said in a recent note that the latest gold run is \"especially impressive,\" because it not only surpassed bitcoin and every major currency, but also overcame typical macro headwinds that often depress its value.\n\"The rise in the gold price has come at a time of dollar strength, falling inflation expectations, and during which the Fed has moved market expectations toward a 'higher for longer' conviction. All those developments would typically hurt the gold price, but it's forged ahead regardless,\" his team wrote in the note.\nBut before plunging into the hype around bullion's future, it's worth peeling back what's behind the recent surge.\nStrong demand\nRosenberg and his team said the major driver of the latest highs wasn't so much on the supply side \u2014 which has been steady in recent years \u2014 but rather on the demand side, thanks to central banks' reembrace of it as a reserve asset.\nWith the Chinese yuan losing its grip as the world's second reserve currency, and as nations like Japan, Russia, Turkey, and Poland fear overreliance on US dollars, many have turned to gold for security as they weathered idiosyncratic economic risks.\n\"After divesting from gold in the early part of the century (physically backed reserves were oh so pass\u00e9), central banks are once again building up their gold holdings, and at scale,\" he said, adding that central banks bought 361 tonnes of gold in the third quarter of 2023, a turnaround from -77 tonnes in 2022's same period.\nThey also found gold shines more in emerging markets like India and China, while Western investors lag behind as high interest rates and booming stock prices dim lower-yielding gold's allure.\nBesides, rising industrial usage especially within the highly active electronics sector, is another price pusher.",

The company assumes no obligation to update such forward-looking information in the future except as required by law. I would now like to turn the call over to Jorge Alberto Ganoza, President, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder of Fortuna.\nJorge Alberto Ganoza: Thank you, Carlos. Fortuna had a strong close to 2023. In the fourth quarter, we recorded $66 million in free cash flow from ongoing operations, which is consistent with the $70 million recorded in the third quarter. We achieved a record 136,000 gold equivalent ounces in the period as well and realized an average gold price of $1,990 per ounce, yielding record sales of $265 million. Our consolidated AISC for the period was $1,509 per gold equivalent ounce. We are using the strong proceeds of the business to advance payments on our corporate credit facility, paying $40 million in the third quarter, $41 million in the fourth quarter, and subsequent to year-end, we paid an additional $25 million between the end of February and early March.\nWe have a favorable debt-to-EBITDA ratio of under 0.3 and a total net debt of approximately $83 million. Providing enhanced flexibility to our balance sheet through debt reduction is one of our capital allocation priorities in 2024, and we expect to achieve zero net debt during this year. Another capital allocation priority is funding high value organic growth opportunities in the portfolio and attractive acquisitions in the regions where we are already established. Our $38 million exploration program this year includes 200,000 meters of drilling with a focus on the Diamba Sud in Senegal and S\u00e9gu\u00e9la in C\u00f4te d\u00b4Ivoire. For reserve replacement, our priorities continue to focus on the San Jose and Yaramoko mines. In the short to medium term, both the Diamba Sud project in Senegal and the S\u00e9gu\u00e9la mine in C\u00f4te d\u00b4Ivoire are our strongest drivers for growth and value.\nDavid Whittle, our Chief Operating Officer for West Africa, will explain later. At S\u00e9gu\u00e9la, at the end of December, we are processing ore at a rate which is 26% higher than nameplate capacity and encountering positive rate reconciliation at their starter Antenna Pit. In the fourth quarter, we obtained 24% more gold ounces than predicted by the reserve model. And the property continues to offer tremendous discovery opportunities, which we are diligently pursuing with our exploration. At the Diamba Sud, we currently hold an 850,000-ounce gold resource, which we catalog as historical and has not been incorporated to our consolidated resource. We expect to enhance our knowledge of the mineral deposit and expand it with our ongoing 45,000-meter drill program and be in a position by the year-end to deliver a preliminary economic assessment.\nAt both the San Jose and Yaramoko mines, we continue pursuing reserve replacement with well-funded drill programs. At San Jose, we are targeting the Yessi Vein, high-grade silver gold discovery made in 2023. At Yaramoko, we have achieved a lot of success expanding reserves on the fringes of the Zone 55 deep ore body. We will be reporting on results from our exploration programs in West Africa and Latin America later in March. Another capital allocation consideration is our share buyback program, which was under a temporary restriction placed by the credit facility bank syndicate. This restriction was lifted by us in early January, and with the financial results blackout behind us, we may now participate again in the market. And considering available liquidity, capital allocation opportunities, and the state of company valuation in the market, we may be participating again in the market.\nSo, with that, I will now let our Chief Operating Officers provide some further detail on our operations to the region. So, we can start with West Africa. David, do you want to go ahead?\nDavid Whittle: Thanks, Jorge. S\u00e9gu\u00e9la and Yaramoko had a successful fourth quarter from both a safety and production perspective. Both mines recorded zero LTIs and Yaramoko reached an exceptional milestone of three years LTI3 in 2023 and obtained ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 certifications. In the fourth quarter, S\u00e9gu\u00e9la produced 43,096 ounces of gold, a 37% improvement compared to the previous quarter, and delivered 78,617 ounces of gold to 2023, outperforming annual production guidance by 5%. Yaramoko's strong production performance delivered 28,235 ounces of gold, leading to 117,711 ounces of gold to the year, achieving the higher end of the revised annual production guidance. In the fourth quarter of 2023, S\u00e9gu\u00e9la mined 409,293 tonnes of ore, with an average gold grade of 3.34 grams per tonne, and 2,214,681 tonnes of waste with a strip ratio of 5.4. All processed was 387,267 tonnes at 3.62 grams per tonne of gold.\nMining operations focused mainly on Antenna Pit to provide ore feed to the processing plant. At the Antenna Pit, haul road and other development was completed, and topsoil and waste stripping commenced with 104,472 tonnes of waste stripping being achieved. Preparations for the mining of the Koula Pit commenced during the quarter, with grade control drilling and haul road construction being undertaken. Processing plant operations continued to ramp up beyond the nameplate capacity of 154 tonnes an hour during the quarter, achieving an average throughput of 186 tonnes per hour. In December, an average throughput of 194 tonnes per hour was obtained, 26% higher than designed. A partial mill reline was undertaken in February, and we are now successfully further testing throughput constraints.\nThe goal recovery for the quarter was 94.9%, slightly ahead of the 94.5% design recovery, benefiting from the higher head grade. The second lift of the tailing storage facility is currently under construction, and is expected to be completed by the end of this quarter. This will assure adequate tailing storage for another two years of production at the increased throughput rates. S\u00e9gu\u00e9la's strong performance resulted in both a cash cost of $341 and an AISC of $737 per ounce of gold, both below guidance. At Yaramoko, mine production in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 112,906 tonnes, at an average grade of 7.33 grams per tonne gold. Mining operations were primarily sourced from the 55 Zone underground mine. Development and stoping operations of the Bagassi South mine contributed 10,162 tonnes at 6.05 grams per tonne gold to the above outputs, with batch treatment of Bagassi ore showing a very close correlation to the mine core.\nAt the processing plant, 110,445 tonnes were treated at an average grade of 7.16 grams per tonne gold, with a recovery at 98.3%. The decreased processing tonnes are attributed to a planned shutdown for 11 days in December '23. The enhanced production resulted in the cash cost and AISC at Yaramoko being below the lower end of annual guidance for the year at [$817] and $1,499 per ounce of gold, respectively. Development operations and diamond drilling success enabled further strike extensions of the 55 Zone ore body to the east of the expected mining boundaries, as well as strike extensions and mineable displays of the QV prime ore body at the Bagassi South mine. Back to you, Jorge.\nJorge Alberto Ganoza: Thank you, David. Cesar, do you want to provide your report?\nCesar Velasco: Yes, thank you, Jorge, and good afternoon to everyone. In 2023, our Latin American operations successfully delivered 130,310 ounces of gold, 5.9 million ounces of silver, 40.9 million pounds of lead, and 55.1 million pounds of zinc. Consolidated gold production achieved guidance, enabled mainly by Lindero producing 101,238 ounces. The consolidated silver production was 7% below guidance due to San Jose's lower tonnage extracted from the mine, as it had to deal with a 15-day stoppage at the beginning of the year, operational difficulties thereafter, and reduced grade profile as we are operating at the tail end of reserves. Base metals with its exceptional lead and zinc production was 28.15% above guidance, respectively.\nStarting in Argentina, Lindero's gold production for the fourth quarter was 29,591 ounces, a significant increase of 41% when compared to the previous quarter. This increase was enabled by higher gold production and the extraction of 4,600 ounces contained in fine carbon and copper precipitate. Gold production for the year totaled 101,238 ounces, achieving midpoint of annual production guidance. In the fourth quarter, a total of 2.1 million tonnes of ore were mined at a stripping ratio of 0.6:1, leading to a stripping ratio of 1.14:1 for the year, aligned with the mining plan. During the same period, a total of 1.6 million tonnes of ore were placed on the leach pad at an average gold grade of 0.63 grams per tonne, containing an estimated 31,665 ounces of gold.\nLindero's annual cash cost of 920 and AISC of 1,565 per ounce of gold were both within guidance. To note, cash cost and AISC have been affected by adverse in-country macroeconomic conditions during 2023, compounded by an increase in sustaining capital expenditures mainly related to the heap leach expansion project. These costs were partially offset by improved copper by-product sales, totaling $7.7 million. As of the end of February 2024, the 41 million leach pad expansion project is approximately 28% progressed, with completion planned by the end of 2024. Those 41 million equates roughly to $410 on the AISC for 2024. While this investment weighs heavily on the company's AISC for this year, it will greatly benefit Lindero by allowing the placing of reserves over the next decade.\nIn Mexico, San Jose produced 1 million ounces of silver and 6,341 ounces of gold in the fourth quarter of 2023, with average head grades of 145 grams per tonne and 0.91 grams per tonne, respectively. Total production for 2023 was 4.7 million ounces of silver and 28,559 ounces of gold, 12% and 16% below annual guidance, respectively. The decrease in production, as I mentioned before, is attributed primarily to the 15-day illegal union blockade in the second quarter, the associated disruption to operations thereafter, a silver and gold head grade reconciliation to reserves at the lower end of guidance range, and a mine that offers less operational flexibility as it is working on the tail end of reserves. We continue to experience significant inflationary pressures in Mexico beyond what we see in other countries where Fortuna operates.\nThe 2023 cash cost of 14.40 and AISC of 19.40 per silver equivalent ounce were above guidance. Higher costs are mainly explained by a significant appreciation of the Mexican peso, which affects approximately 50% of our total cost, in addition to higher labor, contractor material and consumable costs, lower ounces produced and lower head grades, all of which are also carried into 2024 estimates. Based on exploration outcomes and the remaining life of reserves, the company is preparing to execute a multi-year progressive mine closure and monitoring plan in strict compliance with government regulations and adhering to high international standards. In Peru, the Caylloma mine produced 330,478 ounces of silver at an average head rate of 88 grams per tonne in the fourth quarter.\nSilver production for 2023 totaled 1,227,060 ounces, surpassing the upper end of guidance by 10%. Lead and zinc production for the quarter was 10.8 and 14 million pounds, with head grades averaging 3.84% and 5% respectively. Caylloma delivered strong base metal production in 2023, totaling 40.9 million pounds of lead and 55.1 million pounds of zinc, surpassing guidance by 28% and 15% respectively. Enhanced production was the result of positive grade reconciliation to the reserve model in levels 16 and 18 of the Animas vein. Back to you, Jorge.\nJorge Alberto Ganoza: We'll now proceed with a review of our financial results. Luis, please.\nLuis Dario Ganoza: Yes, thank you. So for Q4 2023, we have recorded a net loss attributable to Fortuna shareholders of $92.3 million, explained by an impermanent charge of $90.6 million related to the anticipated closure of the San Jose mine in late 2024. As had been previously disclosed, the updated mine plan is scheduled to exhaust mineral reserves by the end of this year compared to mid-2025 as previously planned. Adjusted net income in the period was $20.6 million or $0.07 per share compared to $6.4 million or $0.02 per share in the prior year. In the quarter, we have adjusted for several non-recurrent items. All of them except one are non-cash charges. I will briefly describe them on a pre-tax basis. The main one is an impairment at San Jose, as I just mentioned.\nUnder cost of sales, we have adjusted $15.4 million of write-downs comprised of $9.5 million of materials inventory at various sites and $5.9 million of low-grade stockpiles at Lindero. The materials inventory write-downs are related to a reassessment of consumption plans at San Jose in the face of the shortened life of mine for $4.4 million with a balance corresponding to Yaramoko and Lindero. The write-down of low-grade stockpiles at the Lindero mine was triggered by anticipated higher costs to completion over the life of mine. It is worth pointing out that this write-down doesn't necessarily bring into question the economic viability of the stockpiles, as the decision to stockpile low-grade ore follows an incremental cost logic while the accounting allocates costs based on an average cost method.\nUnder the line item labeled write-off of mineral properties, we have adjusted for a full $5.3 million amount, which is related to greenfields exploration projects in Mexico and Argentina. Under other expenses, we have adjusted for a $6.4 million severance provision at San Jose related to the scheduled mine closure and $1.2 million of customs penalties at S\u00e9gu\u00e9la related to the construction phase. So, back to adjusted net income, the main drivers of the increase over Q4 2022 were the contribution of the S\u00e9gu\u00e9la mine, which explains the 71% higher volume of gold sold and higher gold price of 15%, which resulted in an average of $1,990 per ounce for the quarter. Our cash cost of sales per gold equivalent ounce sold was $840 compared to $873 in the prior year.\nAs David mentioned, cash cost at S\u00e9gu\u00e9la was $323 per ounce. That would be $376 per ounce if we included capital leases related to the mining contractor, which are reported as part of AISC, but excluded from cash cost per ounce. The contribution of low-cost ounces from S\u00e9gu\u00e9la was partially offset by higher cash cost per gold equivalent ounce at Yaramoko, Lindero and San Jose in the quarter. For Yaramoko, this was primarily due to higher operating costs in Q4, partially offset by higher head rates. In the case of Lindero, the higher cost per ounce was mostly aligned with the expected reductions in head rates consistent with the mine plan. And for San Jose, this was mainly due to a shortfall of production in the quarter compared to the mine plan and lower head rates and the effect of the peso appreciation as noted by [indiscernible].\nDepreciation and depletion for the quarter was $71.6 million compared to $44.5 million in the prior year. The increase of $27 million is explained by the higher gold equivalent ounces sold and higher depletion per consolidated gold equivalent ounce of $67. This higher depletion on a per ounce basis is related primarily to S\u00e9gu\u00e9la, where total depletion and depreciation was $26 million, including $17 million corresponding to the purchase price allocation from the Roxgold acquisition. On income taxes, we have recorded $27 million of current income tax compared to $7.8 million in Q4 2022. The increase is mostly explained by S\u00e9gu\u00e9la. We note that tax paid in the quarter was $6.3 million as we will be paying taxes for the first time at S\u00e9gu\u00e9la in 2024.\nMoving on to free cash flow and liquidity, we reported $66 million of free cash flow from ongoing operations. This is after sustaining CapEx and corporate expenses. Our total liquidity at the end of the quarter was $213 million, up $51 million from the end of September 2023, reflecting the strong free cash flow generation in the quarter. We paid down $40.5 million of debt in Q4 2023 and have made, as Jorge pointed out, subsequent payments of $25 million up to the beginning of March. Finally, at the end of 2023, our total net debt was $83 million, down from $134 million in September of 2023. Back to you, Jorge.\nJorge Alberto Ganoza: Thank you, operator. We can now open the room for Q&A.",

It\u2019s come a long way.\nLawyer and investment banker James Rickards has long been bullish on gold. He previously forecasted that gold would reach $15,000 per ounce. Now, he's raising that prediction to an even more optimistic figure.\n\u201cMy latest forecast is that gold may actually exceed $27,000,\u201d Rickards wrote in a recent column. \u201cI don\u2019t say that to get attention or to shock people. It\u2019s not a guess; it\u2019s the result of rigorous analysis.\u201d\nBehind the numbers\nTo establish a price prediction for gold, Rickards posed a straightforward question: \u201cWhat\u2019s the implied non-deflationary price of gold under a new gold standard?\u201d\nHe explained that in a system in which dollars are freely exchangeable for gold at a fixed price, if gold price is too high, it will lead to investors selling gold for dollars and spending \u201cfreely.\u201d Conversely, if gold price is too low, investors will \u201cline up to redeem dollars for gold and then hoard the gold.\u201d\nRickards highlighted that the U.S. M1 money supply is $17.9 trillion and assumed that maintaining confidence would require a 40% gold backing. He argued that this percentage was the legal requirement for the U.S. Federal Reserve from 1913 to 1946.\nHe then calculated that applying the 40% ratio to the $17.9 trillion money supply would require the U.S. to hold $7.2 trillion worth of gold.\nAccording to the World Gold Council, the U.S. has 8,133 tonnes of gold reserves, or 261.5 million troy ounces. And that leads Rickards to the final step of his calculation.\n\u201cApplying the $7.2 trillion valuation to 261.5 million troy ounces yields a gold price of $27,533 per ounce,\u201d he wrote.\nA price tag of $27,533 for one ounce of gold would imply a staggering upside of more than 1,000%, relative to where the precious metal sits today.",

(NYSE:HBM) stands against the other Canadian stocks under $20.\nWhat\u2019s Happening in the Canadian Stock Market?\nThe Canadian economy is beginning to settle down as inflation is on a steady downward trend and the Bank of Canada has also taken an easier policy stance, thereby paving the way for stronger economic growth moving forward. On July 19, Reuters reported that the Bank of Canada cut its overnight interest rates by 25 basis points to 4.5% based on the expectation that inflation will continue to fall.\nInflation rates in Canada cooled a little more than expected making interest rate cuts more likely. On July 16, as per Reuters, June 2024 Consumer Price Index (CPI) cooled down to 2.7% a 0.1% decrease month-over-month thereby paving the way for an interest rate cut.\nAs a result of the interest rate cut, the Canadian stock market was seen performing better. On August 16, Reuters reported that the Canadian stock index ended higher on Friday and witnessed its biggest weekly advance of the year. Investors globally have been cheering the recent signs of the US economic resilience and the recent record high gold prices also boosted the mining sector\nThe S&P/TSK composite index ended up 0.1% at 23,054.61, posting a seven-day gain streak, recorded as the longest daily winning streak since April 2023.\nLooking at a sectoral analysis, the materials group that comprises metal minerals and fertilizer companies was up 1.5% as the price of gold went up by 2% to an all-time high. Moreover, the financial market, which contributed 29% to TSK weighting, grew by 0.6%. The energy sector was a drag, however, and fell 1.1% due to lower oil prices, which settled at $76.65 1.9% lower than expected. The weaker price of oil was mainly attributed to slower demand from China.\nOn August 13, Ross Healy, chairman of Strategic Analysis Corporation and portfolio manager at MacNicol & Associates Asset Management, appeared on Bloomberg to discuss the performance of TSK and the US stock market. Ross Healy, mentioned that the Canadian stock market is trading at 1.5 times its adjusted book value, whereas the NASDAQ is trading at 9.5 times its book value. Mentioning these numbers Ross Healy, stated that for investors looking to invest for 5 years or longer, the Canadian stock market looks more lucrative due to its potential for growth and the portfolio of stocks it has to offer.\nRoss Healy, further believes that we have had a long US advantage and now the market is heading towards a Canadian advantage. Moreover, the precious metal and gold options in the TSK index make the market poised for growth in the long term. Ross Healy, while stating his bull case for gold companies mentioned that companies that have good money on their balance sheets and have been able to find underdeveloped projects to work on have been successful when compared to their competitors.\nOur Methodology\nTo compile the list of 7 best Canadian stocks under $20 we used the Finviz screener. We used the screener to filter out Canadian Stocks that were trading under $20 and sorted them by their market capitalization to get a consolidated list of stocks. Next, we ranked these stocks based on the average price target upside as per Wall Street analysts. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the average price target upside, as of August 18. Moreover, we have also mentioned the share price of each stock as of August 18, 2024.\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nAn aerial view of a copper mine, showing the intricate workings of heavy machinery.\nAverage Price Target Upside as of August 18: 47.84%\nShare Price as of August 18: $7.73\nHudbay Minerals Inc. (NYSE:HBM) operates as a mining company in North and South America. The company mainly focuses on the exploration, development, and mining of different materials. It operates through three main business segments: Copper Production, Zinc Production, and Gold and Silver Production.\nHudbay Minerals Inc. (NYSE:HBM) acts as a raw material provider for numerous industries including renewable energy technologies, electronics, and construction materials. The company has mines in important geographical locations including Peru, Manitoba, and British Columbia, and sells its products to the international market and global manufacturers.\nThe company posted a robust second quarter of 2024, despite facing production challenges. During the second quarter, Hudbay Minerals Inc. (NYSE:HBM) produced 28.6-kilo tons of copper, 58.6 kilo ounces of gold, 738.7 kilo ounces of Silver, and 8.1 kilo tons of Zinc. All the segments showed considerable improvement from a year ago except for Zinc, which decreased 7.95% year-over-year. However, the production of copper increased by 31.8%, gold increased by 33.1%, and silver improved by 20.6% year-over-year.\nThis strong production growth resulted in the company making $425.52 million in revenue up 36.31% year-over-year. While the revenue generation capacity of the company is impressive, what\u2019s more notable is its cash-making ability. Hudbay Minerals Inc. (NYSE:HBM) generated $30 million in free cash flow and continued its trend of positive cash flow over the last 12 months. As a result, the company ended the quarter on a strong financial footing with more than $524 million in cash and cash equivalents.\nShould you invest in Hudbay Minerals Inc. (NYSE:HBM)?\nHudbay Minerals Inc. (NYSE:HBM) can be a good investment stating the company has grown its revenue by 16% during the past 10 years. Moreover, the company is on track to achieve its production targets for the year and has also achieved new milestones in terms of improving its consolidated cash cost. For instance, the cash cost improved to $1.14 per pound of copper during the quarter, leading to an improvement in cash cost guidance to a range of $0.90 to $1.10 per pound.\nHBM is cheap at current levels, it is trading at 14 times its forward earnings, which is an 11% discount to its sector. 14 analysts have a Strong Buy rating on the stock, with their 12-month median price target of $11.43 presenting an upside of 47.84%% from the current level.\nL1 Long Short Fund stated the following regarding Hudbay Minerals Inc. (NYSE:HBM) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\u201cHudbay Minerals Inc. (NYSE:HBM) (Long +31%) shares rallied over the quarter driven by rising copper and gold prices, as well as strong production results. The company\u2019s first quarter results showed higher gold production and robust operating performance at both its major assets, which exceeded consensus expectations. In addition, the company announced a ~US$400m equity raise to support balance sheet de-leveraging and fund its key growth projects. Hudbay is a mid-tier mining company primarily producing copper, alongside gold and zinc, with its key assets located in Canada and Peru. We are attracted to Hudbay due to our positive medium-term outlook for copper and the company\u2019s strong near-term free cash flow generation. This cash generation potential will allow the company to de-lever and recycle capital back into its highly prospective exploration program and major growth projects, most notably its Copper World project in Arizona.\u201d\nOverall HBM ranks 2nd on our list of the best Canadian stocks under $20. While we acknowledge the potential of HBM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HBM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.",

The current focus of the Company is to enhance the N.I. 43-101 gold deposit defined at the Groete Project to a higher grade lower tonnage resource. The Project was last explored in 2012, which included a drill program that allowed the calculation of an Inferred Mineral Resource of 1.57 million gold equivalent ounces (gold plus copper) within 74 million tonnes, at a grade of 0.66 grams per tonne gold equivalent. A cut-off grade of 0.25 gold equivalent grams per tonne, a gold price of US$1,275 per ounce and copper price of US$3.00 per pound was used in the calculation of the Inferred Mineral Resource.

The objective of the Acquisition is to consolidate ownership of the AGM and establish Galiano as growing gold producer with robust financial strength, owning and operating one of the largest gold mines in West Africa. Upon closing of the Acquisition, the Company will own a 90% interest in the AGM with the Government of Ghana continuing to hold a 10% free-carried interest.\nThe Acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of 2024, pending receipt of customary regulatory approvals in Ghana.\nAsanko Gold Mine JV Key Metrics (100% basis):\nSafety: There were no lost-time injuries and one total recordable injury recorded during the fourth quarter, resulting in 12\u2010month rolling LTI and TRI frequency rates of 0.50 and 1.65 per million employee hours worked, respectively.\nProduction performance: Gold production of 31,947 ounces during the fourth quarter. 2023 annual gold production of 134,077 ounces, exceeding the top end of upward revised guidance of between 120,000 to 130,000 ounces.\nMilling performance: Achieved mill throughput of 1.5 million tonnes (\"Mt\") of ore at a grade of 0.8 grams per tonne (\"g/t\") during the fourth quarter. Metallurgical recovery in Q4 2023 was 84%.

Full year 2023 AISC1 amounted to $1,522/oz, at the lower end of downward revised guidance of between $1,500/oz to $1,600/oz. Q4 2023 AISC1 was elevated as anticipated due to higher sustaining capital expenditures related to Abore waste stripping and implementation of a water treatment system at the tailings storage facility (\"TSF\").\nCash flow generation: The JV generated positive cash flow from operations of $24.1 million and Free Cash Flow1 of $2.3 million during the fourth quarter. Full year 2023 Free Cash Flow1 totaled $48.4 million.\nFinancial performance: Gold revenue of $59.3 million generated from 30,555 gold ounces sold at an average realized price of $1,942/oz during the fourth quarter. Net income of $3.7 million and Adjusted EBITDA1 of $9.0 million during the fourth quarter.\nRestart of mining: Hard rock mining operations at the AGM restarted on October 1, 2023, with waste stripping activities ongoing. The Abore pit remains on track to deliver higher grade ore to the processing plant, as compared to the current stockpile processing, in Q2 2024.\nExploration focus: Infill drilling at Abore, designed to convert inferred Mineral Resources to the indicated Mineral Resource category, and early stage drill testing at the Gyagyatreso prospect were completed. Other 2023 exploration programs included drilling at Midras South to advance the deposit towards a potential maiden Mineral Reserve estimate, and at Nkran to support potential Mineral Resource upgrades. Preliminary exploration work was also undertaken across the AGM's regional greenfields targets \u2013 with focus on the Aburi and Sky Gold concessions.\nRobust liquidity: $138.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, $5.7 million in gold sales receivables, $5.1 million in gold on hand and no debt as of December 31, 2023.\n__________________________ |\n1 See \"8. Non-IFRS measures\" |\nGaliano Highlights:\nConsolidation of AGM JV: On December 21, 2023, the Company announced the execution of the SPA to acquire Gold Fields' 45% interest in the AGM JV.\nStable balance sheet: Cash and cash equivalents of $55.3 million as at December 31, 2023 and no debt.\nEarnings: Net loss of $5.8 million or $0.03 per common share during the fourth quarter, which includes the Company's share of the JV's net earnings for the quarter and a downward fair value adjustment on the Company's preferred shares in the JV.\n\"The AGM continues to perform well, with full year 2023 gold production surpassing the upper end of guidance of between 120,000 to 130,000 ounces,\" stated Matt Badylak, Galiano's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Strong production enabled the mine to continue to generate cash during the fourth quarter despite the planned elevated capital expenditure. With mining operations at the AGM having recommenced during the quarter, Abore is on track to deliver higher grade ore to the processing plant by the second quarter of 2024. Health and safety remain a top priority throughout the organization, and I am encouraged by the progress and execution of safety measures and strategies at the AGM.\nAt the corporate level, I am very pleased with the announcement of our acquisition of Gold Fields' 45% interest in the joint venture. This transaction is transformational for Galiano and provides a strong foundation to grow into a mid-tier gold producer. Galiano closed the quarter with $55 million in cash and no debt, and on a pro forma basis, after closing the acquisition with Gold Fields, the consolidated Galiano group will have approximately $130 million in cash while remaining debt free. The strengthening of our balance sheet will allow us to execute on our self-financed life of mine plan at the AGM, in addition to seeking additional opportunities for long term growth.\"\nAsanko Gold Mine \u2013 Summary of quarterly operational and financial highlights (100% basis)\nAsanko Gold Mine (100% basis) | Q4 2023 | Q3 2023 | Q2 2023 | Q1 2023 | Q4 2022 |\nMining | |||||\nOre mined ('000t) | 22 | - | - | - | - |\nWaste mined ('000t) | 3,415 | - | - | - | - |\nTotal mined ('000t) | 3,437 | - | - | - | - |\nStrip ratio (W:O) | 155.2 | - | - | - | - |\nAverage gold grade mined (g/t) | 0.7 | - | - | - | - |\nMining cost ($/t mined)2 | 4.30 | - | - | - | - |\nOre tonnes trucked ('000 t) | 657 | 695 | 729 | 1,367 | 503 |\nOre transportation cost ($/t trucked) | 6.54 | 6.63 | 5.88 | 5.51 | 6.19 |\nProcessing | |||||\nOre milled ('000t) | 1,486 | 1,573 | 1,457 | 1,566 | 1,518 |\nAverage mill head grade (g/t) | 0.8 | 0.8 | 0.8 | 0.9 | 0.8 |\nAverage recovery rate (%) | 84 | 87 | 85 | 73 | 80 |\nProcessing cost ($/t milled) | 9.94 | 9.69 | 11.01 | 9.78 | 10.06 |\nG&A cost ($/t milled) | 5.55 | 4.16 | 4.68 | 4.09 | 4.20 |\nGold produced (oz) | 31,947 | 35,779 | 33,673 | 32,678 | 34,090 |\nFinancials, costs and cash flow | |||||\nRevenue ($m) | 59.5 | 67.8 | 64.1 | 65.2 | 57.8 |\nGold sold (oz) | 30,555 | 35,522 | 32,912 | 35,174 | 34,202 |\nAverage realized gold price ($/oz) | 1,942 | 1,902 | 1,944 | 1,850 | 1,686 |\nTotal cash costs1 ($/oz) | 1,352 | 1,056 | 1,127 | 1,083 | 1,031 |\nAll-in sustaining costs1 ($/oz) | 2,065 | 1,445 | 1,374 | 1,268 | 1,191 |\nAll-in sustaining margin1 ($/oz) | (123) | 457 | 570 | 582 | 495 |\nAll-in sustaining margin1 ($m) | (3.8) | 16.2 | 18.8 | 20.5 | 16.9 |\nIncome from mine operations ($m) | 8.7 | 23.7 | 24.4 | 24.7 | 19.2 |\nAdjusted net income1 ($m) | 3.7 | 21.3 | 24.4 | 20.6 | 19.6 |\nCash provided by operating activities ($m) | 24.1 | 39.7 | 18.0 | 18.9 | 11.1 |\nFree cash flow1 ($m) | 2.3 | 24.0 | 10.1 | 12.0 | 5.5 |\n2 No unit mining costs in Q1 to Q3 2023 as no tonnes were mined. |\nAsanko Gold Mine \u2013 Financial and operational highlights for the three months and years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (100% basis)\nThree months ended December 31, | Year Ended December 31, | |||\n(All amounts in 000's of US dollars, unless otherwise stated) | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 |\nAsanko Gold Mine (100% basis) | ||||\nFinancial results | ||||\nRevenue | 59,514 | 57,808 | 256,543 | 297,136 |\nIncome from mine operations | 8,675 | 19,167 | 81,483 | 71,653 |\nNet income | 3,664 | 83,712 | 69,940 | 103,223 |\nAdjusted net income1 | 3,664 | 19,627 | 69,940 | 58,058 |\nAdjusted EBITDA1 | 9,020 | 22,810 | 82,899 | 79,248 |\nCash and cash equivalents | 138,655 | 91,271 | 138,655 | 91,271 |\nCash generated from operating activities | 24,058 | 11,135 | 100,720 | 75,479 |\nFree cash flow1 | 2,285 | 5,528 | 48,373 | 43,780 |\nAISC margin1 | (3,758) | 16,930 | 51,787 | 70,664 |\nKey mine performance data | ||||\nGold produced (ounces) | 31,947 | 34,090 | 134,077 | 170,342 |\nGold sold (ounces) | 30,555 | 34,202 | 134,163 | 167,849 |\nAverage realized gold price ($/oz) | 1,942 | 1,686 | 1,908 | 1,767 |\nTotal cash costs ($ per gold ounce sold)1 | 1,352 | 1,031 | 1,148 | 1,157 |\nAISC ($ per gold ounce sold)1 | 2,065 | 1,191 | 1,522 | 1,346 |\nThe AGM produced 31,947 ounces of gold during Q4 2023, as the processing plant achieved milling throughput of 1.5 Mt of ore at a grade of 0.8 g/t with metallurgical recovery averaging 84%.\nProduced 134,163 ounces of gold in 2023, exceeding the upper end of revised 2023 production guidance of between 120,000 to 130,000 ounces as stockpile grades performed better than expected.\nSold 30,555 ounces of gold in Q4 2023 at an average realized gold price of $1,942/oz for total revenue of $59.5 million (including $0.2 million of by-product silver revenue), an increase of $1.7 million from Q4 2022. The increase in revenue quarter-on-quarter was due to a 15% increase in realized gold prices relative to Q4 2022, partly offset by an 11% reduction in sales volumes.\nIncome from mine operations for Q4 2023 totaled $8.7 million compared to $19.2 million in Q4 2022. The decrease in income from mine operations was due to a $10.4 million increase in cost of sales that resulted from a portion of the mill feed including stockpiled ore which had a higher average cost, recognizing a $5.0 million legal provision related to a dispute with a former mining contractor, and recording a $2.3 million provision against supplies inventory. This was partly offset by the $1.7 million increase in revenue described above.\nReported Adjusted EBITDA1 of $9.0 million in Q4 2023 compared to $22.8 million in Q4 2022. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA1 was largely driven by the decrease in income from mine operations described above and favourable foreign exchange movements in Q4 2022.\nTotal cash costs1 in Q4 2023 amounted to $1,352/oz compared to $1,031/oz in Q4 2022. Gold sales volumes decreased by 11% in Q4 2023, which had the effect of increasing fixed costs on a per ounce basis. Additionally, a portion of the mill feed during Q4 2023 included stockpiled ore which had a higher average cost, resulting in higher production costs. The AGM also recorded a $2.3 million provision against supplies inventory during Q4 2023, resulting in a $75/oz increase to total cash costs1.\nAISC1 for Q4 2023 was $2,065/oz compared to $1,191/oz in the comparative period. AISC1 was higher in the current quarter predominately due to the increase in total cash costs per ounce1 described above and higher sustaining capital expenditures ($504/oz increase) to support the restart of mining in Q4 2023 (including pre-stripping activities at Abore), implementation of a water treatment system and additional work completed on a TSF lift.\nThe AGM generated $24.1 million of cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow1 of $2.3 million during Q4 2023. This compares to $11.1 million of cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow1 of $5.5 million during Q4 2022. The decrease in free cash flow1 was primarily due to higher capital spend to support a restart of mining operations.\nGaliano Gold Inc. \u2013 Financial highlights for the three months and years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022\nThree months ended December 31, | Year ended December 31, | |||\n(All amounts in 000's of US dollars, unless otherwise stated) | 2023 | 2022 | 2023 | 2022 |\nGaliano Gold Inc. | ||||\nNet (loss) income | (5,758) | 28,500 | 26,085 | 40,809 |\nNet (loss) income per common share | (0.03) | 0.13 | 0.12 | 0.18 |\nAdjusted net (loss) income1 | (5,758) | (6,010) | 26,085 | 6,299 |\nAdjusted net (loss) income per common share1 | (0.03) | (0.03) | 0.12 | 0.03 |\nAdjusted EBITDA1 | 98 | 8,169 | 26,754 | 28,827 |\nCash and cash equivalents | 55,270 | 56,111 | 55,270 | 56,111 |\nThe Company reported a net loss of $5.8 million in Q4 2023, compared to net income of $28.5 million in Q4 2022. The reduction in net earnings during Q4 2023 was primarily due to a $3.9 million downward fair value adjustment on the Company's preferred shares in the JV and higher general and administrative expenses resulting from an increase in the fair value of cash\u2010settled long\u2010term incentive plan awards linked to the Company's share price.\nNet income was higher in Q4 2022 due to the Company recording its share of the JV's net earnings which amounted to $46.5 million, and included the Company's share of an impairment reversal recorded at the AGM JV. Partly offsetting the higher share of JV net income in Q4 2022 was a $22.2 million downward fair value adjustment on the Company's preferred shares in the JV.\nAdjusted EBITDA1 for Q4 2023 amounted to $0.1 million, compared to $8.2 million in Q4 2022. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA1 was due to a reduction in the Company's attributable interest in the AGM JV's Adjusted EBITDA1 and higher share-based compensation expense in Q4 2023.\nCash used in operating activities in Q4 2023 was $1.6 million, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $0.8 million in Q4 2022. The increase in cash used in operating activities from Q4 2022 to Q4 2023 was largely driven by a positive working capital movement in Q4 2022 due to higher accounts payable and collecting the Company's service fee receivable from the JV.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $55.3 million and no debt.\n2024 AGM Guidance\nThe Company will provide guidance for its consolidated business after closing of the Acquisition.\nThis news release should be read in conjunction with Galiano's Management's Discussion and Analysis and the Audited Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, which are available at www.galianogold.com and filed on SEDAR+. |\n1 Non-IFRS Performance Measures\nThe Company has included certain non-IFRS performance measures in this news release. These non-IFRS performance measures do not have any standardized meaning and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Accordingly, these performance measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Refer to the Non-IFRS Measures section of Galiano's Management's Discussion and Analysis for an explanation of these measures and reconciliations to the Company's and the JV's reported financial results in accordance with IFRS.\nTotal Cash Costs per Gold Ounce\nManagement of the Company uses total cash costs per gold ounce sold to monitor the operating performance of the JV. Total cash costs include the cost of production, adjusted for share-based compensation expense, by-product revenue and production royalties per ounce of gold sold.All-in Sustaining Costs per Gold Ounce and All-in Sustaining Margin\nThe Company has adopted the reporting of \"all-in sustaining costs per gold ounce\" (\"AISC\") as per the World Gold Council's guidance. AISC include total cash costs, corporate overhead expenses, sustaining capital expenditure, sustaining capitalized stripping costs, reclamation cost accretion and lease payments made to and interest expense on the AGM's mining and service lease agreements per ounce of gold sold. Excluded from AISC are one-time severance charges in line with World Gold Council guidance. All-in sustaining margin is calculated by taking the average realized gold price for a period less that period's AISC.EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA provides an indication of the Company's continuing capacity to generate income from operations before taking into account the Company's financing decisions and costs of amortizing capital assets. Accordingly, EBITDA comprises net income (loss) excluding interest expense, interest income, amortization and depletion, and income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA adjusts EBITDA to exclude non-recurring items and to include the Company's interest in the Adjusted EBITDA of the JV. Other companies and JV partners may calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently.Free cash flow\nThe Company believes that in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, the Company and certain investors and analysts use free cash flow to evaluate the JV's performance with respect to its operating cash flow capacity to meet non-discretionary outflows of cash. The presentation of free cash flow is not meant to be a substitute for the cash flow information presented in accordance with IFRS, but rather should be evaluated in conjunction with such IFRS measures. Free cash flow is calculated as cash flows from operating activities of the JV adjusted for cash flows associated with sustaining and non-sustaining capital expenditures and payments made to mining and service contractors for leases capitalized under IFRS 16.Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per common share\nThe Company has included the non-IFRS performance measures of adjusted net income and adjusted net income per common share. Neither adjusted net income nor adjusted net income per share have any standardized meaning and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to other measures presented by other issuers. Adjusted net income excludes certain non-cash items or non-recurring items from net income or net loss to provide a measure which helps the Company and investors to evaluate the results of the underlying core operations of the Company or the JV and its ability to generate cash flows and is an important indicator of the strength of the Company's or the JV's operations and performance of its core business.\nQualified Person\nRichard Miller, P.Eng., Vice President Technical Services with Galiano Gold Inc., is a Qualified Person as defined by Canadian National Instrument 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, and has approved the scientific and technical information contained in this news release.\nAbout Galiano Gold Inc.\nGaliano is focused on creating a sustainable business capable of value creation for all stakeholders through production, exploration and disciplined deployment of its financial resources.

Our diversified top line business has a history of generating leading returns. But in late 2023, we were challenged by the unprecedented production hole for Cobre Panama. We're hopeful that the issues can be resolved, although we've taken a prudent approach to the carrying value of the asset. Despite the issues at Cobre Panama, our business remains robust. We finished the year with no debt at $1.4 billion of cash. Balance of our long-duration business still generates industry-leading cash flow. Top-line business model is fortunately not impacted by industry cost inflation. And in 2023, we generated an 83% adjusted EBITDA margin During the year, we added a number of attractive royalty interests, principally on gold mines and projects in Canada, Chile, Australia and the U.S. Drop in U.S. natural gas prices also allow us to add to our natural gas royalty interests.\nOur shareholders depend on us to allocate capital to operations that treat the environment and the host communities responsibly. The work has resulted in top-level ratings from the ESG agencies. Notably, we're top-ranked in the gold sector and in the broader precious metal by Sustainalytics for 2024. Our objective is to have a sustainable and progressive dividend that's dependable, even involved of times and in 2024, our board, we're proud to increase our dividend for the 17th consecutive year. Investors from our IPO are now achieving a 9.4% yield in U.S. dollars or 12.9% yield in Canadian dollars. Growth outlook for the balance of our business is strong over the next five years. Grade assets keep getting better. Antamina has just sanctioned the capital program that will increase production in an areas considering in ground expansion.\nAnd Agnico Eagle is planning to add underground for our tour to expand output up to 1 million ounces per year. An exciting head of new mine builds. I'm looking forward to new contributions from Tocantinzinho, Greenstone and Salares Norte amongst others that will drive our organic growth through 2028. This outlook is good certainty, two thirds of the production is already under construction. $3.4 billion of capital we have available positions us well to add further assets. Cobre Panama represented roughly 20% of our revenue, and the production halt has seen more than a proportional reduction in our market cap. Prospect of Cobre restarting or an arbitration settlement are all upside optionality from these trading levels. In summary, the outlook for our business is bright.\nOur strategy of maintaining a strong balance sheet has never been more relevant, giving us a large treasury to grow the business at a time when capital for the industry is at scarce. Now, I hand the call over to Sandip.\nSandip Rana: Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. I will begin with Slide 4, which shows how the company performed against the guidance that was issued for 2023. The updated guidance provided by the company for last year was 620,000 to 640,000 total GEOs sold. Of this total, we guided to 480,000 to 500,000 precious metal GEOs, with the balance being from diversified assets. The company ended the year with 607,045 GEOs sold well within the guidance range. We're also within the guidance range for precious metals with 488,109 GEOs sold. The diversified assets, which include our non-precious mining assets and entered assets, resulted in just under 140,000 GEOs sold for the year. Before I get further into the financial results, I wanted to speak about Cobre Panama.\nTurning to Slide 5. Cobre Panama is Franco-Nevada's largest investment and has generated approximately 20% of revenue. Before the halt in production, the mine was operating very well, having successfully completed its expansion to 100 million tonnes per year. We will deliver 28,318 GEOs during fourth quarter and just shy of 129,000 GEOs for the full year. However, as previously disclosed, Cobre Panama has been in preservation and safe management with production halted since November 2023. November 28, 2023, following protest and President Cortizo\u2019s call for a mining moratorium, the Supreme Court of Justice of Panama released its ruling declaring Law 406 unconstitutional. In light of these events, we carried out an impairment assessment of our Cobre Panama streams at December 31, 2023.\nThe recording of impairments is a judgment made by management based on available information at a point in time, which are used to determine the accounting treatment. We took a prudent approach in our judgment of the facts and circumstances and based on the halting of production of political environment surrounding the ruling by the Supreme Court, as well as the significant share price impact, we determine the recoverable amount under applicable accounting standards to be nailed as at December 31, 2023. As a result, we recognized a full noncash impairment loss of approximately $1.2 billion. As previously disclosed, we have provided a notice of intent to commence arbitration against the State of Panama. While we believe in the strength of our claims, the potential proceeds from the arbitration or reflected in our impairment valuation.\nOur streams on Cobre Panama remain valid, and we are hopeful of a resolution between first quantum and the state of Panama and a restart of the mine at which time our deliveries would restart. In this situation, we would assess the recoverable amount of Cobre Panama streams at that point in time, which may lead to a reversal of part or all of the impairment loss we recognized. Moving on to the financial performance for the quarter. On Slide 6, we highlight the gold equivalent ounces sold for the last five quarters as well as the last five years. Total GEOs sold were lower when compared to prior year, with Q4 2023 GEO sold being 152,351 compared to 180,886 in the fourth quarter 2022. Of this, precious metal, GEOs were 119,581, down approximately 8% from prior year.\nFor the quarter, the largest contributors to the lower precious metals were Cobre Panama due to the halt in production, as mentioned, Stillwater, which was due to the impact of converting weaker platinum palladium revenue to GEOs; and Candelaria, which had lower production during the quarter. The lower GEOs from these assets was partially offset by stronger production from both Antapaccay and MWS, both of which had a very strong fourth quarter. Precious metal GEOs represented 79% of total GEOs for the quarter and 78% for the full year. For diversified GEOs, our Vale royalty resulted in an increase in GEOs for the quarter compared to prior due to higher iron ore prices. As you know, each quarter, we make an estimate of what the royalty will be with the actual amount being announced by Vale in late March and September each year.\nAs a result, you will see adjustments to our accruals twice a year in the first and third quarter each year. Energy GEOs were significantly lower at 25,640 GEOs for Q4 compared to 47,713 a year ago. This was the result of lower energy prices, natural gas in particular. 2023 saw continued volatility in commodity prices. As you can see on Slide 7, gold and silver prices were higher for the quarter and year, with gold higher by over 14% for the quarter and almost 8% for the year. Palladium prices were significantly lower year-over-year which did negatively impact the conversion of PGM revenues to GEOs. Energy prices were weaker in '23 coming off multiyear highs from 2022. Slide 8 our total revenue and adjusted EBITDA amounts for the last five quarters.\nAs you can see from the bar charts, the revenue and adjusted EBITDA has decreased slightly Q4 2023 compared to prior year. The company recorded $303.3 million in revenue during the quarter and $254.6 million in adjusted EBITDA. The margin of 83.9% was achieved for the quarter. As you turn to Slide 9, you will see the key financial results for the company. As mentioned, total GEOs were 627,045, generating $1.2 billion in revenue. On the cost side, we did have a slight decrease in cost of sales compared to Q4 2022 due to lower energy costs. Also, cost of sales is dependent on which assets deliver stream ounces as not all fixed payments for stream ounces are equal. Depletion decreased to $68.9 million versus $73.5 million a year ago. Depletion is based on actual mining GEO sold and barrels of oil equivalent received on the energy side of the business.\nAs we received less GEOs from Cobre Panama and Antamina and Candelaria, this impacted depletion as those assets are higher per ounce depletion assets. We did record a net loss for the quarter of $982.5 million or $5.11 per share due to the impairment recorded on Cobre Panama. This compares to net into $165 million or $0.86 per share in the prior year. However, adjusted net income was $172.9 million or $0.90 per share for the quarter, up 5% and 5.8%, respectively, versus prior year. Slide 10 highlights the continued diversification of the portfolio. From the chart, you can see that 78% of our full year 2023 revenue was generated by precious metals, with revenue being sourced 88% from the Americas, with Canada and the United States, the largest.\nSlide 11 illustrates the strength of our business model to generate high margins. For 2023, the cash cost per GEO, which is essentially cost of sales divided by gold equivalent ounces sold, is $286 per GEO. This compares to $242 per GEO in 2022. This amount will fluctuate depending on the mix of royalty versus stream GEOs, including mining and energy. But as you can see, at current average gold prices, the company generates significant margins. Margin was over $1,600 per ounce in 2023. In a rising commodity environment, we expect to benefit fully as the cost per GEO sold should not increase significantly. We consider our cost structure to essentially be fixed. The other cost component for the company besides the cost of sales is our core administration costs.\nThe royalty streaming business model is a scalable model. Our corporate administration costs have increased at a much lower rate than our revenue. Revenue has increased eightfold from 2008, while corporate admin costs has less than doubled over the same period. Management believes we can continue to add to our portfolio and grow our business without adding significant overhead to the company. With respect to guidance going forward, please refer to Slide 13. For 2024, we are guiding to total GEOs sold of between 480,000 to 540,000 GEOs sold. Of this total GEOs, we are guiding to 360,000 to 400,000 precious metals GEOs for the year. The balance would be GEOs from our diversified assets, of which we expect energy to account for about 75% for 2024.\nPlease note that for all guidance ranges, we have excluded Cobre Panama in our GEO sold numbers. At Cobre Panama range in production, we would have expected deliveries and sales of between 130,000 to 150,000 GEOs annually. The overall main drivers for GEOs year-over-year are: for precious metals, we will benefit from initial ounces from new mines being completed in 2024, to Tocantinzinho, Greenstone Mera Rosa and Salares Norte. We will have full year deliveries for Magino and S\u00e9qu\u00e9la, and we expect an increase in GEOs from Candelaria based on the guidance from the operator. However, we are anticipating lower production at Antapaccay based on the mine plan for lower grades. Our guidance has been calculated using $1,950 per ounce gold, $22.50 for silver, $850 for platinum, $900 palladium and $115 per ton 62% iron ore.\nObviously, prices are volatile, and as they change, it will impact the conversion of non-gold commodities to GEOs. Also, please note, we expect to reach our GEO cap by MWS by the end of 2024. On the energy side, we are using a price of $75 per barrel WTI and $2.50 and CF natural gas. This range of 85,000 to 105,000 GEOs from our energy assets. As we look forward over the next few years, we do forecast 2026 as the current high for GEO sold based upon what we know today. Thereafter, we will have the staff ancillary in 2027 and then Antapaccay in 2028. Our outlook for 2028 is 540,000 to 600,000 GEOs sold. Of this range, metals will be 385,000 to 425,000 GEOs. Main contributors will be higher production from Antamina and Guadalupe based on latest mine plans.\nNew mine starts from Valentine Gold, Stibnite Gold, Eskay Creek and Castle Mountain Phase 2. For diversified GEOs, we do expect increasing GEOs from our Vale royalty as attributable production should increase with the royalty on the Southeast system becoming payable. For the energy assets, we do assume an increase in production over the next five years, resulting in increasing. Also, we have held energy prices flat at $75 a barrel WTI and $2.50 Mcf of natural gas for the period. Overall, when you look at the outlook for GEO sold, the company has approximately 15% built-in organic growth from 2023 to 2028 at budgeted commodity prices, excluding Cobre Panama. This also assumes that no additional assets are added to the portfolio. Two additional items to note.\nWith the legal proceedings that we will move forward related to Cobre Panama, we are expecting to incur annual costs of between $10 million to $15 million per year. These costs will be disclosed separately in our financials going forward. And with the proposed implementation of the global minimum tax, sometime in 2024, we are projecting that our effective tax rate will increase to approximately 18% to 19% going forward. The global minimum tax will be retroactive to January 1, 2024. The effective tax rate will actuate based on the jurisdictions that generate tax for income. And lastly, Slide 14 summarizes the financial resources available to the company, including our credit facility of $1 billion, total available capital at December 31, 2023, is $2.4 billion.\nAnd now I'll pass it over to Alura, and we are happy to answer any questions.",

One of the most popular items recently, though, is gold bullion. Of the 101 stores that Bloomberg surveyed earlier this month, 77% reported that they had sold out of bars of the yellow metal.\nBut buying bullion only will translate to growth in your investment if the price of gold rises -- something that is far from a sure thing. Investors looking to gain gold exposure, on the other hand, would be better off loading up on a dividend-paying gold stock. Fortunately for them, AgnicoEagleMines(NYSE: AEM), CenterraGold(NYSE: CGAU), and Franco-Nevada(NYSE: FNV) are three top dividend-paying gold stocks that look especially lustrous right now.\nAgnico Eagle offers a conservative approach to the yellow stuff\nWith a history spanning more than 60 years, Agnico Eagle has emerged as one of the leading gold producers available to investors. It operates a sizable portfolio of 11 assets located in four countries, and forecasts gold production of approximately 3.45 million ounces in 2024. It has made solid progress toward achieving this guidance, reporting gold production of 1.8 million ounces through the first half of the year. The future seems bright as well, with about 54 million gold ounces of proven and probable reserves.\nAgnico Eagle has paid a dividend for 41 consecutive years, demonstrating a strong commitment to rewarding shareholders. Should it pay a dividend of $1.60 per share in 2024 as management expects, the company will have hiked its dividend at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 23% since it paid $0.03 per share in 2005. Investors who pick up Agnico Eagle stock and its 2% forward-yielding dividend can rest easy knowing that the company isn't imperiling its financial health to reward shareholders. Agnico Eagle has an investment grade balance sheet, and its payout ratio has averaged 64% over the past five years.\nYour passive income stream can gleam with Centerra Gold\nWith a market capitalization of $1.5 billion, Centerra Gold may not be one of the largest gold stocks on the market. But what it lacks in size regarding market cap, it makes up for with its payout -- one of the most alluring dividends among its gold stock peers, with a forward yield of 2.9%. Adding to the stock's appeal right now is the fact that it's currently sitting in the bargain bin. Currently, shares of Centerra are valued at 4.3 times operating cash flow, a discount to their five-year average cash flow multiple of 5.6.\nLike Agnico Eagle, Centerra is operating from a position of considerable financial strength. Whereas many gold producers rely heavily on leverage in order to develop their metal-producing assets, Centerra maintains a solid balance sheet which currently features zero debt and $592 million in cash on hand.\nThe company has two core projects in its portfolio: Mount Milligan and Oksut. But Centerra has several irons in the fire, positioning it for growth. Most notably, it plans on growing its molybdenum business by ramping up operations at its Langeloth molybdenum conversion facility. Management expects that when Langeloth achieves production capacity (about 40 million pounds annually), it will generate about $50 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) per year.\nFranco-Nevada offers a unique approach to gold investment\nFor a slightly different approach to gaining gold exposure, investors may want to consider Franco-Nevada, a royalty and streaming company. By acting like specialized financiers, royalty and streaming companies provide gold mining companies with upfront capital for developing assets. In return, the royalty and streaming companies receive a percentage of the mine's sales, or the right to purchase the future production of a metal from a mine for a agreed-upon price.\nFranco-Nevada has a formidable portfolio with interests in 432 projects. While 118 of these projects are currently in production, 38 projects are in the advance phase of development, and 276 are in the exploration phase, so there is a robust pipeline of growth projects. These projects represent a variety of commodities, from precious metals to oil and gas to platinum group metals. But it's gold that represents the company's bread and butter. In the second quarter of 2024, for example, gold accounted for 61% of the company's revenue. Oil was the second greatest contributor to quarterly revenue, accounting for 14% of sales.\nFranco-Nevada's dividend currently provides a modest forward yield of 1.2%. While it's not as generous as that of Centerra or Agnico Eagle, it's better than the non-existent dividend investors who buy bullion receive. Moreover, the company's commitment to rewarding shareholders is clear. It has raised its payout for 17 consecutive years, suggesting that future dividend raises are likely.\nShould you add some glitter to your portfolio with these gold stocks right now?\nFor those interested in diversifying their portfolios with a gold investment, buying bullion at Costco isn't the best option, since those gold bars will only prove to be successful investments if the price of gold continues to rise. Instead, investors would be better off buying shares of dividend payers Agnico Eagle and Centerra -- though the latter may appeal to those looking for a stock hanging on the discount rack. For the most conservative of investors, Franco-Nevada is a better option, as it's not exposed to the risks of developing assets like gold-producing companies are.\nShould you invest $1,000 in Agnico Eagle Mines right now?\nBefore you buy stock in Agnico Eagle Mines, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Agnico Eagle Mines wasn\u2019t one of them.

Experience in Australia, New Zealand, as well as the UK, relating to traditional tobacco products, shows significant declines in smoking rates in line with tax increases.\nBut in a forthright response to the Budget from the Instiute of Economic Affairs, Christopher Snowdon, a lifestyle economics specialist, said:\nThis is a deeply cynical cash grab from the Chancellor.

This doubles period over which taper works so cuts marginal tax rates.\u201d\n01:44 PM GMT\nHunt to abolish levy on oil and gas profits\nDuring the Budget, Mr Hunt said he wanted to \u201cencourage investment in the North Sea so we will retain generous investment allowances for the sector\u201d.\nHe extended the oil and gas windfall tax for one more year, but said that the Energy Profits Levy would be abolished \u201cshould market prices fall to their historic norm for a sustained period of time\u201d.\n01:39 PM GMT\nNational Insurance cut to get 200,000 more people in work\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt confirmed a further 2p National Insurance cut, from 10pc to 8pc from April 6, with self-employed National Insurance being slashed from 8pc to 6pc.\n01:39 PM GMT\nHunt attacks Labour on the economy\nJeremy Hunt finished the Budget with a robust attack on the Labour Party\u2019s economic policies. He said:\nWe stick to our plan with a Budget for Long Term Growth. It delivers more investment. More jobs. Better public services. And lower taxes.\n01:38 PM GMT\n\u2018Effective\u2019 personal taxes lower than America, France or Germany, claims Hunt\nJeremy Hunt said that the \u201ceffective\u201d personal tax rates are now lower than any other G7 country. He said:\nThe OBR say, when combined with the autumn reduction, our National Insurance cuts will mean the equivalent of 200,000 more people in work \u2013 filling one in five vacancies and adding 0.4pc to our GDP and 0.4pc to our GDP per head.\n01:36 PM GMT\nNational Insurance cut\nNational Insurance (NI) is being cut for employees by another 2p, from 10pc to 8pc.\nSelf-employed NI will drop form 8pc to 6pc.\nMr Hunt said:\nIt means an additional \u00a3450 a year for the average employee or \u00a3350 for someone self-employed. When combined with the autumn reductions, it means 27 million employees will get an average tax cut of \u00a3900 a year and two million self-employed a tax cut averaging \u00a3650. Changes that make our system simpler and fairer. And changes that grow our economy by rewarding work.\n01:33 PM GMT\nChild benefit charge threshold raised to \u00a360,000\nThe way that the Government treats child benefit in the tax system is \u201cconfusing and unfair\u201d, Mr Hunt claimed. He said:\nIt\u2019s a lifeline for many parents because it helps with the additional costs associated with having children. And when it works, it\u2019s good for children, it\u2019s good for parents, and it\u2019s good for the economy because it helps people into work.\n01:31 PM GMT\nAbolishing non-dom status will raise \u00a32.7bn a year, says Chancellor\nThe Chancellor said that non-doms can make a significant contribution to the economy, so he said he would \u201cput in place transitional arrangements for those benefitting from the current regime\u201d. He added:\nThat will include a two-year period in which individuals will be encouraged to bring wealth earned overseas to the UK where it can be spent and invested here \u2013 a measure that will attract onshore an additional \u00a315bn of foreign income and gains and generate more than \u00a31bn of extra tax.\n01:30 PM GMT\nChancellor replaces \u2018non-dom\u2019 tax regime\nThe Chancellor is changing the tax regime for non-doms. He said:\nFrom April 2025, new arrivals to the UK will not be required to pay any tax on foreign income and gains for their first four years of UK residency, a more generous regime than at present and one of the most attractive offers in Europe.\n01:27 PM GMT\nChancellor abolishes Multiple Dwellings Relief\nJeremy Hunt has abolished Multiple Dwellings Relief, which was supposed to increase investment in the private rented sector. He said:\nI have also been looking at the stamp duty relief for people who purchase more than one dwelling in a single transaction, known as Multiple Dwellings Relief. [It was] intended to support investment in the private rented sector.\n01:26 PM GMT\nChanges to how holiday lettings are taxed\nJeremy Hunt said that he had been looking at the Furnished Holiday Lettings tax regime. He said:\nI am concerned that this tax regime is creating a distortion, meaning that there are not enough properties available for long-term rental by local people. So, to make the tax system work better for local communities, I am going to abolish the Furnished Holiday Lettings regime.\n01:26 PM GMT\nCamilla Tominey: Hunt\u2019s jibes at Labour come as tax burden hits historic high\n01:25 PM GMT\nMore resources for tax collectors\nHe said that the Government will raise more tax revenues by giving HMRC more resources.\n01:24 PM GMT\nTax hike on business class flights\nJeremy Hunt sounds like he\u2019s hiking taxes on business class flights. He said:\nI will make a one-off adjustment to rates of Air Passenger Duty on non-economy flights only to account for high inflation in recent years.\n01:23 PM GMT\nLower taxed economies have \u2018more energy\u2019\nJeremy Hunt made a moral case for lower taxes:\nWe believe that in a free society the money you earn doesn\u2019t belong to the government. It belongs to you.\n01:22 PM GMT\nNew special educational needs schools to be created\nMr Hunt pledged \u00a3105m over the next four years to build 15 new special free schools \u201cto create additional high quality places and increase choice for parents\u201d.\n01:22 PM GMT\nHunt announces plan to improve public sector productivity\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt said there is a need for a \u201cmore productive state not a bigger state\u201d as he launched his public sector productivity plan. He said:\nI am keeping the planned growth in day-to-day spending at 1pc in real terms. But we are going to spend it better.\nOn the NHS, Mr Hunt said the systems that support its staff are \u201coften antiquated\u201d before adding on the long-term workforce plan: \u201cI wanted better care for patients, better value for taxpayers and more rewarding work for its staff. Making changes on the scale we need is not cheap. The investment needed to modernise NHS IT systems so they are as good as the best in the world costs \u00a33.4bn.\nThe move has been welcomed by economists:\n01:21 PM GMT\nGovernment pledges cash to fight knife crimes\nMr Hunt said that the Government was spending money to target knife crime and increase police response times. He said:\nViolence Reduction Units and hot spot policing have prevented an estimated 136,000 knife crimes and other violent offences as well as over 3,000 hospital admissions since funding began in 2019.\n01:20 PM GMT\nChancellor claims NHS England boss is supportive of Government\u2019s spending\nJeremy Hunt said that the official who runs NHS England is supportive of the level of spending the Government is giving to the NHS. He said:\nThe head of the NHS Amanda Pritchard today says that this investment shows the Government continues to back the NHS. She says that, as a result of it, the NHS can commit to delivering 1.9pc annual labour productivity growth over the next parliament, more than double the average productivity growth in public services between 2010 and 2019.\n01:19 PM GMT\nKatie Morley: Isas devil will be in the detail after past \u2018stringent\u2019 restrictions\nOur consumer champion Katie Morley outlines what to look out for with the new British Isa:\n01:18 PM GMT\nHunt gives NHS an extra \u00a32.5bn to help cut waiting lists\nMr Hunt said that he would spend an additional \u00a32.5bn on the NHS in the coming year. He said:\nThis will allow the NHS to continue its focus on reducing waiting times and brings the total increase in NHS funding to 13pc in real terms.\n01:17 PM GMT\nHunt spends on NHS IT\nJeremy Hunt increases the amount of cash the NHS is spending on technology, including artificial intelligence. He said:\nWe will slash the 13 million hours lost by doctors and nurses every year to outdated IT systems.\n01:16 PM GMT\nHunt spends on NHS productivity\nThe Chancellor is spending money on the modernisation of NHS IT systems to raise productivity. He said:\nWhen we published the NHS Long Term Workforce Plan, I asked the NHS to put together a plan to transform its efficiency and productivity.\n01:16 PM GMT\nGB Isa \u2018crucial step\u2019 for British businesses\nMike O\u2019Shea, the chief executive of Premier Miton Investors, said:\nWe\u2019re pleased the Chancellor and the Government have announced the introduction of the Great British Isa in the Budget statement today.\n01:14 PM GMT\n\u2018Antiquated\u2019 systems and form-filling damaging NHS\nThe Chancellor said:\nThe NHS is, rightly, the biggest reason most of us are proud to be British.\n01:13 PM GMT\nNot fair to ask taxpayers to pay more when public sector productivity is so low, says Hunt\nMr Hunt is introducing a Public Sector Productivity Plan:\nIt\u2019s not fair to ask taxpayers to pay for more when public service productivity has fallen. Nor would it be wise to reduce that funding given the pressures that public services face. So I am keeping the planned growth in day to day spending at 1pc in real terms. But we are going to spend it better.\n01:12 PM GMT\nPension regulator to get powers to ensure \u2018better value\u2019 for investors\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt said new powers will be given to the Pensions Regulator and Financial Conduct Authority to ensure \u201cbetter value\u201d from defined contribution schemes by \u201cjudging performance on overall returns not cost\u201d.\nHe said:\nBut I remain concerned that other markets such as Australia generate better returns for pension savers with more effective investment strategies and more investment in high quality domestic growth stocks.\nMr Hunt said he will proceed with a retail sale for part of the Government\u2019s remaining NatWest shares this summer at the earliest, subject to market conditions and value for money.\n01:12 PM GMT\nPublic sector productivity is too low\nJeremy Hunt has raised the problem of public sector productivity:\nAlthough spending has continued to rise every year, public sector productivity remains below pre-pandemic levels \u2013 by nearly 6pc. This demonstrates that the way to improve public services is not always more money or more people \u2013 we also need to run them more efficiently.\n01:12 PM GMT\nChancellor bigs up the Government\u2019s record\nJeremy Hunt is talking about public services:\nBurglaries and violent crime have halved over the last 14 years and we invested in 20,000 more police officers. Our Armed Forces remain the most professional and best funded in Europe, with defence spending already more than 2pc of GDP. We are providing more military support to Ukraine than nearly any other country and our spending will rise to 2.5pc as soon as economic conditions allow.\n01:10 PM GMT\nChancellor \u2018guarantees\u2019 rates to childcare providers\nMr Hunt said that a year ago he announced the \u201cbiggest ever expansion of childcare\u201d. He added:\nToday, in order to support the childcare sector make the new investments it now needs, I am guaranteeing the rates that will be paid to childcare providers to deliver our landmark offer for children over nine months old for the next two years.\n01:10 PM GMT\nFuel duty subsidy runs \u2018counter\u2019 to net zero goals, says economist\nBen Caswell, a NIESR senior economist, said:\nThe Chancellor has decided to extend the 5p cut in fuel duty for a further 12 months.\n01:09 PM GMT\n\u2018Those who can work should\u2019\nIt would be wrong to fill Britain\u2019s vacancies with just immigration, said Mr Hunt:\nOne of the biggest barriers to investment is businesses not being able to hire the staff they need. The economy today has around 900,000 vacancies. It would be easy to fill them with higher migration \u2013 but with over 10 million adults of working age not in work that would be economically and morally wrong.\n01:08 PM GMT\nMillions for Cancer Research UK\nJeremy Hunt pledged \u00a345m cash for medical charities into diseases such as dementia, cancer and epilepsy. He is giving \u00a33m to Cancer Research UK.\n01:07 PM GMT\nTax relief for culture\nIn a measure aimed at orchestras, museums, galleries and theatres that is apparently backed by Lord Lloyd Webber, Mr Hunt said:\nIn the pandemic we introduced a higher 45pc and 50pc level of tax relief which were due to end in March 2025. It has been a lifeline for performing arts across the country. Today in recognition of their vital importance to our national life I can announce I am making those tax reliefs permanent at 45pc for touring and orchestral productions and 40pc for non-touring productions.\n01:06 PM GMT\nPinewood a winner from the Budget\nMr Hunt continued the benefits to the film industry, saying:\nHaving worked closely with the Culture Secretary and listened carefully to representations from companies like Pinewood, Warner Brothers and Sky Studios, we will provide eligible film studios in England with 40% relief on their gross business rates until 2034.\nHe also pledged \u00a326m for the National Theatre to improve its stages.\n01:05 PM GMT\nBigger tax benefits of TV and film industry\nMr Hunt said he will \u201cincrease the rate of tax credit by 5pc and remove the 80pc cap for visual effects costs in the Audio-Visual Expenditure Credit\u201d.\n01:04 PM GMT\n\u00a3120m more to the Green Industries Growth Accelerator\nThe Chancellor pledged the cash to \u201cbuild supply chains for new technology ranging from offshore wind to carbon capture and storage\u201d.\n01:04 PM GMT\nGovernment to push ahead with small nuclear power stations advocated by Rolls-Royce\nJeremy Hunt recommitted to Small Modular Reactors. He said:\nWe want nuclear to provide up to a quarter of our electricity by 2050. As part of that, I want the UK to lead the global race in developing cutting-edge nuclear technologies. I can therefore announce that Great British Nuclear will begin the next phase of the Small Modular Reactor selection process, with companies now having until June to submit their initial tender responses.\n01:02 PM GMT\nGreat British Isa will take place\nThe Great British Isa is going to happen, Mr Hunt said:\nI will reform the Isa system to encourage more people to invest in UK assets. After a consultation on its implementation, I will introduce a brand new British Isa which will allow an additional \u00a35,000 annual investment for investments in UK equity with all the tax advantages of other Isas.\n01:02 PM GMT\n\u2018Tell Sid\u2019 NatWest sale pledged\nMr Hunt said:\nWe will proceed with a retail sale for part of the Government\u2019s remaining NatWest shares this summer at the earliest, subject to supportive market conditions and value for money.\n01:02 PM GMT\nCamilla Tominey: Prominent backbenchers lobbied Hunt to do more for businesses\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt has announced the VAT registration threshold will be increased from \u00a385,000 to \u00a390,000 from the start of April, saying it would help \u201ctens of thousands of businesses\u201d.\nOur associate editor Camilla Tominey has this context to the decision:\n01:01 PM GMT\nHunt wants more stock market support of Britain\u2019s Silicon Valley\nJeremy Hunt addressed the problem that it\u2019s difficult for technology companies to gain investment from the London markets. He said:\nI want our brilliant technology entrepreneurs not just to start here but to stay here, including when the time comes for a stock market listing. So we will build on the Edinburgh and Mansion House reforms to unlock more pension fund capital. We will give new powers to The Pensions Regulator and Financial Conduct Authority to ensure better value from Defined Contribution schemes by judging performance on overall returns not cost...\n12:59 PM GMT\nChancellor wants Cambridge to be \u2018world\u2019s leading scientific powerhouse\u2019\nJeremy Hunt spoke about Cambridge - home of the global microprocessor giant. He said:\nI am pleased to announce the next steps for Cambridge to reach its potential to be the world\u2019s leading scientific powerhouse. I confirm there will be a long-term funding settlement for the future Development Corporation in Cambridge at the next spending review, with over \u00a310m invested in the coming year to unlock delivery of crucial local transport and health infrastructure.\n12:58 PM GMT\nMore money for nations outside England\nMr Hunt said he was increasing money for parts of the country outside England. He said:\nAs a result of the decisions we take today, the Scottish Government will receive nearly \u00a3300m in Barnett consequentials, with nearly \u00a3170m for the Welsh Government and \u00a3100m for the Northern Ireland Executive.\n12:57 PM GMT\nMoney pledged for \u2018levelling up\u2019\nMr Hunt promised more cash for levelling up. He said:\n[We are] allocating \u00a3100m of levelling up funding to areas including High Peak, Dundee, Conwy, Erewash, Redditch and Coventry to support cultural projects in these communities, alongside support for capital projects across the country including in Bingley ...\n12:55 PM GMT\nNew \u2018levelling up\u2019 measures announced\nMr Hunt said that he would push ahead with economic devolution, following the creation of 13 investment zones and 12 freeports:\nI can announce the North-East trailblazer devolution deal, providing a package of support for the region potentially worth over \u00a3100m.\n12:54 PM GMT\nCamilla Tominey: Quite a lot of banter in the Commons\nOur associate editor Camilla Tominey has this insight on the atmosphere inside the Commons chamber.\n12:53 PM GMT\nVAT threshold raised\nMore microbusinesses will be exempt from having to register for VAT. Mr Hunt said:\nI will reduce the administrative and financial impact of VAT by increasing the VAT registration threshold from \u00a385,000 to \u00a390,000 from April 1st \u2013 the first increase in seven years. This will bring tens of thousands of businesses out of paying VAT altogether and encourage many more to invest and grow.\n12:52 PM GMT\nHunt takes \u2018further steps to boost investment\u2019\nHe said that Full Expensing, confirmed as a permanent policy last autumn, was welcomed by over 200 business leaders. He said he now wanted to extend this idea further:\nToday I take further steps to boost investment. Having listened to calls from the CBI and Make UK, we will shortly publish draft legislation for full expensing to apply to leased assets, a change I intend to bring in as soon as it is affordable. We will also help small businesses, something close to my own heart.\n12:51 PM GMT\nBusiness investment is going up, says Hunt\nMr Hunt referred to investments by Nissan, Microsoft and Google, saying that investment is going up under the Conservatives:\nEconomists say that stimulating investment is the most effective way to raise productivity. Since 2010, we have been doing just that. Business investment has risen from an average of 9.3pc of GDP under Labour to 9.9pc under the Conservatives. This year it will be 10.6pc of GDP \u2013 generating \u00a330bn more in business investment than if it had continued at Labour levels. And it is still going up.\n12:50 PM GMT\nUK debt pile \u2018very similar\u2019 to Autumn Statement\nOur economics editor Szu Ping Chan says:\n12:50 PM GMT\n\u2018They don\u2019t have a growth plan\u2019\nJeremy Hunt claimed that Labour \u201cdon\u2019t have a growth plan\u201d. He said:\nInflation has halved ... Debt is falling in line with our fiscal rules ... And growth is fully 1.5 percentage points higher than predicted.\n12:49 PM GMT\nHunt justifies Government\u2019s economic record\nJeremy Hunt bigged up the Government\u2019s economy record. He said:\nSince 2010, we have grown faster than Germany, France and Italy, the three largest European economies, and, according to the IMF, we will continue to grow faster than all three of them in the next five years as well. Surveys by Lloyds and Deloitte show business confidence is returning. In other words, because we have turned the corner on inflation, we will soon turn the corner on growth.\n12:48 PM GMT\nHunt attacks Labour\u2019s green policies\nMr Hunt took aim at Labour\u2019s pledge to \u201cdecarbonise\u201d faster than the Government, saying it would prevent borrowing from being cut. He said:\nNone of that would be possible if Labour implemented their pledge to decarbonise the grid five years early by 2030. Their own calculations said that costs \u00a328bn a year to do. But last month, after flipflopping for months and months, they said they\u2019re not going to spend the \u00a328bn after all\u2026but somehow they will meet their pledge. Somehow, Madam Deputy Speaker, that can only mean one thing: tax rises on working families.\n12:48 PM GMT\n\u2018Yet another fuel duty freeze\u2019\n12:47 PM GMT\nGovernment \u2018bringing down borrowing so we can start to reduce our debt\u2019\nJeremy Hunt said the government continues to have the second-lowest level of government debt in the G7. He claimed that this was lower than Japan, France and the United States. He said:\nAhead of my first Autumn Statement in 2022, the OBR forecast headline debt would rise to above 100pc of GDP. Today they say it will fall in every year to just 94.3pc by 2028-29. Underlying debt, which excludes Bank of England debt, will be 91.7pc in 2024-25 according to the OBR, then 92.8pc, 93.2pc, 93.2pc before falling to 92.9pc in 2028-29 with final year headroom against debt falling of \u00a38.9bn. Our underlying debt is therefore on track to fall as a share of GDP, meeting our fiscal rule.\n12:45 PM GMT\nHunt justifies spending restraint\nMr Hunt said there was no disconnect between spending restrictions and being compassionate. He said:\nAn economy based on sound money does not pass on its bills to the next generation. When it comes to borrowing, some believe there is a trade off between compassion and fiscal responsibility. They are wrong. It is only because we responsibly reduced the deficit by 80pc between 2010 and 2019 that we could provide \u00a3370bn to help families and businesses in the pandemic.\n12:44 PM GMT\nFuel and alcohol duty freezes will cut inflation, Hunt says\nJeremy Hunt said that duty freezes would help inflation. He said:\n[The fuel duty cut] will save the average car driver \u00a350 next year and bring total savings since the 5p cut was introduced to around \u00a3250.\n12:43 PM GMT\nHunt freezes fuel duty for 12 months\nJeremy Hunt says that he will freeze fuel duty:\nAnother cost that families and businesses worry about is fuel. The shadow chancellor complained about the freeze on fuel duty and Labour has opposed it at every opportunity. The Labour Mayor of London wants to punish motorists even more with his ULEZ plans. But lots of families and sole traders depend on their car. If I did nothing fuel duty would increase by 13pc this month.\n12:42 PM GMT\nAlcohol duty is frozen\nMr Hunt said:\nI have decided to extend the alcohol duty freeze until February 2025. This benefits 38,000 pubs all across the UK \u2013 and on top of the \u00a313,000 saving a typical pub will get from the 75% business rates discount I announced in the Autumn. We value our hospitality industry and we are backing the great British pub.\n12:42 PM GMT\nChancellor extends household support fund\nJeremy Hunt has extended the Household Support Fund that the Government says is \u201caimed at anyone who\u2019s vulnerable or cannot pay for essentials\u201d. Mr Hunt explained:\nIt was set up on a temporary basis and due to conclude at the end of this month. Having listened carefully to representations from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the Trussell Trust and the Hon Members for East Ham, Colchester, Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner and Suffolk Coastal among others, I have decided that \u2013 with the battle against inflation still not over \u2013 now is not the time to stop the targeted help it offers. We will therefore continue it at current levels for another six months.\n12:41 PM GMT\nChancellor abolishes charge for debt relief order\nThe Chancellor is abolishing a charge made for people who want to use a scheme to get out of debt:\nFor some people the best way to resolve debts is through a debt relief order. But getting one costs \u00a390, which can deter the very people who need them the most. So having listened carefully to representations from Citizens Advice, I today relieve pressure on around 40,000 families every year by abolishing that \u00a390 charge completely.\n12:40 PM GMT\nChancellor promises to help poorer households\nThe Chancellor is making a change to advance loans for people on Universal Credit:\nThe OBR predicted real household disposable income per person would fall by 2% in the last year \u2013 instead after this support it is on track to rise by 0.8%. Today I take further steps to help families with cost-of-living pressures starting with measures to help the poorest families. We have already abolished higher charges for electricity paid by those on pre-payment meters, increased the local housing allowance and raised benefits by double the expected inflation ...\n12:39 PM GMT\nInflation to fall below 2pc in a few months\nMr Hunt said he would deliver \u201cmore investment, more jobs, better public services and better taxes in a long-term Budget for growth\u201d.\nHe pointed out that the OBR predicts inflation will fall below the 2pc target in just a few months time, \u201cnearly a whole year earlier than expected\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cThat didn\u2019t happen by accident.\u201d\n12:36 PM GMT\nHunt: Growth larger than every large European economy\nJeremy Hunt said Conservatives know that lower taxes mean higher growth.\nThe deputy speaker interrupted proceedings to say the Chancellor has \u201chardly said anything\u201d amid raucous calls in the Commons.\n12:38 PM GMT\nChancellor accuses Labour of imposing burdens on business\nJeremy Hunt said Labour would damage employment:\nTheir plans destroy jobs with 70 new burdens on employers ... reduce opportunities by halving new apprenticeships ... and risk family finances with spending that pushes up tax.\n12:37 PM GMT\nChancellor says immigration is not the answer to growth\nJeremy Hunt suggested the country should focus on building a high skill economy rather than growth through unlimited immigration:\nIf we want ... growth to lead to higher wages and higher living standards for every family in every corner of the country, it cannot come from unlimited migration. It can only come by building a high wage, high skill economy. Not just higher GDP but higher GDP per head.\n12:36 PM GMT\nPermanent cuts in taxes promised\nThe Chancellor said:\nOf course, interest rates remain high as we bring down inflation. But because of the progress we\u2019ve made ... because we are delivering the Prime Minister\u2019s economic priorities ... we can now help families not just with temporary cost of living support ... but with permanent cuts in taxation.\n12:35 PM GMT\nChancellor says lower taxes mean higher growth\nThere was some jeering from the Opposition benches to this statement.\n12:34 PM GMT\nChancellor gives \u00a31m to remember muslims who died in world wars\nJeremy Hunt began by talking about Muslim contributors to the fight for freedom in the world wars. He said:\nI start today by remembering the Muslims who died in two world wars in the service of freedom and democracy. We need a memorial to honour them, so following representations from the Rt Hon Member for Bromsgrove and others, I have decided to allocate \u00a31m towards the cost of building one. Whatever your faith or colour or class, this country will never forget the sacrifices made for our future. In recent times, the UK economy has dealt with a financial crisis, a pandemic and an energy shock caused by war in Europe.\n12:33 PM GMT\nJeremy Hunt begins Budget speech\nAnd we\u2019re off. Jeremy Hunt, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, has begun his Budget speech.\nHe began the speech by talking of the need to \u201cfight extremism,\u201d remembering Muslims who died in the two world wars.\nHe has announced funding for a memorial.\n12:26 PM GMT\nPM asked if he is proud of presiding over \u2018highest tax burden\u2019\nA stinging question from Dame Angela Eagle, who asked the Prime Minister which of his economic policies he is most proud of.\nShe said is it \u201cpresiding over the highest tax burden\u201d or the \u201cslowest wage growth since the Napoleonic war?\u201d\nMr Sunak quickly replied that it is \u201csaving 10m jobs in the pandemic with the furlough scheme\u201d.\n12:21 PM GMT\nPound ticks up ahead of Budget speech\nA quick glance at the markets before the Chancellor gets up to deliver his Budget speech shows the pound is up 0.2pc against the dollar to $1.27.\nBond yields have drifted higher, with the 10-year gilt yield at 4.04pc.\nBritain\u2019s flagship stock market, the FTSE 100, has risen 0.3pc today to 7,671.30.\n12:14 PM GMT\nChancellor is in his seat\nJeremy Hunt is in the chamber, sitting next to Allister Jack. the Scottish Secretary, and Laura Trott, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, ahead of his speech.\n12:11 PM GMT\nHow taxes have soared to a record high under 14 years of Tory rule\nAs Jeremy Hunt prepares to deliver what may be his final pre-election Budget, the message will be that Conservatives know that lower taxes means higher growth. However, he faces an inconvenient fact.\nOur senior economics reporter Eir Nols\u00f8e has this analysis:\nAlthough the average worker will enjoy a \u00a3450 annual boost to their earnings if he unveils an expected 2p cut to national insurance, the tax burden will still be on track to hit a post-war high.\nRead how as Jeremy Hunt prepares to deliver his Budget, he faces an inconvenient legacy.\n12:07 PM GMT\nPrime Minister\u2019s Questions begins\nNot long now until the Budget speech. First we have the small task of Prime Minister\u2019s Questions.\nThe session begins in earnest with Sir Keir Starmer, the leader of Labour, asking Rishi Sunak, the Prime Minister, about the murder of Sarah Everard and how such serious failures in police vetting by the Metropolitan Police were allowed to happen.\nMr Sunak said he is \u201csure all members of the House will have been thinking about Sarah Everard\u201d and \u201cthe abuse of power\u201d that lead to her murder.\nHe said the Government had instigated the \u201clargest ever screening of all serving officers and staff\u201d.\n11:49 AM GMT\nBudget must focus on long-term to trigger growth, say economists\nThe Chancellor has been urged to resist the temptation for pre-election giveaways and instead focus on long-term economic growth.\nPaula Bejarano Carbo, an economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said:\nToday\u2019s Spring Budget is taking place against a backdrop of low economic growth, as seen most notably by GDP per head being lower in the last quarter of 2023 than just before the pandemic (2019 Q4).\n11:44 AM GMT\nTax burden to hit record levels by end of decade, economists warn\nExperts said that a 2p reduction in National Insurance contributions would not be enough by itself to stop the tax burden reaching record levels by the end of this decade.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies said the measure would not prevent taxes rising to about 37pc of GDP by 2028-29.\nThe Resolution Foundation think tank said the biggest net beneficiaries of the National Insurance cut, combined with threshold freezes, are those earning \u00a350,000, while those earning \u00a319,000 or less will actually be worse off.\nMr Hunt has said he will not pay for tax cuts with borrowing, meaning a combination of spending cuts and tax rises elsewhere will be necessary.\nTax rises could include a levy on vapes, a tax raid on owners of short-term holiday lets, and the scaling back of non-dom tax relief - a policy previously advocated by Labour and opposed by ministers.\nMr Hunt could shave more off his post-election public spending plans to fund giveaways, reducing overall departmental spending - currently pencilled in to rise by 1pc per year in real terms after 2025 - to 0.7pc.\n11:33 AM GMT\nHunt: We must stick to the plan to bring down taxes\nJeremy Hunt insisted his plan to get the economy on the path to \u201chealthy growth\u201d and \u201cbringing down taxes\u201d was working as he prepared for the Budget.\nThe Chancellor briefed the Cabinet on the contents of the statement, which is expected to include a 2p cut to National Insurance to ease the tax burden on workers.\nIn a promotional video released by the Treasury, Mr Hunt pleaded with the UK to back him and not \u201cthrow away\u201d the work done to repair the economy.\nThe economy slipped into a technical recession at the end of 2023 and the Tories are around 20 points behind in the polls, meaning that Mr Hunt is under pressure to revive both growth and the Conservatives\u2019 election prospects.\nPleading with the public to back his plan, he said:\nWe\u2019ve worked so hard to get through the really challenging period that we\u2019ve come through. Don\u2019t throw it away.\n11:19 AM GMT\nListen: Ben Riley-Smith on Tory dreams for tax-cutting Budget\n11:15 AM GMT\n2p National Insurance cut: how much you would save\nThe average employee earning \u00a335,000 will save \u00a3785 a year thanks to National Insurance being cut by a further 2p in today\u2019s spring Budget.\n\u201cClass 1\u201d National Insurance was charged at a rate of 12pc in April 2023, but following successive cuts will now be 8pc for the next year. It has already fallen to 10pc from January.\nJeremy Hunt has decided to cut NI after deciding a cut to income tax would be too expensive.\nGovernment sources said the average worker would save \u00a3450 as a result of the latest cut to NI.\nUse our calculator here to see how much you\u2019ll save both from this cut, and the previous one that took effect in January this year.\n11:07 AM GMT\nTruss mini-Budget \u2018casts long shadow\u2019 over Hunt\u2019s choices, says economist\nThe fallout from the Liz Truss mini-Budget will mean Jeremy Hunt is likely to try to avoid any announcements that could shock debt markets, according to an economist.\nSimon French, the chief economist at Panmure Gordon, told Sky News \u201cthere is still a long shadow being cast by the mini Budget\u201d.\nBack then the Government announced \u00a345bn in unfunded tax cuts. Mr French said:\nWhen you are doing something that the debt market is not anticipating, you always run the risk that the investors on whom you rely in terms of funding what is a \u00a32.5 trillion debt burden, and a deficit of around \u00a3100bn a year, you always worry there will be some indigestion - or quite significant indigestion as was seen back in September [2022, at the mini-Budget].\n10:58 AM GMT\nHunt could \u2018gamble\u2019 on borrowing to trigger growth, says economist\nJeremy Hunt could be tempted to borrow more to fund growth in Britain\u2019s economy in a calculated \u201cgamble\u201d aimed at imitating policies in the United States, according to a leading economist.\nSimon French, the chief economist at Panmure Gordon, acknowledged that it is \u201cvery unlikely\u201d the Treasury would try to borrow to fund tax cuts, which is what led to the downfall of the Liz Truss government after the ill-fated mini-Budget.\nHowever, he said that the Government could be casting \u201cjealous looks\u201d at growth figures for the US economy, which is being powered by vast borrowing for green subsidies.\nBond traders have been nervy in morning trading as they wait to see if Mr Hunt will try to pull a rabbit out of the hat in his Budget speech, with yields on UK gilts edging higher.\nMr French told Sky News:\nOne of the problems global economies are currently grappling with is that a major economic neighbour - the biggest economy in the world, the United States - is pursuing a much looser fiscal stance with much more borrowing and is growing at a very rapid rate.\n10:33 AM GMT\nUK bond market wavers ahead of Chancellor\u2019s speech\nBond traders have been nervy in morning trading as they wait to see if Jeremy Hunt will try to pull a rabbit out of the hat in his Budget speech.\nThe Chancellor is widely expected to announce a 2p cut to National Insurance but onlookers are keen to see if he will try to announce another eye-catching pre-election policy.\nHowever, it comes as Mr Hunt has faced a squeeze on the amount of space he has within his fiscal rules to announce tax cuts.\nIt is barely 18 months since money markets were sent into turmoil after Liz Truss\u2019s government announced unfunded spending cuts in the ill-fated mini-Budget.\nToday, the yield on 10-year UK gilts - the return the Government promises to pay buyers of its debt - edged higher to 4.04pc, rising higher than most comparable European bonds.\n10:24 AM GMT\nWhat time is the Budget speech today?\nThe Chancellor will deliver his speech at about 12.30pm, shortly after the end of Prime Minister\u2019s Questions, which begins at noon.\nHere is what to expect.\n10:18 AM GMT\nChancellor has to stimulate growth without inflation \u2018spike up\u2019\nOne of the major challenges facing the Chancellor is delivering the tax cuts he believes will stimulate the economy without triggering a fresh rise in inflation.\nThe pace of annual price rises have dropped from 11.1pc in October 2022 to 4pc last month but sweeping tax cuts risk reigniting inflation if it gives households more capacity to buy up limited numbers of goods, sending prices higher.\nHowever, the Chancellor wants to get Britain\u2019s economy growing again after it fell into recession at the end of last year.\nDaniela Hathorn, a senior market analyst at Capital.com, said:\nThere is positivity that there\u2019s going to be fiscal steps to aid the suffering in the UK economy.\n10:02 AM GMT\nPictured: Hunt addresses ministers ahead of Budget\nRishi Sunak appears to be paying close attention as Chancellor Jeremy Hunt briefs ministers during a pre-Budget meeting of the Cabinet:\n09:58 AM GMT\nPictured: Ministers arrive for pre-Budget Cabinet meeting\nLord Cameron, James Cleverly and Grant Shapps have been pictured as ministers arrive in Downing Street for a pre-Budget briefing.\nThe Chancellor will appear later this morning for his photo opportunity with his red box, before heading to the Commons, where he will deliver his speech at about 12.30, after Prime Minister\u2019s Questions.\n09:51 AM GMT\nGovernment sells-off more NatWest shares\nThe Government has sold off more of its stake in NatWest as onlookers ponder whether the Treasury\u2019s stake in the bank may become a focal point in the Budget.\nThe taxpayer\u2019s stake in NatWest has dropped from 32.88pc to 31.85pc after the sale on Tuesday, which has just been disclosed.\nJeremy Hunt channeled Margaret Thatcher\u2019s \u201cTell Sid\u201d campaign to get British people buying shares during his Autumn Statement in November.\nThe Chancellor said the Treasury would \u201cexplore options\u201d for a potential NatWest share offer in the next 12 months, but said it would be \u201csubject to supportive market conditions\u201d and \u201cvalue for money\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s time to get Sid investing again.\u201d\n09:44 AM GMT\nUK-only Isa could help revive \u2018undervalued\u2019 British stocks\nSome of the chatter ahead of the Budget was around whether the Chancellor will use his Budget speech to encourage voters to invest in UK stock markets.\nA so-called \u201cGreat British Isa\u201d would allow savers investing exclusively in British stocks to invest an extra \u00a35,000 a year in Isas tax free, taking their annual limit to \u00a325,000.\nDan Squires, from investment platform Saxo, said products like Isas are popular with investors and a UK-only Isa would help revive British stocks that are \u201cundervalued\u201d.\n09:33 AM GMT\nFind out what the Budget means for you with Katie Morley and Camilla Tominey\nJeremy Hunt\u2019s spring Budget promises to be one of the most consequential in years.\nSo later, you can join The Telegraph\u2019s consumer champion Katie Morley and associate editor Camilla Tominey online as they discuss what it means for your money and the future of the Government.\nYou can pre-submit your questions to be answered in a live Q&A and find out if you\u2019ll be better or worse off as Katie explains how the Chancellor\u2019s tax tweaks and other announcements will affect your personal finances.\nCamilla will delve into whether the Budget can save the Conservative Party \u2013 or whether it will hand Labour an easy ride to power.\n09:14 AM GMT\nPound edges up as Hunt prepares to deliver Budget\nThe pound has edged higher as money markets appear relatively settled in the run-up to Jeremy Hunt\u2019s Budget speech.\nSterling inched up 0.1pc against the dollar to more than $1.27 but was flat against the euro, which is worth 85p.\nThe pound has risen for four consecutive days in the lead up to the Chancellor\u2019s speech.\nAnalysts think that run could continue if Mr Hunt reveals plans to stimulate the economy, even if the Bank of England cuts interest rates as expected later this year.\nChris Turner, the head of FX strategy at ING, said: \u201cSome decent fiscal stimulus should only delay the Bank of England easing cycle and support sterling.\u201d\n09:04 AM GMT\nSocial care \u2018crisis point\u2019 requires pre-election plan, say bosses\nSocial care bosses are not hopeful for any support in the Budget but have called for a \u201ccredible\u201d plan going into the election to save a sector at \u201ccrisis point\u201d.\nSam Monaghan, the chief executive of the UK\u2019s largest charity care provider MHA, said:\nThere\u2019s a gaping chasm between government funding for social care and the cost of providing care. In reality, we\u2019re not expecting this shortfall to be addressed when the Chancellor outlines his Spring Budget.\n08:51 AM GMT\nFTSE 100 higher ahead of Budget speech\nUK shares have edged higher as investors await the Budget.\nThe blue-chip FTSE 100 was up 0.3pc, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 added 0.6pc.\nInvestors will remain focused on Jeremy Hunt presenting his pre-election Budget, in which he is expected to provide tax cuts, despite the economy facing its biggest debt burden since the 1960s.\nHowever, the FTSE 100 was held back from further gains by Legal & General, which slid 4pc to lead losses on the index after it missed expectations for 2023 operating profit.\n08:46 AM GMT\nUK on \u2018path to lower taxes,\u2019 says senior Tory MP\nBritain is on a \u201cpath to lower taxes,\u201d a senior MP has said ahead of the Budget speech.\nHarriet Baldwin, the chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, said the Chancellor \u201ccontinues to want to see lower taxes\u201d but had been constrained by money spent on furlough during the pandemic and on support with energy bills after the beginning of the war in Ukraine.\nShe told GB News: \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing now is a path to lower taxes - to being able to hand some of that money back to taxpayers.\u201d\nShe added that official forecaster the OBR felt that cutting National Insurance would be less of a threat to inflation than cutting income tax.\n08:26 AM GMT\nBond yields tick up ahead of Budget\nIt has been about a year and a half since Liz Truss\u2019s mini-Budget triggered a crisis in bond markets after the announcement of unfunded tax cuts.\nPerhaps understandably then, yields are creeping up ahead of the Chancellor\u2019s speech.\nThe benchmark 10-year gilt yield - the return the Government promises to pay buyers of its debt - has ticked up three basis points to 4.04pc in early trading, ahead of other major European economies.\n08:12 AM GMT\nHunt: Great Budgets change history\nJeremy Hunt said \u201cgreat budgets changed history\u201d as he outlined how he would \u201cstick to the plan\u201d on the economy.\nThe Treasury has released a video of the Chancellor analysing his announcements in the November Autumn Statement.\nHe said: \u201cGreat budgets change history. The bit of history I want to change is to show people it is possible if we stick to a plan through all the ups and downs, through all the challenges, it\u2019s possible to have healthy growth, good public services and to bring down taxes.\u201d\n08:07 AM GMT\nUK markets subdued ahead of Budget\nIt was a quiet start for stock markets in London this morning as traders wait to see whether the Chancellor will pull any rabbits out of his hat during his Budget speech.\nThe FTSE 100 was little changed at 7,644.04, although the midcap FTSE 250 gained 0.2pc to 19,314.18.\n07:58 AM GMT\nWhat to expect in Jeremy Hunt\u2019s Budget: NI cuts confirmed\nA 2p cut in National Insurance contributions looks certain in today\u2019s Budget after government sources confirmed the move, writes Richard Evans.\nThe Chancellor is said to have decided on the NI reduction because a cut in income tax would be too expensive.\nThe reduction will be worth \u00a3450 for the average worker. When combined with the 2p cut in NI announced in November last year, which took effect in January, the latest move will save the average worker \u00a3900.\nA rise in duty on petrol and diesel appears to have been all but ruled out.\nRead everything you need to know about today\u2019s Budget announcement.\n07:53 AM GMT\nReeves: Budget should be \u2018final chapter\u2019 for Conservatives\nThe Labour shadow chancellor has said \u201cnothing Jeremy Hunt says or does today\u201d will change Britain being \u201cworse off\u201d under the Conservatives:\n07:44 AM GMT\nBritain needs \u2018long-term\u2019 plan for investment, says CBI\nBritain needs a \u201clong-term\u201d plan for business growth, a lobby group has urged, as the Chancellor prepares to set out tax cuts in his Budget.\nIn his Autumn Statement in November, Jeremy Hunt said he would find \u00a34.5bn over the five years to 2030 to attract investment into strategic manufacturing sectors.\nRain Newton-Smith, the CBI director general, called for a plan that is \u201ccredible, deliverable and helps to drive investment in the UK and helps to drive our international competitiveness as well\u201d.\nShe told BBC Radio 4:\nWe know that more broadly the public finances are under pressure.\n07:25 AM GMT\nWe all know there is no magic money tree, say bosses\nBusinesses understand that there is \u201cno magic money tree\u201d for the Chancellor as he prepares to deliver his Budget speech, according to a childcare boss.\nRos Marshall, the managing director of Bright Horizons, which employs 8,000 people, told BBC Radio 4:\nIt is nice to have at least some general recognition that the 2p cut in NI will go ahead because that will certainly give some savings for workers and put money back into people\u2019s pockets.\n07:24 AM GMT\nNational Insurance cut will prompt future tax rises, Hunt warned\nA 2p cut to National Insurance in today\u2019s Budget will eventually lead to more tax rises, economists have warned.\nAdam Corlett, the principal economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, said there were \u201chuge questions\u201d about the need for tax cuts this year, given the outlook for public spending and the need to reduce our national debt.\nJeremy Hunt is expected to announce that he has chosen to cut National Insurance, rather than a more expensive reduction in income tax, in a move that will save workers \u00a3900 a year when combined with the cut announced last autumn.\nThe cut is expected to be partly paid for by a series of tax increases, potentially on business class airfares, vapes and an extension to the windfall tax on oil and gas producers.\nMr Corlett said: \u201cWhile this is going to be a tax-cutting election year, it is sandwiched between significant past and future tax rises, with the budget likely to only add to the number of tax increases coming in after the election.\u201d\n07:18 AM GMT\nGood morning\nThanks for joining me for your live Budget updates. Jeremy Hunt\u2019s plan to cut 2p off National Insurance will eventually lead to a number of tax increases after the next election, economists have warned.\nAdam Corlett, the principal economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank, said the tax cut - announced in November and worth \u00a3900 to the average worker when combined with NI reductions - will \u201conly add to the number of tax increases coming in after the election\u201d.\n5 things to start your day\n1) Hunt\u2019s inheritance tax \u2018stealth\u2019 raid has cost families \u00a31.5bn | Pressure mounts on Chancellor to unfreeze \u2018nil-rate band\u2019 allowance as Budget looms\n2) Jeremy Hunt to cut 2p off National Insurance rather than \u2018inflationary\u2019 income tax | Government will bring forward legislation next week to enable the reduction, worth \u00a3450 for average worker, to come into effect in April\n3) 2p National Insurance cut: how much you would save | Work out how much Jeremy Hunt\u2019s reduction will benefit you\n4) Ambrose Evans-Pritchard: Britain is living beyond its means | But slashing public investment is the worst thing to do | The UK must not succumb to policy defeatism\n5) Jeremy Warner: The cause of Britain\u2019s housing woes has been staring the Tories in the face | Having failed to control immigration, the Conservatives have also failed to provide for it\nWhat happened overnight\nThe Chancellor will deliver his Budget at an exuberant time for markets. Gold prices and bitcoin hit all-time highs on Tuesday before paring some gains, while a sell-off in some tech stocks led to a slump in many stock markets around the world.\nOn Wall Street, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average both finished 1pc lower, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite index ended the day down 1.7pc, pulled down by firms including Apple and Tesla.\nStocks in Asia were mixed overnight with Tokyo\u2019s key Nikkei index ended marginally lower by 6.85 points to end at 40,090.78, while the broader Topix index added 0.4pc, or 10.74 points, to 2,730.67.\nWe will keep you updated here all day on the latest on the Budget and what it means for your finances and the economy.",

        "full_text": "Gold Fields Limited (NYSE:GFI) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript February 22, 2024\nGold Fields Limited isn\u2019t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\nMike Fraser: Good day, everybody and welcome to Gold Fields\u2019 2023 Financial Results Presentation. For those of you that I haven\u2019t yet met, my name is Mike Fraser and I have been CEO of Gold Fields since the January 1, 2024. I took over from Martin Preece, who was Interim CEO during the course of 2023 and I want to thank Martin again for his contribution over the past 12 months. We distributed our results book earlier today. And if you haven\u2019t seen it, it is on our website at goldfields.com. On the first slide of this presentation is a photo of the Brecha Principal pit at Salares Norte. And it indicates a significant amount of activity that has taken place over the past 2 years in mining the ore body. And that\u2019s enabled us to have 520,000 ounces of contained gold in our stockpiles ahead of processing at our processing plant in construction.\nIf we go to the next slide, please take note of our forward-looking statement, which you can peruse on our website. Just moving on to the next slide, which is our agenda. Our agenda for today, we are going to go through the 2023 overview. I\u2019ll talk about safety and sustainability in the business, an operation overview and update on Salares Norte. Paul will take us through the financials and then we will end with guidance for 2024. Just moving on to the next slide. I believe Gold Fields offers a very strong value proposition. We have a very clearly defined and well-executed strategy consisting of our three pillars that have been clearly communicated previously. We have a geographically diverse portfolio in attractive mining jurisdictions. The addition of Windfall last year was a significant improvement in the portfolio.\nAnd we have a track record of meeting cost and production guidance. In 2023, we again achieved cost guidance and were achieved 99.7% of our production guidance. We are in a fortunate position of having a quality pipeline of projects in Salares Norte, which is a world-class deposit in the Northern Atacama desert. The proposed Tarkwa-Iduapriem JV in Ghana, which will create one of the largest gold mines in Africa and the Windfall project in Canada, which is again a high-quality project in Quebec province, which is a very attractive mining jurisdiction and more of this later in the presentation. What is important is having a disciplined capital allocation methodology and an approach. Our first priority in our capital allocation is investing in safe and reliable production at our assets.\nWe also have very much focused on ensuring a strong balance sheet to maintain an investment-grade credit rating in the business. We have had strong financials clearly also supported by strong tailwinds in the gold price and we have sound debt levels that is at below 0.5% of net debt to EBITDA. Next to be funded in our capital allocation profile or shareholder returns in the form of a base dividend in line with our policy. And thereafter, we want all opportunities to compete and that is based on returns and positive returns to the business. Our focus here is for 2024, including materially improving our safety performance. I\u2019ll talk a little bit about this later, but 2023 was a very big disappointment. Ensuring that predictable delivery of our operating plan, taking steps to mitigate the recent negative cost trajectory into future years and deliver on our clear portfolio initiatives, which will also have a strong contribution to reducing our cost trajectory.\nAnd lastly, a clear focus on capital discipline going forward. Lastly on this slide, we pride ourselves in our ESG leadership. This is a key part of our strategy. And in 2024, we will continue to progress on all of our six priority areas, in particularly our decarbonization commitments, which I\u2019ll talk to shortly. Moving on to our 2023 performance, starting with safety. Tragically, we had 2 fatalities last year, both at our Tarkwa mine in Ghana. And tragically, on the January 2 this year, we had a further fatality at South Deep. Clearly, this is unacceptable. And what we have done in response is to commission an independent review of our overall safety system of work, culture and systems with the objective of developing a single safety system of work that\u2019s fit for purpose for gold fields that will provide a high level of assurance of our ability to work safely.\nI mentioned cost and production performance earlier. And whilst we achieved our guidance in 2023, what is critical is that we deliver on our guidance in 2024. We delivered an adjusted free cash flow of $367 million after an operating cash flow from operations of a touch over $1 billion. Whilst we increased debt marginally, mainly to fund the Salares Norte project, our debt levels at 0.42x net debt to EBITDA are stable and healthy. We continue to pace strong dividends and this year declared a final dividend of ZAR4.20 per share, bringing the total for the year to ZAR7.45, which is unchanged from the 2022 dividend and just over 40% of normalized earnings. That generates a dividend yield of a touch over 3%. I\u2019ll touch a little bit more on Salares Norte later, but we are progressing commissioning with first gold expected by no later than April 2024.\nEarlier this week, the Board approved the go ahead to build a $195 million micro-grid at St. Ives comprising both solar and wind. This will be our most significant renewables investment to-date. It will provide almost 75% of the mine\u2019s electricity requirements and have the impact of reducing the electricity bill by nearly half. Just moving on to our global overview. This is a snapshot of our business performance in 2023. We will go into the individual performance in detail a little later, but worth pointing out for now is the strong contribution of our Australian operations, which account for over 45% of our production ounces. All of our operations contributed to our adjusted free cash flow performance for the year, thanks in part prior to the higher gold price, but also due to the great performance of our teams in our operations.\nI think one of the positives to call out is, in particular, South Deep\u2019s contribution and they contributed over $200 million of free cash flow to the organization. If you talk to the teams, this was almost kind of comprehensible a few years back and considering where South Deep has come from, I think this is a great achievement. Just moving on. Turning to ESG, which as you know, is our second pillar of the Gold Fields strategy. And I think this is a great example of the ESG commitment from the organization. And this is the 50-megawatt Khanyisa solar plant at South Deep. This has got over 100,000 solar panels and produces around 22% of the site\u2019s electricity needs. In late 2021, the business set itself ambitious 2030 targets for its six key ESG priorities, three related to people and stakeholders and three environmental.\nOn the safety side, tragically, we still have fatal and serious injuries in the business and I\u2019ll talk about that in a short while. However, we did have no serious environmental incidents and we haven\u2019t had for a number of years and it\u2019s a track record that we should be proud of. We are making steady progress in increasing women representation in the business. We have achieved over 25% women representation against our target of 30% by 2030. And another program that we are proud of is the focus on value creation for our communities. In the past year, we generated around $3.8 billion of contribution to our broader stakeholder group and almost over $1 billion in our direct communities in the form of procurement, employment and investment.\nOn the environmental front, I will talk about our decarbonization program shortly. But that, again, is a key part of an ambition to deliver 30% net reduction by 2030. On tailings, this is a critical issue for us and the industry and we are making very good progress in making our tailing facilities safer. We have a very strong technical team in-house that is actively involved in industry standard setting and industry benchmarking. During the year, we undertook a full self assessment of our priority tailings at Tarkwa and Cerro Corona in line with the global industry standard on tailings management and two of our upstream dams at Tarkwa transitioning to downstream facilities. On water stewardship, we are well on track to meeting the two targets we have set for 2030, namely recycling 80% of our water use and limiting fresh water usage at our operations.\nMoving on to safety. As I\u2019ve said, we have a lot of work to do in our industry overall and that is no different to Gold Fields to improve the company\u2019s health and safety performance. After reporting 2 fatalities last year and 1 to-date, we know that we need to do more. We have a range of safety processes in place across our business covering both leadership specific safety risk routines. We engage extensively with our people to support the design of work \u2013 safe design of work. We encourage our people to speak up when they feel they are not operating in line with standards. And if we cannot mine safely, we\u2019ll not mine. Despite this work, we realized this is not enough and we need to do more. So what we are doing, as I\u2019ve said earlier, is engaging an independent review.\nWe are bringing together our teams to understand what we need to do differently and ensure that we understand the design of work to ensure that we can deliver safe, predictable work in our organization. If we go to the occupational disease frequency rate, there was a slight rise in the year and this was largely due to noise-induced hearing loss cases at South Deep and in Australia. You are also all aware of the findings of the respectful workplace report carried out by Elizabeth Broderick & Company during August last year. We are very much committed to delivering on the 22 recommendations arising from that report and we will provide further detail in our annual report in March. Moving to decarbonization, our commitment and action to decarbonize the business has been one of the company\u2019s success stories.\nAnd to-date, we have had 5 of the 9 operations having a renewable source of energy. With South Deep and Gruyere coming on full stream for the period, it ensured that we had 17% of our total electricity mix from renewables and this contributed to a decline of 5% against our Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon emissions, which we believe is a good progress in the 12 months. Last year, we also released and announced a target for our Scope 3 emissions reduction of 10% by 2030. This may not feel like a huge amount, but Scope 3 emissions make up 40% of our total emissions. And this will require a lot of engagement with our suppliers and contractors to achieve this reduction. We are very much committed to this decarbonization journey. And as I mentioned earlier, the Board has approved one of our most ambitious projects to-date, which is the St. Ives micro-grid combining solar and wind with current gas supplies from the grid.\nThis is $195 million commitment. This year, we spend a significant chunk of that and that you will see coming through in our capital plan for 2024. This will allow St. Ives to have 73% of its energy electricity needs provided through renewables and results in an expected 50% of the energy costs. South Deep is also undertaking wind farm studies to further reduce their electricity requirements and dependence on Eskom. Lastly, I just want to outline the journey to 2030. As you know, our target is a 30% net decline on Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Since the gold production outlook is a little less certain, we are focusing on emissions intensity, which are the numbers circled on the graph. Here, you can see we are making good progress and shows that we are on track to deliver our 2030 plan with the planned and approved projects.\nThe South Deep wind turbine project is captured in the scoping and trials and what we have also not captured in here is the impact on the Windfall project, which will be 100% renewables via hydropower. And that agreement was signed with the First Nations in January of this year. Beyond renewables, there is still a lot of work to be done across the industry. We are committed to continuing studies for diesel replacement. And this will be extended beyond just battery electric vehicles, but including conveyors and other forms of ore transportation. We did indicate with the announcement of our Scope 3 targets last year that we would come back to the market in 2025 with a full review of our commitments for the remainder of the decade and that will be certainly an activity we will communicate back to the market.\nJust turning to group and regional results for 2023. This is just a photo of the Tarkwa open pit, which is the largest mine in our portfolio, moving the most tons of dirt. Going to our group results, whilst production was marginally down, down 4% year-on-year, it was delivered 99.7% of our guidance for 2023. Production for 2024 is guided to be 4% higher against 2023 numbers. And this is after taking into account the fact that we had 60,000 ounces from Asanko in 2023 and zero in 2024. This year, we will see growth coming into the portfolio from Salares as it starts its ramp-up and South Deep as it ramps up from 322,000 ounces in 2023. The all-in cost increase of 14% highlights some of the challenged operating environments and managing a key \u2013 the costs are going to be a key focus for us in 2024.\nAdditionally, you will see in the capital line, there is a significant increase in capital over the 2-year frame as we reinvest in the business. And again, coming back to capital discipline, this will be a key area for focus to ensure that we are delivering strong returns from the money we redeploy back into the business. The operating \u2013 operations delivered \u2013 generated adjusted free cash of just over $1 billion, which after deducting net capital expenditure, including Salares and Windfall environmental payments, lease payments and other expenses led to group free cash flow of $367 million. Moving to Australia, that the costs here are given in Australian dollars to show a year-on-year like-for-like comparison. This remains a cornerstone of our production base generating around $1 billion \u2013 1 million ounces of production, which is around 45% of our portfolio.\nAnd this region is guiding for another 1 million ounces of production in 2024. In 2023, costs, both in all-in cost and all-in sustained were higher in Australian dollar terms. Mining inflation is \u2013 remains very heightened in Western Australia and in particular, labor costs, which are impacting the business. There was a 5% weakening of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar, which provided some relief in U.S. dollar terms. We are developing the invincible ore body and St. Ives into a long-life Tier 1 ore body. As part of this transition, we are investing in a sizable renewable energy solution, as I spoke about earlier, and considering the most efficient ore handling solutions to reduce cost and reduce our energy requirements. Gruyere had a tough 2023 as the resource capacity of the mine to handle its increase in planned volumes was insufficient.\nWe have had a very strong collaborative intervention with the main contractor, the contractor principle as well as our partner in Gold Road. And we\u2019ve also introduced a bigger fleet to enhance the skill set on site. There\u2019s an active intervention ensuring that we ramp back up to our targeted production profile. Costs for 2024 across the region are guided to be 24% higher, of which 11% relates to the St. Ives microgrid, 3% to the underground open pit development at St. Ives and 2% to the additional stripping at Gruyere. Taking these projects costs out, costs are overall guided to be 9% higher, which continues to reflect the tight labor market conditions in Western Australia. As I said earlier, the production for 2024 is set to remain above 1 million ounces.\nMoving to South Africa and our South Deep operation. These costs are noted in rands per kilogram. South Deep had certainly some challenges in Q1 of 2023 with some ground conditions impacting production in the first quarter. The remainder of the year was really a catch-up for South Deep. The second impact was competition for key skills, which provided a headwind for the mine during the year. And in particular, the loss of drill rig operators and artisans to new underground mining projects that we\u2019re willing to pay a lot more for these skills. However, the team managed to rehabilitate the ground condition successfully and get back on track during the second half of last year. Pleasingly, availability and staffing of development rules is back to where it should be.\nThat had an impact of management production decreasing by 2% to 322,000 ounces in-line with the revised guidance. All-in costs and all-in sustaining costs were lower in U.S. dollar terms but rose in rand terms during \u2013 due to mining inflation and slightly higher volumes on a unit basis. Again, the difference explained by weaker rand against the dollar being 13% during the year. During 2023, South Deep successfully managed to extend the wage agreement by a further 2 years until 2026, which provides a good stable operating horizon for the business. Additionally, the initial development towards the south of Range mine began in 2023. Studies of the wind power to add to the 50-megawatt Khanyisa solar power plant also progressed during \u201823 and will be expect to be concluded this year.\nIn 2024, we are focusing on a safe, reliable production delivery year as we look to ramp up towards the 380,000 targeted mine capacity level, and we expect this to be reached towards the end of 2026. It\u2019s really important for us to understand that what is most important for South Deep is to continue to build on the successes that we\u2019ve delivered in the last few years and to continue to ramp up incrementally so that we don\u2019t move backwards. And as you can appreciate and look at the cash flow generation of the mine, this has been done really successfully and we need to just continue to build on that momentum. We are seeing some scheduled increases in costs in 2024 as a result of higher sustaining capital less levels due to an ongoing investment in renewables and the development towards South of Wrench.\nIn Ghana, attributable production was 8% lower at 633,000 ounces, and this was largely due to the planned decrease in production at demand. Mining has now ceased at demand, and we continue to mine stockpiles for the next 2 years. Tarkwa\u2019s production was 4% higher at 551,000 ounces and the mine remains a cornerstone asset for Gold Fields. What is also important is to understand the trajectory of costs and production in the region for \u201824 and \u201825. As Damang will only be processing stockpiles going forward it\u2019s all-in sustaining costs are expected to increase materially as we expense a portion of costs that were previously capitalized as the stockpiles were being built. This will distort the regional costs over the next 2 years, However, the mine and region will still generate a significant amount of cash at spot gold prices, given that there\u2019s a lot of accounting costs captured in those unit costs at Damang.\nIn the region, we also announced the sale of our 45% stake in Asanko at the end of last year. And that was announced by our partners as having fully completed during this week. And we\u2019re also looking at Damang and trying to understand what the ideal future status for Damang. It\u2019s really important that we act on this responsibly. It is a mine that is just over 20 kilometers away from our Tarkwa mine. And so managing the community effectively and responsibly as we as we manage that asset is really important for us in line with our values and our strategy. Lastly, the engagements with the government on the Tarkwa/Iduapriem JV are continuing. And whilst the tone of these discussions have become more collaborative and we engage very regularly.\nWe are fully cognizant that this is an election year in Ghana, and that undoubtedly will have some potential impact on the timing of these engagements. On Peru, gold equivalent production at Cerro Corona was 8% lower at 239,000 ounces with costs up 15% as a result of that lower production. This was impacted by two things: unseasonably heavy rain in H2 2023 significantly impacted production at the mine. But it is also a mine that\u2019s coming towards the back end of its life, and we will see some variability in mine production. Studies are underway to optimize the asset as the mine\u2019s current production profile is scheduled to decline after 2025 when it will start processing stockpiles. We are also still awaiting the EIA approval for input tailings, which will enable that process to continue.\nI will now want to move to Salares Norte, and this is a an issue which is undoubtedly top of mind for many of our stakeholders and investors. And whilst the focus very much in getting this mine into production, we continue to invest in exploration. This is a photo of our geologists that work in nearby tenements looking for further opportunities to extend the life of Cerro Corona of Salares Norte into enter the future. The Salares Norte project is now 99.4% complete on a construction basis. The key circuits, Circuit A and Circuit B, have progressed significantly. And as I\u2019ve shown earlier, mining has continued throughout the project, and we have around 520,000 ounces of gold equivalent on the stockpile ready for processing. And the photo that I showed on the cover showed how far we have mined in the Brecha Principal Pit.\nIn December, we unfortunately announced a further delay in the first gold and subsequent ramp-up. We fully acknowledge that, that was a bit of a surprise to the market and unfortunate. But I think it was done with the right intention of ensuring that we deliver a safe and reliable ramp-up of this business which continues to remain a world-class deposit and one that will generate significant value for our shareholders in time to come. Since then, we\u2019ve been progressing and the construction, and we\u2019ve seen a significant step-up in labor availability from our contractors. And as of last week, we actually had our site completely full with contractors and our own employees. We are progressing well on addressing the outstanding pre-commissioning and commissioning activities.\nWe made very good progress on circuit A. And on the February 15, we produced the first filtered dry stack tailings in the business. And that will be \u2013 and there will be a vote later, which will show what that looks like. We are also still targeting first gold for by April 2024. We\u2019ve made very good progress on our production, and we feel confident that the completion of commissioning is on track. We did commission an independent review into the project schedule for first gold. This was completed by Hatch, undertaken independently and they\u2019ve verified and confirmed our schedule. We also have Hatch working on the second phase of the review, which is the full ramp up. Initially, we worked on a 12-month ramp-up to full production and that we expect in the next 2 weeks.\nThere\u2019s nothing at this stage that leads us to believe that, that would not be achievable. On capital, our guidance for the next 3 years is firstly, 250,000 ounces for 2024, 580,000 ounces for 2025 and 600,000 ounces from 2026. What is important to note is that for 2025, we will see a slight back dating or balance of production coming in the second half of the year as we are due and scheduled to take a small shut in the Q1 of 2024 to do the final calibration of the plant. Our cost guidance for this year because of the lower production is in the region of $1,790 to $1,850 per ounce and that\u2019s because of the production profile as well as the increased capital for the project. However, thereafter, the cost will return to the previously advised level of less than $800 per ounce for 2025 to 2029, and that will provide a significant dilution to the overall cost for the group.\nThe final project capital is expected to be in the range of $1.18 billion to $1.2 billion which is an increase on the previous guidance given the higher contract costs and the additional spend due to the additional time on site. Just moving on to the next. We will show a few photos from Salares Norte. And maybe just as I start this, the one thing that Gold Fields has been acknowledged for many, many years, and I think this is a demonstration is that South Deep mines at 3,200 meters below the surface and in sometimes very challenging conditions and Salares Norte is mining at 4,600 meters above sea level. And I think it\u2019s a testament to the technical capability in our organization that can deliver on these projects. What we can show in the project is on the right, this is the dry stack tailings, which have been produced.\nYou\u2019ll see on the bottom left, this is the tailings storage facility which it will be all dry filtered tailings. And then on the top right, just showing some of the plant from an aerial view. With that, I\u2019ll hand over to Paul to take us through the financials.\nPaul Schmidt: Thanks, Mike. Good day, everybody. Mike has alluded to a lot of the numbers, but just some of them that I want to talk to normalized earnings. $900 million, up 5% year-on-year. Adjusted free cash flow, $367 million. I\u2019ll talk to it on the next slide, we have done a reconciliation, all-in costs, $1,512 per ounce within our original guidance of $1,480 and $1,520 per ounce. The final dividend, I just want to talk to our final dividend of $4.20 and our total dividend of $7.45 for the year. If we compare it to last year, as Mike said, it\u2019s similar. However, last year included $0.185 that related to Yamana break fee. So if we compare apples for apples, we have increased by 33% from ZAR560 to ZAR745. Net debt has increased quite a bit from last year to 1024.\nThe main reason being we have invested $316 million into Windfall being part of the acquisition price, capital that we\u2019ve expanded. If we exclude that, net debt would have been similar at around $710 million year-on-year. What we\u2019re really, really proud of in terms of our loans and ESG, we did two green loans this year, a $1.2 billion loan and a AUD500 million loan and the three measurables we had was gender, water and decarbonization. Can we move to the next slide, please? This provides a breakdown of the cash flow. And Mike spoke to it, but I want to emphasize the $204 million made by South Deep. 5 years ago, when the market was putting pressure on, why don\u2019t you sell South Deep? We had said, we believe in South Deep. And if it gets up to where we want it to be, it can provide an annuity of circa $200 million free cash flow a year.\nWell, now we\u2019re starting to see it $204 million, so just over $1 billion free cash flow from the mines. We obviously then invested into Salares. We invested \u2013 this is the capital contribution, the normal capital for Windfall. We then obviously had our interest bills and then non-mine costs and working capital, giving the $367 million free cash flow that we had for the year. If we move to the next slide, the only point I want to highlight here is that in May, our 2024 bond matures of $500 million, and we will be paying it out of bank facilities that we have. I\u2019ll now hand back to Mike. Thank you very much.\nMike Fraser: Thank you, Paul. I just wanted to close on a brief outlook on the strategy and a bit of a focus for us in 2024. 2024 is going to be a significant \u2013 another significant CapEx year for Gold Fields. Total CapEx for the year is expected to be between $1.13 billion and $1.19 billion. And this includes sustaining capital of $860 million to $890 million. What is important to note is in that number is that we actually have around $132 million for St. Ives micro-grid, which is one could argue is a one-off number. In addition, we have $116 million for Salares Norte plus another $32 million for working capital build at Salares Norte. So that $280 million is quite an unusual spend in the year, and that would certainly take us back to a more normalized level of capital going forward.\nFor 2024, group attributable gold equivalent production is expected to be between 2.3 million ounces and 2.43 million ounces. As we said earlier, this is slightly higher than the 2023 actual and reflects the contribution from Salares and from South Deep and offset a little bit about against Demand and Cerro Corona who are planned reductions. All-in sustaining cost has guided to be between $1,400 and $1,440 per ounce, with all-in costs expected to be between $1,590 and $1,630 per ounce. Again, if you take out the St. Ives micro grid this has quite a big impact on bringing that back to more normalized levels. Our priorities for 2024, really, first and foremost, is ensuring the physical and wellness of our people, employees and contractors, continuing to drive the \u2013 particularly the priority findings from the respectful workplace report and undertaking the full review of our safety system will work across Gold Fields.\nSecondly, predictable delivery of our plan. We\u2019re fully conscious that we need to be able to deliver what we commit to deliver on. And we will focus very hard to delivering on the plan that we\u2019re presenting and the guidance that we presented. Importantly, that we start addressing the rise \u2013 the trend of increasing costs. And related to that is ensuring that we remain disciplined on the deployment of capital and ensuring the capital we do deploy, is returning \u2013 is providing good returns for the organization. Thirdly is to continue to make the progress against our 2030 ESG targets and particularly relating to our decarbonization journey, which we believe will be a differentiator in terms of our strategy. Additionally, to continue to improve the quality of our portfolio and the projects in the portfolio, particularly Salares Norte, which is a significant improvement for our portfolio.\nDelivering on the Tarkwa/Iduapriem JV and continue to progress the Windfall project. And with that, I\u2019d like to thank you for listening and hand over to Q&A.\nA - Unidentified Company Representative: Thanks Mike. I have two questions on the webcast. We also will be handing over to the conference call to take questions, if you don\u2019t mind. The first question is from Yaameen Gosain from Laurium Capital. And he says good day, please kindly explain why Salares Norte production falls off so sharply from 580 in 2025 to an average of 485 between 2025 and 2029 in terms of averages.\nMike Fraser: Hi, Yaameen, and thank you very much for that question. What we always knew is that Salares Norte is a very high-quality asset with certain high-grade areas. And what we are doing in optimizing the mine is accessing the higher-grade parts of the ore body first and processing that first because that was the optimized way of extracting value for this project. And it was always anticipated that we would see a production decline over the years. And that\u2019s why when we\u2019ve come out in the guidance today, we\u2019ve also spoken about what that profile looks like until 2029 and then for the remainder of the project. This was always anticipated in terms of our understanding of the current ore body. But as I mentioned and alluded to earlier, we continue to do nearby exploration to find opportunities to extend the life of that asset and find additional sources of ore to fill that mill beyond what our known resource looks like.\nBut this remains a world-class asset and will continue to be so for a number of years going forward.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Okay. Good. And the second question is also around Salares, Mike. It says given the Salares delays, please, can you clarify when the chinchilla relocation becomes an issue? In other words, when do you expect to start mining the impacted area?\nMike Fraser: Thank you for the question, Catherine. And look, I think the \u2013 first and foremost, the chinchilla relocation is a really important demonstration of our values. To-date, we have identified through 36 chinchillas through the extensive monitoring that\u2019s been undertaken in the potentially impacted rockeries. We actually start commencing the relocation of the chinchillas at the end of February. We will continue this until around May, which we will then pause during the winter months and continue that once the summer starts. This is around an 18-month program and we are investing a significant amount in bringing in a number of independent experts to support us to ensure that we do this safely and with the right degree of care.\nTo answer your question in particular, we only really start getting to Agua Amarga in around quarter two of 2029. So, it\u2019s actually quite a long way away. But we want to get ahead of it and actually do this to ensure that there is no impact at all through the mining of Brecha Principal and also because there is one of the rockeries is quite close to one of the waste dumps. We want to make sure that we actually do this now rather than wait. So, there is no risk really in terms of future mining.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Thanks Mike. The next one is from Andrea Phillis from Risk Insight, and it\u2019s not a question. She says, risk insights has been generating ESG ratings for Gold Fields since 2016, it\u2019s encouraging to note the consistent positive ratings and the observed improvements across all the areas. This demonstrates the company\u2019s commitment to enhancing its environmental, social and governance practices over time, which is commendable and aligns well with sustainable business practices. So, at least that\u2019s a bit of positivity. And then on the next one is from Emmanuel Mungari from Bloomberg Intelligence. It\u2019s mostly for Paul. He says going through a period of sticky cost pressures and higher CapEx, should the gold price weakness starts to eat more into your cash margins? Are there any other levers you can pull that could keep costs specifically AISC within range or lower? And what do you consider as a targetable debt level or range?\nPaul Schmidt: I will answer the debt first. We have always said anything below 1x net debt to EBITDA, we would be comfortable with. Obviously, we are below 0.5x, which makes us incredibly comfortable. In terms of the pressures on the costs, a lot obviously depends on the oil price. We got some positive tailwinds last year, but we have seen oil starting to tick up this year. Obviously, during this year, Mike has alluded, we will look at our capital spend and make sure that we spend the capital in the right places and at the right amount. And that should theoretically help us on our all-in sustaining cost.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Good. And a follow-up question for Mike from Emmanuel. Are there any pain points in the business that you have identified that you would like to tackle immediately in the business, if any?\nMike Fraser: So, thank you, Emmanuel. And I wouldn\u2019t say they are pain points, but I think they are really opportunities for us to improve. I think we have spoken about safety. I think really bringing that first and foremost into our mindset and responding to that is really, really key. Delivering on Salares Norte, I think will be really value added. And I know it\u2019s been disappointing that there has been delays, but I don\u2019t want to stop reiterating, this is a world-class project and one that many people would love to have in their portfolios, and it\u2019s going to be a very strong cash generator for us. And then obviously, we have spoken about the leadership changes. And I think that could create nervousness. But I would say that everybody who is here is leaving, including Paul, he has been well foreshadowed that he is leaving at some point.\nHe has been super helpful for me in terms of my onboarding and very professional as we move forward. So, that\u2019s certainly not a pain point. But the one thing I would like to do is to see our organization working a lot closer together. And the way that our business had been set up in the past is very much on a regionalized basis. And I would like to leverage off the great capabilities that sit in different parts of our business. So, I see it more as an opportunity than a pain point.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Thanks Mike. The next one is from Sandile from Umthombo Wealth. He says, what\u2019s next after Salares and the Yamana setback?\nMike Fraser: Thank you very much for that question. And I think the way I would like to answer that question is, this sector, the gold sector is likely to undertake further consolidation one way or another. There is a wide range of different valuations on assets in the market, and there is not full price discovery on certain assets. I think we feel confident that we have a good process and system in place to identify options to grow and to replace reserves. And I will talk about those separately because I think the way that we think about growth is not just in the form of ounces or production ounces, but actually in growing the value of the company by growing cash flow per share. And that means that we have to continue to focus on bringing quality ounces into our portfolio.\nWe will always be looking at bolt-on acquisitions. Windfall was a great opportunity. We can never close our minds to transformational M&A, but I would say that that\u2019s a very \u2013 we certainly aren\u2019t looking at that right now. And our focus this year is very much on delivering the things that are or within our basket right now.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Thanks Mike. And then the last question is from Chantelle Baptiste from Fairtree [ph]. Perhaps to Paul, how much CapEx do you need to spend on Windfall over the next 3 years?\nPaul Schmidt: We have got about $45 million, correct me if I am wrong, for the 2024 year. Obviously, when we go into 2025 and assume that we have got the EIA and we make our second payment of CAD300 million, we still have to approve the capital project, which that \u2013 so I can\u2019t give you a number because we are waiting for that, and we are working at the moment to come up with a revised number as it was previously disclosed by our partners with Windfall. So, I can only give you for \u201824.\nUnidentified Company Representative: Thanks Paul. That\u2019s it from the webcast questions. We are going to go over to the conference call. And I think there is three questions that are pending.\nSee also 16 States With the Lowest Or No Sales Tax and Jim Cramer\u2019s 2024 Portfolio: 10 Latest Stock Picks.\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.",

We will be referring to a presentation during the conference call that is available through the webcast and on our website. I would also like to remind everyone that our presentation will be followed by a Q&A session.\nAs we will be making forward-looking statements during the call, please refer to the cautionary notes included in the presentation, news release, and MD&A as well as the risk factors set out in our Annual Information Form. Technical information in this presentation has been reviewed and approved by Chris Bostwick, our Senior VP Technical Services and a qualified person. Also please bear in mind that all dollar amounts mentioned in this conference call are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Now, John will provide you with an overview.\nJohn McCluskey: Thank you, Scott. I would also like to welcome everybody to the call and I'd like to turn your attention to Slide 3. 2023 marked our 20th anniversary and it was a record year on multiple fronts with the solid fourth quarter performance. We produced a record 529,000 ounces of gold for the full year achieving the top end of our increased production guidance of 15% increase from 2022, costs which are already well below the industry average decreased 4% to $1160 per ounce beating guidance once again with the record production lower costs and stronger gold price. We set a number of financial records in 2023. Revenue increased 25% for the year to a record $1 billion operating cash flow. Working capital increased 44% to a record $520 million.\nWe also generated $124 million of free cash flow, a significant increase from 2022, while continuing to invest in high-return growth. Now, looking at Slide 4. Earlier in the year, we announced our updated three-year guidance which included a 3% increase in our 2024 production guidance to approximately 505000 ounces with costs expected to remain flat year-over-year. By 2026, we expect our production to increase 7% to approximately 540,000 ounces and all-in sustaining costs decreased 11% to approximately $1,000 per ounce with the completion of the Phase 3 plus expansion at Island Gold. Our PDA underground deposit represents further upside that we plan on outlining in a development plan later this quarter. Beyond 2026, the Lynn Lake project represents further upside with initial production as early as the second half of 2027 and the capacity to increase our production to an annual rate of 800,000 ounces per year.\nAt current gold prices, we expect to continue generating strong free cash flow combined with $225 million of cash and no debt. We are well-positioned to fund this growth internally. Now looking at Slide 5, in addition to record operational and financial performance, we delivered on a number of our growth initiatives in 2023 after receiving the key environmental permit for the Lynn Lake project. In March, we completed an updated feasibility study outlining a larger longer-life low-cost operation. The project has attractive economics that we expect will continue to improve as we capitalize on its continued considerable exploration upside. We have doubled our budget. It would like to $25 billion for this year. With the focus on upgrading site infrastructure and derisking the project ahead of the expected construction decision in 2025.\nIsland Gold, we made a significant we made significant progress on the Phase 3 expansion with completion of key shaft infrastructure including the head frame and hoist house. This allowed start of shaft sinking in December. This is a significant milestone for the project putting it on track to completion in the first half of 2026. We also released our year-end 2023 reserve and resource update earlier this week, which outlined growth in all categories. Reserves increased for the fifth consecutive year to 10.7 million ounces and slightly higher grades reflecting another year of high-grade additions at Island Gold and PDA. Over the past five years, reserves have grown 10% net of depletion with grades also increasing 9% as we continued to improve the quality of our overall reserve base.\nWe continue to create value through exploration and investing in high-return growth projects. We expect that trend to continue in 2024, with a number of upcoming catalysts starting with our PDA development plan, later this quarter. Ongoing exploration updates, with our largest budget ever, continued progress with the expansion at Island Gold and a study incorporating the Burnt Timber and Linkwood satellite deposits into the Lynn Lake project, towards the end of the year. I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Greg Fisher to review our financial performance.\nGreg Fisher: Thank you, John. Moving to Slide 6 we sold 129,000 ounces of gold in the fourth quarter, at an average realized price of $1,974 per ounce, $3 per ounce above the London PM fix for revenues of $255 million. For the full year, we sold 526,000 ounces at a realized price of $1,944 per ounce, for record revenues of just over $1 billion, up 25% from 2022 Fourth quarter total cash cost of $900 per ounce and all-in sustaining costs of $1,233 per ounce were consistent with quarterly guidance. For the year total cash costs were $850 per ounce and all-in sustaining costs were $1,106 per ounce both in line with annual guidance and down 4% from 2022. Operating cash flow before changes in noncash working capital was $120 million in the fourth quarter or $0.30 per share.\nFor the full year, operating cash flow increased 44% to a record $519 million or $1.31 per share. Our reported net earnings were $47 million in the fourth quarter or $0.12 per share. This included unrealized foreign exchange gains of $13 million recorded within deferred taxes and foreign exchange offset by other losses of $15 million. Excluding these items, our adjusted net earnings were $49 million or $0.12 per share. Our full year adjusted net earnings were $208 million or $0.53 per share. Capital spending in the quarter totaled $110 million and includes $27 million of sustaining capital, $73 million of growth capital and $10 million capitalized exploration. For the full year, capital expenditures totaled $349 million including growth capital of $217 million, this was in line with guidance and up from 2022, with the ramp-up of construction activities on the Phase 3 expansion at Island Gold.\nFree cash flow in the quarter was $14 million and totaled $124 million for the full year, a significant increase from 2022 while continuing to reinvest in the Phase 3+ Expansion. This reflected the strong operational performance of the Young-Davidson generating more than $100 million of free cash flow for the third consecutive year and the Mulatos district generating an impressive $142 million. Given the increased profitability of Mulatos through 2023, we expect to pay significantly higher cash taxes in Mexico in 2024. This includes the 2023 yearend tax payment of approximately $40 million, during the first quarter of 2024. With the strong free cash flow generation, our cash balance grew nearly $100 million to end the year at $225 million while remaining debt-free.\nWe expect to continue generating strong free cash flow at current gold prices and remain well positioned to fund our growth initiatives. I'll now turn the call over to our COO, Luc Guimond to provide an overview of our operations.\nLuc Guimond: Thank you, Greg. Moving to Slide 7. Young-Davidson ended the year on a strong note, with production of just under 50,000 ounces taking full year production to just over 185,000 ounces in line with guidance. Cash costs and all-in sustaining costs were also in line with guidance both for the quarter and the year. Young-Davidson continues to demonstrate strong operational and financial consistency, with mine site free cash flow of $35 million in the fourth quarter and a record $118 million for 2023. This marks the third consecutive year the operation has generated more than $100 million of mine site free cash flow. We are expecting production and all-in sustaining costs to be in a similar range in 2024, supporting another year of strong free cash flow.\nWith Young-Davidson 15-year reserve life maintained in the year end update. Earlier this week, we expect similar levels of free cash flow over the long run. Over to Slide 8. Island Gold produced 31,600 ounces in the fourth quarter, a decrease over the previous quarter due to lower grades mined and processed, as planned. Costs in the quarter were above annual guidance, reflecting the lower planned grades, as well as one-time costs associated with the transition from contractor to owner development and production drilling, which was completed in the quarter. Full year production of 131,000 ounces was in line with the midpoint of guidance, and costs came in slightly above guidance. The operation used $34 million of cash in the quarter and $60 million for the year, reflecting the ramp up of capital spending on the Phase 3+ Expansion as well as the significant ongoing exploration program.\nAt current gold prices, Island Gold is expected to continue to fund the majority of the Phase 3+ Expansion growth. Capital production is expected to increase 16% in 2024 to approximately 153,000 ounces at 12% lower all-in sustaining costs driven by higher grades. We expect further production growth in 2025 with another increase in grades, followed by another significant increase in production and decrease in costs into 2026 with the completion of the Phase 3+ Expansion. Over to Slide 9. The Phase 3+ Expansion continues to advance well with the majority of the shaft site infrastructure completed last year, including the hoist house and headframe, the project achieved a significant milestone in system in December with the start of shaft sinking, which is ramping up towards an ultimate rate of over three meters per day.\nThe focus in 2024 will be on shaft sinking down to a depth of 1,000 meters by year end. We also expect to start construction activities on the mill expansion in the second quarter followed by the paste plant in the second half of the year. Over to Slide 10. We remain on track to complete the expansion during the first half of 2026. At year end, approximately 51% of the total initial capital of $756 million had been spent and committed on the project. Our capital spending is tracking well for the work completed to-date. However, we are seeing some pressures from ongoing labor inflation in Canada growth. Capital spending on the Phase 3+ project Expansion is expected to range between $210 million and $230 million in 2024. A similar rate of spending is expected in 2025 for decreasing considerably in 2026 following the completion of the expansion.\nOver to slide 11. The Mulatos district produced 48,100 ounces in the fourth quarter and 212,800 ounces for the full year well above the top end of guidance range driven by the outperformance from La Yaqui Grande, Production from the La Yaqui Grande totaled 33,700 ounces in the fourth quarter and 153,400 ounces for the year, well ahead of expectations reflecting higher than planned mining rates and positive grade reconciliation. All-in sustaining costs were slightly above annual guidance in the fourth quarter, but well within the range of guidance on a full year basis, reflecting the exceptional performance from La Yaqui Grande. The mine site free cash flow totaled $27 million in the quarter and $142 million for the full year, As outlined earlier in the year, production guidance for the Mulatos district was increased 14% to between 160,170 thousand ounces.\nAs previously guided, this is down year-over-year, reflecting the end of mining in the main Mulatos pit and stocking of stockpile ore. The increase in production guidance was driven by higher expected production to residual leaching of the main Mulatos leach pad. The additional ounces recovered through residual leaching carry higher reported costs, however, are very profitable from a cash flow perspective that the majority of these costs previously incurred. I will now turn the call over to our VP of Exploration, Scott R.G. Parsons\nScott R.G. Parsons: Thank you, Luc. Moving over to Slide 12. We had another successful year on the exploration front across all of our assets with reserves increasing 2% to 10.7 million ounces of gold and grades also increasing 1%. The increase in reserve reflects higher grade additions at Island Gold and PDA and growth at Lynn Lake. This marks the fifth consecutive year the reserves have grown for a combined increase of 10%. Over that timeframe, we've discovered more than four million ounces of reserves, before mining depletion of three million ounces. Majority of these additions have been higher grade driving a 9% increase in grade, over that timeframe as our reserves continue to grow in both size and quality. Global measured indicated resources also increased by 12% to 4.4 million ounces with grades increasing 9%, reflecting higher grade additions at Island Gold and growth at Young-Davidson.\nSimilarly, inferred resources increased 3% to 7.3 million ounces. Moving to Slide 13, I'll note that significant pace of growth continued with reserves growing 18% to 1.7 million ounces and reserves and resources across all categories increasing 16% to 6.1 million ounces. These additions have at a very attractive discovery cost of $7 per ounce over the past year and $13 per ounce over the past five years. Including mining depletion, to-date 7.5 million ounces have been discovered at Island Gold, as it continues to establish itself as one of the highest grade and fastest growing deposits in the world. Over to slide 14, the growth in reserve and resources was driven by an expanded underground exploration drill program, targeting high-grade additions in proximity to existing underground infrastructure.\nThis included zones within the main Island Gold structure, which hosts the majority of the mineral reserves and resources as well as emerging opportunities outside of the main structure in the hanging-wall and the footwall. The program was successful on both fronts, with nearly one million ounces of high-grade gold discovered within the main structure and in the hanging-wall and footwall. As outlined in the long section, ongoing growth of the main structure occurred in Island East and Ireland West are two primary areas of focus. These additions are all near existing infrastructure will be low-cost developed and continue to increase our gold ounce per vertical meter profile. Furthermore, the gold mineralization within the main structure made open, both along strike and down plunge highlighting the excellent potential for this growth to continue.\nOver to Slide 15, expanded underground drill program also provided better access and more optimal drill orientations to target and expand the growing number of mineralized zones within the hanging-wall and footwall of the deposit. The program has been extremely successful with initial reserves and resources declared and expanded on a number of these recently defined zones, which have now become significant contributors to the overall growth of the deposits. In fact more than 600,000 ounces of high-grade reserves and resources were added in the originally defined Honeywell footwall zones, representing approximately 70% of the total increase in 2023. A few of the highlights, the growth in these zones include the NTH zones were 146,000 ounces were added including reserves of 53,000 ounces grading 12 grams per tonnes.\nThe E1D zone has more than doubled to contain 332,000 ounces of inferred resources grading 16 grams per tonnes and remains open in multiple directions. This zone is located on average 30 meters from the main structure, highlighting both the near-mine opportunity and the lower development costs. These zones and other targets within the hanging-wall and footwall represent significant opportunities for further growth. They're nearly 2,000 intersections about three grams per tonnes gold and five existing reserves and resources in the hanging-wall and footwall, highlighting the opportunity for further near mine high-grade additions and ongoing drilling for their test. These areas for the core on the bottom of this slide one of those opportunities and nearly 1,400 grams per tonnes over three meters which is one of the best intercepts drilled to date at Island Gold.\nThis is located 12 meters away from existing infrastructure is currently classified as an unknown zone, highlighting one of the many near-mine opportunities that we're following up on. Over to Slide 16, the PDA deposit represents the future of the Mulatos district and continues to grow, reflecting another year of exploration success. Mineral Reserves EBITDA increased 33% to one million ounces at 16% higher grades of 5.6 grams per tonne. Mineral reserves and resources now total 1.2 million ounces of PDA a 26% increase from 2022 and 116% increase over the past two years, with the deposit open in multiple directions and another significant exploration program planned at PDA in 2024, there's excellent potential for this growth to continue. This larger reserve base being incorporated into a development plan for PDA to be completed later this quarter and we expect well line another significant mine life extension at the Mulatos district.\nFollowing up on this broad-based exploration success and reflecting the potential we see across our assets, we've increased our global exploration budget to $62 million in 2024 the largest in the company's history. With that, I'll turn the call back over to John.\nJohn McCluskey: Thanks, Scott. That concludes our formal presentation. I will now turn the call back to the operator to open the call for questions.",

This is the conference operator. Welcome to B2Gold Corporation's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity for analysts to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Clive Johnson, President and CEO of B2Gold. Please go ahead, sir.\nClive Johnson: Thank you, Operator. Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We're here today, as the operator said, to discuss the fourth quarter 2023 financial results and also the full year of 2024. I want to start the call off by again extending the condolences to all those at B2Gold for the tragic loss of life in Mali February 15, there was an armed attack on a convoy of our buses and unfortunately four people were killed in the attack. So we'd like to extend our condolences to the families of those that passed and also our best wishes for the full recovery of the people that are in hospital. We are with the government working on an extensive investigation of what happened in the incident that happened about 300 km from the Fekola mine on the national highway, which is the way that many of the mines in the area and people in the area travel along the main highway.\nSo we've had a trouble spot there in the past. We've taken steps with the government to improve security. We will continue to work with the government to improve the security for our employees who is traveling to and from the mine. The investigation will help us understand the motivation of the attack who the attackers were, and with that report, which will be done shortly, we'll take some additional steps. The priority of B2Gold has always been for our 6,700 employees has always been the safety of our people, including transportation. We do have a top safety record on site, one of the better record track records in our industry. We're proud of that. We consider that safety is the number one priority. In terms of talking about the 2024, I'm going to hand off here shortly to Mike Cinnamond, our Chief Financial Officer, who's going to run through, give you a quick high-level overview, because the news release is quite extensive.\nWe'll talk about the record gold production in 2024, talk about the eight year in a row that the company has met or beaten its expectations our guidance, which is, I think, a tremendous track record that we intend to keep going into 2024 and beyond. 2024, as Michael talked about in 2023 results, just to touch on 2024, we've stabled for quite a while now that this is a bit of a transitional year with the construction of the Goose plant, but also with some various capital expenditures that we have in Fekola, for example, we were building another new tailings bond. We're building another extension to the solar plant. We have a bit lower production for this year because we didn't get the permits from the government, the export license from the government of Mali in time to produce the additional 80,000 to 100,000 ounces.\nWe were hoping to produce 2024 as we start trucking ore from the Fekola complex in the North Anaconda area, down to the Fekola mill. So we've been working with the government. We're hoping to get clarity from the government quite soon and move on to starting to truck that ore later this year. But we haven't put anything on 2024. We're starting that up in 2025, which could add 80,000 to 100,000 ounces to the annual gold production, significant amount of that, of course, to the benefit of the government of Mali. So we've had some positive meetings and we think we're closing in on understanding the implications of the 2023 mining gold, which code has grandfathered under the 2012 code. It's a very important, but the regional projects are subject to the new code because those are exploration licenses right now that need transfer.\nSo going into 2024, we are in an extremely strong financial position. And we were going at the end of the year, and subsequent to the year-end, we've completed a prepayment of gold revenue financing, which is an excellent way to further strengthen our financial position, given the large capital expenditures that we have this year from some of the things I talked about, but also obviously boost construction as well. So that financing was an excellent financing. It's around 3% cost of capital, and it is from any of our gold mines. And it represents about we paid back in 2025 and 2026, and it represents about 11% of our gold production during those years. And it was done at around 2020 price of gold. So I think a very effective financing. You've seen us do it before, back in the day when 2014, we pioneered this from the financing for the industry, which has subsequently been done by numerous companies.\nBut it is an excellent way to maintain a very strong balance sheet. And when you have significant capital expenditures coming, it's a cheap form of financing and exposes very little of our gold in terms of a small percentage of production being locked in those years. So 2025, we were looking to bounce back to another very strong year. Because of having the capital spends finished. Some of these are doing Fekola, et cetera. Goose schedule -- on schedule, start production in the first quarter of 2025. And we should set record gold production again in 2025 with Goose coming on and then better production, more with trucking ore better grade at Fekola getting into 2025 and much less capital expenditures across the Board. So I think with that, I'll pass it over to Mike to give you an overview of 2023, again, another very strong year for the company.\nAnd after Mike does his thing, then Bill, who's up at Goose, is going to give you a Goose update snowstorm dependent. He's still in this connection. And then we're going to open up for questions. So with that over to you, Mike.\nMike Cinnamond: Okay. Thanks, Clive. So we're going to start just the quarterly results, revenue for the quarter $512 million. We averaged just under $2,000 an ounce, $1,993. So thank you gold price. It's a good quarter and a good year for the gold price. I think for the full year, we came in $1.9 billion at an average price of $1,946 an ounce, which, when you think about the fact that we budgeted at $1,700 an ounce, that's a good result. Production wise for the quarter, gold produced from our operating mines, 271,000 and then 289,000, if you include our share of Calibre and I think production played out like we thought for Q4, the big winner was Fekola 143,000 ounces versus 109,000. And that's really Fekola as expected; we had some changes in timing there between Q3 and Q4 just with some delays.\nAt the end of Q3 and getting into Fekola's Phase 6, but we got in there in Q4, we got the grade we were expecting, kind of like we did the year before. And Fekola beat budget significantly by almost 35,000 ounces. And then if you look at Otjikoto for the quarter, I think for Otjikoto 81,000 ounces just a couple of thousand ounces higher than budget. But that's actually a quarterly record for Otjikoto. And it just reflects the fact that we got into the good grade. Both in the Otjikoto pit and the Wolfshag underground mine. Then looking at the full year pictures, again, kind of how we guided it, I think at Q3 total, including our share of Calibre 1,061 million ounces, which is in the upper half of our guidance range. And I would say again that that on a consolidated basis is a record annual production level for B2Gold.\nTalk a little bit now about what that all meant on the cost side, again, not spending too much time on this, because I think really these results ruled out what we saw through the year and what we guided in Q3 and what we expected for Q4. So in the quarter, the big winners on the cash cost side were Fekola and Masbate, Fekola with that additional production that came through and ability to sell it, $605 an ounce, quite a bit, $67 under budget, then Masbate $910 an ounce, which was $71 under budget. And overall, we came in for all of the operations; we came in $633 an ounces, which was $20 under budget. Continuing to benefit, I think, from lower fuel prices against budget that we saw. And then production beats -- every mine beat production slightly for the year.\nAnd when you look at the all-in sustaining cost side, it kind of mirrors what we're saying there. For all operations, including our share of Calibre $1,257 an ounce for the quarter, which was slightly above budget and it's really a function of two things. You've got the beat that we had on the cash cost side and then you got some CapEx that we were catching up on from prior quarters, particularly in Mali, where we had pretty significant CapEx year sustaining capital to get us ready to start moving into 2024 and beyond. So cost side, I'd say overall, when you look at total cost for the year, cash costs $654 an ounce. That's below our original guidance range for the full year, $670 to $730, so good result. Again, as we said, we thought we'd come out in Q4 at the end of Q3 and then all-in sustaining costs for the year, just $1,201 an ounce.\nAnd that's right at the low end of our consolidated guidance range of $1,195 to $1,255 per ounce. So really more of the same as we saw as we went through the year and very solid results from the operations. Comments on maybe a couple of the other operations where they are and couple of things to comment on before we get into other results, so at Fekola Regional, as Clive mentioned, we're still waiting to get licenses there. But I would say that we had 18,000 ounces in there as part of regional production and the current year's budget for 2023. And even though we weren't able to get in and access that, the performance of Fekola meant that overall for Fekola complex. We still met our guidance range for Fekola overall. And we have continued to work on regional through the year.\nWe have -- we got most of the mining infrastructure, the roads, the warehouses, workshops, built through the course of 2023, and we're just finishing that in the first quarter of 2024. So we're really well-positioned, I think, in terms of any trucking scenarios there for regional. Just waiting now for receipt of a mining license. Gramalote, as you know, in the year we bought Anglo of 50% of the Gramalote Project, so we own that 100% now and we're working on an updated PEA for that that we expect to have by the second quarter of 2024. Thinking about smaller scale operation with potentially smaller mill and better recovery and cost profile, smaller CapEx upfront. Bill is going to give us a Goose Project update, so I won't dwell on that right now.\nBut just to highlight Otjikoto again, Otjikoto is coming near the end of its open pit mine life. It's scheduled to ramp down in 2025. But we did put out a news release in January just highlighting that we did have very positive exploration drill results from the Antelope deposit that we're looking at now. And we think that with further drilling has the potential to be developed as an underground mining operation which could help us change the mix of the mill feed blend. As we move into the stockpile phase of Otjikoto, we hopefully will have more high grade from an underground deposit at Antelope if that comes through. Now, I'm just going to talk a little bit about some of the other results for the period. So on the earnings side, net income for shareholders for the quarter was negative $113 million as a result of impairment charge or $0.09 negative share, year-to-date, $10 million or $0.01 per share.\nThen adjusted net income once we removed the impact of any significant non-recurring non-cash items, $90 million for the Q, $0.07 a share or $346 million, $0.28 a share for the full year. In conjunction with that, and really reflecting how well the operations perform on the cash flow side, we had $714 million operating cash flow for the period, sorry, for the full year, including $205 million for Q4, and for full year cash flow from operations per share was $0.58, so again, very good performance by the site and getting that done. We found some good uses for it through the year. We -- if you recall some of the things we spent it on, we had the dividend, so we've got our $0.04 per share, USD per quarter dividend that turned in $186 million dividend payment for the full year.\nI remember, too, that as part of the Back River acquisition, there were certain financing obligations that we thought, because we believe in the future upside of that project that we wanted to buy out at inception. So that cost us just under $112 million earlier in the second quarter. And then on the investing side, a total for the full year of $845 million, which really reflects significant capital investment of Fekola as we continue to advance projects like the TSF, the Fekola underground, the Fekola solar Phase 2, and then, of course, the Goose Project as we came into that, and we've been working hard on that, and Bill will give us an update there. We did finish the year with $306 million cash in the bank, and that included drawing down on the line for $150 million in Q4 just in advance of some of the anticipated later Q4 expenses early Q1 expenses.\nAs Clive mentioned, we did do a prepaid financing early in Q1. So with that, we used a portion of that $500 million prepaid financing to pay down the outstanding balance on the line just a little later in January, early Feb. So that where we sit today is we've got the full $700 million line available, and we -- I'm catching the bank from the results of the prepaid financing as we move through the first couple of quarters, development continuing construction at various sites. One thing I will highlight, most significant transactions impacted Q4, so we did have an impairment for the Fekola Complex of just over $200 million, maybe a couple of comments on that. As we've mentioned through the year, there was a new 2023 Mali mining code that was enacted later in 2023 in the country.\nHowever, it was put into law, but there's an accompanying draft implementation decree which is currently out for industry comment. We provided feedback along with the other big Mali mining houses. It's not enacted yet, and exactly how some elements of the new code will be applied remains outstanding, could be subject to change. But we are where we are at this point in time. With that mining code being out there, what it did prompt us to do was examine later in the fourth quarter what were our plans for the Fekola Regional licenses. As we discussed previously, we thought about whether there is a -- we can build a second mill, oxide only mill at Fekola Regional, or whether we should look at a trucking scenario. As I mentioned, we already have that road infrastructure built, so should we look at a trucking scenario to the Fekola mill?\nAnd I think given the uncertainties about the new code and what we saw was in there, it's not as attractive for things like the tax and royalty regime and some new funds that they've built in there. We did a comparative analysis and we decided that for now, certainly, that trucking aboard from Fekola Regional to Fekola mill is the optimal scenario. In that trucking scenario, we see it's optimal because it really eliminates any significant mill CapEx exposure if we wanted to build, a mill while at the same time providing close to the similar cash flows from just trucking it down there and less capital upfront. So in looking at that, having done that trade-off and that analysis, that also prompted us then to update our current high level Fekola Mine and Fekola Regional mine plan, how we see production profiles coming from those.\nI'd highlight again that these are point in time estimates are the best estimates we have right now. It doesn't take into account future changes in variables, finalization of the 2023 code, production changes, cost changes, or further exploration success. We're still lots of plans to drill there and further define the oxide and even more importantly, perhaps the sulfides below those oxides to see how they can benefit both Fekola Regional production and Fekola production per se. And by looking at those new mine plans, they triggered an impairment review process. And key to highlight here, I think is that because both mine plans assumed that we will process or from both Regional and Fekola at the Fekola mill, we had to look at them jointly and for accounting purposes, they're treated as one combined cash flow generating unit.\nSo Fekola is the combination of the two. So we looked at that, looked at the plans, and the most significant impact in there is that the new regional licenses are all under the 2023 code, so they have to bear the regime that's under that current code as we know it, including the higher taxes and royalties. And overall, this resulted in a non-cash net impairment charge of just over $200 million for the combined Fekola Complex cash generating unit. And like all impairment assessments, we made our best estimates of a number of variables. You look at gold prices, appropriate discount rates for the country, and the 2023 code impact on them, and obviously for Regional, we looked at that, that was fully impacted by 2023 code. And for Fekola mine, we assumed that all stabilized factors under the 2012 code are still stabilized.\nSo that's our scenario. I can speak for each company in Mali because everyone has a slightly different scenario and where they are in their project life and new projects. For us, the most significant issue here is that we have new projects that we know would be pulled in under the new code. So I think those were the main items I was going to highlight. And if anyone has any questions, I'd be happy to answer them.\nClive Johnson: Sorry, do you want to --\nMike Cinnamond: Yes, we'll go to Bill first, then we'll open it up for questions. So, Bill, do we have you on the line?\nBill Lytle: You do? How do you hear me?\nMike Cinnamond: Fine.\nBill Lytle: Yes. Okay, so this is reporting in from the North Pole. I'm actually at the Goose site right now in anticipation of the winter road opening up. And so I am happy to say that the sides are point. They can see the stacks off of each other's equipment. So we anticipate that pending good weather for the next 48 hours, that the road will open up, that will not be fully opened up, but certainly the first lighter load to come down the road. So what we're doing now is we're in the process, on the MLA side of loading trucks ready to go. And so we can anticipate certainly this weekend that we will be seeing on the road. Everyone remembers that's in a good space. We've got double the number of trucks that we've had since last year and double the capacity.\nSo we think we're in really good -- all of the winter road equipment. Additionally here, the mill rights are in the mill, installing the mill, we've always -- remains three to four months. Most of the buildings are now completely putting in generators in the underground. The open pit is operating. The underground is looking good. The camp Phase 2 is getting ready to go. So that'll be some of the first pieces of equipment that come down the road. The Phase 2 camp, which will allow us to get to 500 beds. Just on costs, I don't have the latest numbers, but what I will tell you is that if you remember, we've pretty much de-risked the project because we've ordered all of the stuff, obviously, which is coming down the 2024 road. We're in the process of ordering \u2013[Technical Difficulty] shipping stuff basically on budget, which I think January, and we anticipate not seeing any mature scope or to budget.\nI don't know. Clive, there's anything else you want me to talk about?\nClive Johnson: I guess maybe just highlighting. You just did. But the fact that we've spent a lot of the capital and ordered a lot of equipment for the next year-and-a-half, so we've actually de-risked the project. But does anyone know how much money we've spent on the capital, estimated capital cost for Goose and how much that we've spent?\nMike Cinnamond: Well, cash spent to the end of the year was approximately $715 million for the Goose CapEx in total, including Sabina's share that they'd spent and what we spent post-acquisition.\nClive Johnson: And what -- how do we have left to spend our recent budget?\nMike Cinnamond: Well, we've got -- we\u2019ve given the budget estimate for CapEx for $1,050 for the main project, plus the funding of the development of the open pit and undergrounds, and also for some of the working capital funding that we think we need.\nClive Johnson: So Bill, I guess just to remind people about the schedule of the ice road starting here shortly, but how many weeks we have and how many weeks we think we have on that ice road and when do we think it'll wrap up or we'll have utilized it to the maximum.\nBill Lytle: So some of the numbers that we'd always talked about kind of a maximum of 3,000 containers, but we actually, that down [Technical Difficulty] 2,200 containers. That includes [Technical Difficulty] as I said, will be open and there will be open this weekend. And we have April or into the first week of May, assume that we're running 50 trucks or 48 trucks. What you're going to see is that we've got more than double the capacity to bring the load down the road. So ping is very good as far as bringing this.\nClive Johnson: You're bringing up a bit, Bill, but thanks for that. Just another couple of things to remind you of, we still have obviously as a company, one of our priorities and one of our great strengths is also exploration and our exploration success not only in finding more gold around our existing operations or mines or acquisitions we've made, but also making additional discoveries as a group, as a company over a long period of time. So we have an aggressive exploration button program. We have Victor King and Andy Brown with us here, if there's questions on exploration, we are pulling back on exploration in Maui. Mike mentioned we've far from realizing the ultimate value of the Fekola Complex. There's lots and lots of targets, lots of zones we've hit that are open.\nWe are drilling frankly. We've cut back dramatically on the drilling there because we don't understand yet the full implications of the 2023 code and understanding whether it might be an option to build a second mode down the road, et cetera. But trucking looks like the option. We're pursuing that, as we said, and hopefully we'll be able to start that sometime later this year. But the expiration, why would you go on and draw off lots more additional ounces when it's not clear whether they're economic, i.e. the second mill potential? So -- but we will get back to that if we forget where we want to get to with the government. I'm understanding that the 2023 code as written is going to be very detrimental to the future of the gold mining industry in Mali, because it will make it -- from being a very attractive company for foreign investment over many decades, make it one of the lesser attractive companies.\nWe have choices where we spend our money. Gramalote for example, if we get a good result in the study in the middle of the year. That could be a good project with owned 100% by beach of gold. But same expiration remains a priority to Goose expiration. I haven't seen Tom and Vic and Andy these guys as excited about an expression upside maybe since Cooper or some of the days at Fekola. But we have numerous targets, a big budget there. And we always knew the acquisition. We don't pay for ounces. That might be there in our acquisitions, but we think there's going to be a lot. We've already had one very good result. By drilling the deepest hole ever drilled on Umwelt and that was a really good result. I think it was 20 meters of 18 grams underneath the 100 meters below the deepest hole before wide open.\nAnd there's many other zones as well. So I think with that we'll open it up to questions. Okay. Well, while we wait --\nOperator: Yes, I can still hear you.\nClive Johnson: Okay.

Please see Table 1 for hole collar details and Figure 1, at end, for general zone locations.\nThe Mogoyafara South deposit contains open pit constrained inferred mineral resources 412,800 ounces* of gold grading 1.05 g/t Au making it the largest known gold deposit on the SMSZ Project to date. This deposit is open along strike and to depth and lies within a 2 km by 3 km area of structural rotation, which is a feature deemed positive for the gold deposition in most structurally-related gold camps. Two angled core holes, 252 meters and 287 meters deep, 100 meters apart, were drilled into an area where modeling suggested multiple stacked lenses of gold mineralization. Both holes intersected potentially gold-mineralized, silicified, sericitized and albitized siltstones, sandstones and conglomerates that are cut by occasional mafic and felsic dykes. One of the holes was designed to cross an intercept that returned 1.62 g/t Au over 11 meters (estimated true width). The 2nd drill hole represents an 80 m down-dip step out from a historic intercept of 1.22 g/t Au over 41 meters (estimated true width). Additional details will be presented once assay results have been received and analyzed.\nSampling at the Frikidi gold target returned 61 rock samples containing more than 5 g/t Au, five of which returned 100 g/t Au or greater**. Frikidi represents an area of numerous artisanal mine workings within a 5 km by 2.5 km, northwest-trending, cross-cutting, magnetic high area. Hole FAW-24-DD-001, a portion of which is presented below (Image 1), was drilled to test for shallow-dipping mineralized structures that were observed in the artisanal mine shafts. The quartz-veined portions of the core shown below, intersected from 23.9 meters to 39.0 meters, is consistent with gold-bearing rock grab samples that were collected on surface. The second hole was drilled to validate a historic drill intercept of 1.07 g/t Au over 26 meters (true width unknown), which may represent a new mineralized trend. Assays are pending.\nImage 1.

This week, with a relatively sparse macro data calendar, such was the case with an alternative to the ISM reporting, S&P Global's manufacturing and servicing reports.\nThe week started a little more in line with our expectations for the key drivers. After moderated trading on Monday saw gold holding a line along $2315/oz, disappointing headline numbers in the May Retail Sales report (including a downward revision into negative territory for the prior month's Retail Sales growth) boosted gold prices higher with the dual tailwinds of general economic uncertainty and the implication that (should this persist) the FOMC could be forced to ease monetary policy sooner and more rapidly than the Fed currently suggests. The yellow metal rode the wave higher to $2330 on Tuesday morning, where prices appeared to stabilize and consolidate, holding within a narrow band for all of Wednesday's lightly-traded US holiday.\nPrior to the release of S&P's PMI data on Friday morning, the data from similar but more regionally focused surveys provided signals that kept gold supported before eventually driving bids higher to a weekly top beyond $2360 on Thursday night. The regional manufacturing surveys from both the New York and Philadelphia branches of the Fed disappointed against projections, lending steam to the argument that the US economy may be starting to falter more significantly under the strain of elevated interest rates.",

U.S. Treasury yields gained ground after a weak auction. They had risen earlier after data showed U.S. consumer confidence unexpectedly improved in May amid optimism about the labor market after deteriorating for three consecutive months. In addition, U.S. house price growth slowed sharply in March, likely as rising mortgage rates weighed on demand.

They had risen earlier after data showed U.S. consumer confidence unexpectedly improved in May amid optimism about the labor market after deteriorating for three consecutive months.\nIn addition, U.S. house price growth slowed sharply in March, likely as rising mortgage rates weighed on demand.\nEquity investors were most focused on waiting for price data that is not due out until Friday. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation barometer, the U.S. core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index report, is expected to hold steady on a monthly basis for April.\n\"It's a holiday-shortened week so volume is likely to be pretty low all week. That's combined with the fact that markets are focused on one key data point due out Friday,\" said Gene Goldman, chief investment officer at Cetera Investment Management in El Segundo, California, referring to Monday's U.S. Memorial Day holiday.\n\"The market is anxiously sitting on the sidelines waiting to get confirmation that inflation is slowing towards the Fed's target,\" Goldman said.\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe fell 1.28 points, or 0.16%, to 792.07.\nStill, on Wall Street, the Nasdaq managed to rise past 17,000 level, and close above it for the first time as AI leader Nvidia hit a record high.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 216.73 points, or 0.55%, to 38,852.86, the S&P 500 gained 1.32 points, or 0.02%, to 5,306.04 and the Nasdaq Composite gained 99.09 points, or 0.59%, to 17,019.88.\nMore in Business\nEarlier Europe's STOXX 600 index closed down 0.6%.\nIn Treasuries, yields rose after two lackluster debt auctions raised doubts about demand for U.S. government debt while investors also digested the economic data, which fueled uncertainty about the Fed's monetary policy outlook.\n\"With $297 billion in nominal supply on Tuesday between coupons and bills, I think some indigestion is to be expected,\" said Tom Simons, U.S. economist at Jefferies in New York.\nThe yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes rose 6.7 basis points to 4.54%, from 4.473% late on Friday, while the 30-year bond yield rose 7.9 basis points to 4.656%.\nThe 2-year note yield, which moves in step with interest rate expectations, rose 2.1 basis points to 4.9742%.\nIn currencies, the dollar index gave back earlier losses as Treasury yields rose and managed a slight gain.\n\"The bond market has turned around (on Tuesday) and the dollar with it,\" said Adam Button, chief currency analyst at ForexLive in Toronto, citing the weak auctions and noting that the improving consumer confidence report reflects \"stronger growth.\"\nThe index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro, gained 0.04% at 104.60, with the euro unchanged at $1.0858.\nAgainst the Japanese yen, the dollar strengthened 0.18% at 157.14.\nOil prices gained more than $1 a barrel on the expectation that OPEC+ will maintain crude supply curbs at its June 2 meeting, while the start of U.S. summer driving season and a weaker dollar also boosted the commodity. [O/R]\nU.S. crude futures settled up 2.71% at $79.83 a barrel while Brent settled at $84.22, up 1.35%.\nGold prices rose slightly, as spot gold gained 0.33% to $2,358.58 an ounce. U.S. gold futures gained 1.17% to $2,359.70 an ounce.\n(Reporting by Sin\u00e9ad Carew, Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss, Karen Brettell, Johann M Cherian, Lisa Pauline Mattackal, Alun John, Stella Qiu; Editing by Jacqueline Wong, Edwina Gibbs, Ana Nicolaci da Costa, Will Dunham, Alison Williams and Deepa Babington)",

These ores will be used to conduct additional metallurgical testing and pilot work to validate recent optimizations and support detailed engineering and an updated Feasibility Study for the vertically integrated NICO cobalt-gold-bismuth-copper Critical Minerals project in Canada (\"NICO Project\"). Intermediate test products produced from NICO Project ores and concentrates will also be blended with metal precipitates sourced from Rio Tinto\u2019s Kennecott Smelter in Utah to assess the feasibility of processing these materials to recover additional bismuth and cobalt at Fortune\u2019s planned hydrometallurgical refinery in Alberta (\"Alberta Refinery\"). Successful validation of the Fortune optimizations and processing of Rio Tinto precipitates would increase Critical Mineral production and revenues and reduce waste disposal costs for the planned Alberta Refinery.\nLike our news? Click-to-post-on-X.\nThe NICO Project is an advanced development stage asset comprised of a planned open pit and underground mine and concentrator in the NWT and a hydrometallurgical refinery in Alberta to process metal concentrates from the mine and other compatible sources to value-added products. Development of the NICO Project would provide a North American supply of three Critical Minerals needed for the energy transition, new technologies, and growing green economy. The Mineral Reserves for the NICO Deposit also contain more than one million ounces of gold, the price for which has recently exceeded historic highs, providing a highly liquid and countercyclical co-product to mitigate Critical Mineral price volatility.\nFortune prepared approximately 15 metric tonnes of ores from its existing stockpiles at the NICO Deposit in 2023, which were recently slung 10 km by helicopter to trucks on the winter ice road for haulage to SGS Canada Inc. for the completion of the first phase of the metallurgical program. The samples are being inspected for quality assurance, and this will be followed by crushing, grinding, and flotation to make gold-bearing cobalt and bismuth sulphide concentrates during phase two of the program. Phase three will consist of hydrometallurgical processing of the concentrates to address gaps needed for detailed engineering and validate process optimizations, including precipitation of a clean gypsum by-product from the autoclave waste residue to reduce disposal costs at the Alberta Refinery. Rio Tinto has also successfully demonstrated precipitation of a bismuth intermediate product from Kennecott smelter wastes in Utah. These will be blended with Fortune test products at SGS Canada Inc. to validate the recovery of the contained metals using the Alberta Refinery metallurgical flow sheet. A portion of Fortune\u2019s costs for the metallurgical test work is being reimbursed by the Government of Canada with a grant from the Critical Minerals Research, Development and Demonstration (\"CMRDD\") program. Alberta Innovates is also providing financial support through their Clean Resources Continuous Intake Program (see Fortune News Release, dated December 5, 2023, and Natural Resources Canada News release, dated March 23, 2024).\nFortune has also secured an additional extension to the purchase option it has with JFSL Field Services ULC (\"JFSL\") to acquire its brownfield industrial site in Lamont County, Alberta where it plans to construct the Alberta Refinery (see news release dated January 24, 2022). This 77-acre site has 42,000 square feet of serviced shops and buildings adjacent to the Canadian National Railway and is close to sources of reagents, skilled labour, and utilities already in place to service the Alberta petrochemicals industry and a nickel-cobalt refinery operated by another mining company. The JFSL site is an ideal location to construct the Fortune refinery and expand the Edmonton area as a Critical Minerals processing hub in western Canada. Fortune can complete the purchase of the JFSL facilities before May 15, 2024 by paying C$5.5 million, less payments already made, and subject to JFSL\u2019s right to use the facilities during the eighteen months following Fortune\u2019s completion of the purchase option.\nThe NICO Project will provide a North American vertically integrated supply of cobalt sulphate needed to make the cathodes of lithium-ion batteries powering electric vehicles, portable electronics, and stationary storage cells. The development will also help mitigate concerns over the current sources of supply, notably including geographic concentration of 77% of global cobalt mine production in the politically unstable Democratic Republic of the Congo and China\u2019s control over 80% of the world\u2019s refined cobalt supply.\nThe NICO Deposit contains 12% of global bismuth reserves and is the largest deposit of this metal in the world. Production from the NICO Project would mitigate policy risks associated with China\u2019s control over 75% of current bismuth production and provide a North American supply alternative that is exempt from the 25% U.S. Government tariff on Chinese imports. Bismuth has unique physical and chemical properties leveraged by the automotive, construction and pharmaceutical industries. Consumption of bismuth is growing as an environmentally safe and non-toxic replacement for lead in brass, solder, free-machining steel and aluminum, paints and pigments, glass, radiation shielding, and ammunition. Bismuth demand is also growing to make high-density metal plugs used to permanently seal decommissioned oil and gas wells to prevent greenhouse gas leakage and blowouts. An important developing market is the use of bismuth in permanent magnets to provide a superior and lower cost alternative to rare earth element magnets used in direct current electric vehicle motors.\nFor more detailed information about the NICO Mineral Reserves and certain technical information in this news release, please refer to the Technical Report on the NICO Project, entitled \"Technical Report on the Feasibility Study for the NICO-Gold-Cobalt-Bismuth-Copper Project, Northwest Territories, Canada\", dated April 2, 2014 and prepared by Micon International Limited which has been filed on SEDAR and is available under the Company's profile at www.sedar.com.

His last trade under the plan was conducted on Wednesday, where he sold 39,538 shares for approximately $8 million.\nThis transaction took his total share sales since July to the planned 25 million, marking the end of the current plan.\nWhile Amazon has chosen not to comment on the stock sales, investors are eagerly awaiting the announcement of a new plan, possibly in Amazon\u2019s next quarterly report.\nDespite the massive sales, Bezos still holds over a billion Amazon shares, valued at $213 billion.\nWhy It Matters: Bezos\u2019 massive sell-off of Amazon shares, totaling $5.1 billion since July, has been a topic of interest among investors.\nThe sales were conducted under a prearranged 10b5-1 trading plan, which is commonly used by large shareholders to avoid accusations of insider trading.\nThe completion of this plan ahead of schedule has sparked anticipation for the announcement of a new plan, potentially to be revealed in Amazon\u2019s upcoming quarterly report.\nDespite the large-scale sales, Bezos remains a major shareholder in Amazon, with over a billion shares valued at $213 billion.\nRead Next:\n-\nArrived Home's Private Credit Fund\u2019s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate.

Gold prices popped by even less.\nWhether re-routed shipping stokes price rises in other goods is an open question, but it has not filtered through to wider market sentiment yet.\nEven the slightly hot U.S. consumer price inflation report for December was batted away quite quickly on Thursday. U.S. annual headline and core inflation rates were a smidgen higher than forecast, even though the latter did indeed drop below 4% for the first time since May 2021.\nFar from sowing seeds of caution in markets, Federal Reserve rate cut bets actually went up a gear. More than 150 basis points of cuts this year are back fully priced into futures curves, the odds on a March cut went up, and two-year Treasury yields dived to their lowest this year at 4.24%.\nThe rates retreat buoyed Wall St stocks, which closed only marginally in the red, and knocked back the dollar a bit. Futures are flat ahead of Friday's open.\nWith weekly jobless updates also sparky, it was less than clear why markets reacted to an irksome CPI that way.\nWhile not yet chiming with market easing bets, Fed officials didn't seem bothered enough by the CPI readout to change their existing tone and some economists, such as Deutsche Bank, reckoned an outsize spur to CPI from shelter prices is less of an issue for Fed-favoured PCE inflation measures.\n\"When we have weeks or months of data to come, I don't like tying our hands,\" Chicago Fed boss Austan Goolsbee told Reuters. \"We don't make decisions about March, June and whatever, in January.\"\nWhatever the real reason for the market take, they get a second view of inflation pressures later on Friday as a likely more subdued U.S. producer price report for December is released.\nAnd whatever price pressures are still evident in U.S. and other western economies, there's none at all in China - consumer prices there declined for a third month in December while factory-gate prices extended their prolonged deflationary slide with a surprisingly large annual drop.",

Adding to unease is a migration crisis at Poland's border with Belarus, which Polish authorities view being engineered by the governments of Russia and Belarus.\nRadoslaw Paklikowski, a 38-year-old entrepreneur in the western Polish city of Wroclaw, began buying gold and silver coins in 2021 and now invests 5% of his assets in precious metals.\n\u201cHaving real physical gold is important, and by that I don't mean a ton of gold, but an amount that will help you cross the border or make your family safe if anything will happen,\" he said.\nMembership in NATO gives some a feeling of security. Still, many in this region once under Moscow's control worry that if Russia prevails in Ukraine it won't stop there.\nWhile governments beef up defenses and send weapons to Ukraine, regular people are seeking protection. Some with means have bought homes in Spain and Italy.\nUnlike investments in real estate or artwork in Poland, gold, diamonds and silver can be easily moved.\nIn Poland, gold's allure is intertwined with the enduring trauma of World War II, when it could ensure survival.\nStories are still told in families of relatives who survived thanks to gold jewelry or coins which allowed them to buy food or cross borders to safety when the country was under occupation by German and Soviet forces. Nearly 6 million Polish citizens were killed in that war, among them most of Poland\u2019s Jews.\nMarta Bassani-Prusik, head of precious metals trade at the Mint of Poland, said her clients include Poles who recall such family histories, as well as people with Polish roots who return to see the land of their ancestors, some of whom fled the Warsaw Ghetto.\n\u201cThey say that they are alive only because of the gold, because their grandparents had a gold bar or a gold coin,\u201d she said.\nShe said the market for investment gold bars and coins was slow in the years before COVID-19, but took off with the pandemic and war \u201cbecause everybody was afraid of what was happening.\u201d\nJust when the gold market was leveling off, it got another boost from post-pandemic inflation, which reached over 18% in Poland.\nThe price of gold is volatile like stocks and investors can lose if they buy high and have to sell low, and it can get lost or stolen. Since it is priced in dollars on a global market, like oil, currency fluctuations can add to the risks for some.\nThat it remains attractive attests to its universal allure, and gold has surged from around $1,300 per Troy ounce \u2014 which is 31 grams and the standard for measuring precious metals \u2014 to over $2,300 over the past decade.\nThe rise is increasingly driven by demand from individuals and central banks in Asia, according to Michal Teklinski, an expert at Goldsaver, a popular new branch of investment gold dealer Goldenmark Group that allows clients to buy physical gold in instalments.\nTeklinski predicts prices will continue to rise in coming years because central banks in China and many emerging markets are increasing their gold reserves.\nAmid the global boom, the market for physical gold in Poland has been one of the strongest in Europe after 2020, only after Germany, Switzerland and Austria, fueled by rising wealth and a distrust of authorities. \u201cAfter 2020, people started to go back to their roots,\u201d he said.\nThe Mint of Poland, which has operated since 1766, was once a state venture but was privatized after the fall of communism and is now listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.

During the market sell-off in 2022, CBS News reported that 401(k) and IRA plan participants experienced an estimated loss of around $3 trillion.\nDespite these ominous predictions, Kiyosaki has offered some advice for navigating the potential crisis.\n\u201cBuy gold, silver, Bitcoin while you still can,\u201d he suggested.\nLet\u2019s take a quick look at this trio of assets.\nGold and silver\nPrecious metals \u2014 particularly gold and silver \u2014 have long been considered a popular hedge against inflation. The reason is simple: They can\u2019t be printed out of thin air like fiat money.\nKiyosaki has long been a fan of gold and first purchased the yellow metal in 1972. He has explained in the past it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t \u201ctrust\u201d the Federal Reserve, which controls the supply of money. He made headlines recently when he revealed he's $1.2 billion in debt. \"I use debt as money and don\u2019t save cash because in 1971 the dollar became debt,\" he said in an Instagram video. President Richard Nixon put an end to dollar convertibility to gold in 1971, making it a free-floating currency.\nIn October, Kiyosaki predicted, \u201cGold will soon break through $2,100 and then take off. You will wish you had bought gold below $2,000. Next stop gold $3,700.\u201d",

Record high gold prices are up about 12% in 2024 and the CRB core commodity index is up 15%.\nEven though U.S. crude oil prices have backed off a little from last week's 2024 high, they are still up more than 20% since the start of the year.\nThe positive twist for commodity stocks in the resource based sector is offset by the additional headache this gives central bankers already wary about inflation stuck stubbornly above 2% targets.\nMinneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, who last week said there may be no rate cuts this year if inflation continues to move sideways, reiterated his stance overnight and said the Fed cannot stop short on its inflation fight.\nJPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon struck a similar note in his annual letter to shareholders this week, saying the resilient economy, high public spending and disruptive geopolitics \"may lead to stickier inflation and higher rates than markets expect\".\nThere was little clarity from the latest New York Fed survey on Monday. The poll showed the public sees inflation a year from now at 3%, unchanged from the prior month, but they raised their three-year view to 2.9% while cutting the five year outlook to as low as 2.6%.\nHowever, the survey also showed creeping nervousness about job security and debt repayments.\nAnd this was something dovish Chicago Fed chief Austan Goolsbee chimed with on Monday too, saying the U.S. central bank must weigh how much longer it can maintain its current interest rate stance without it damaging the economy.",

Economists don\u2019t expect rate cuts until the final quarter of this year and predict the RBI will likely only move after the US Federal Reserve pivots.\nCitigroup Inc. economists now see the RBI shifting to a neutral stance only in August rather than its earlier projection of June.\n\u201cWaiting until August for stance change would help RBI avoid any early market pricing of rates cuts, a better view of monsoon and the global monetary policy dynamics,\u201d Citigroup economists Samiran Chakraborty and Baqar Zaidi wrote in a note. They expect July-August inflation data to be well below 4%, largely due to base effects, providing a more favorable backdrop for the central bank to move.\nFood prices, which make up about half of the consumer price basket, rose 8.7% in April from a year ago, slightly higher than 8.52% in March. Excluding the volatile food and fuel components, consumer prices rose 3.25% in April from a year earlier, little changed from 3.26% in March, according to calculations from Bloomberg Economics.\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says\nA further drop in most components of core inflation and fuel inflation countered a sharp jump in gold prices and a slight uptick in food inflation. While an overly restrictive monetary policy is constraining demand, elevated and rising food inflation is likely to keep the Reserve Bank of India from implementing a policy pivot at its June review.\nAbhishek Gupta, India economist\nFor the full report, click here\nUpasna Bhardwaj, an economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd., said erratic weather and heat waves \u201cshould keep the overall sentiment cautious\u201d around rate cuts. \u201cWe do not expect much change to RBI\u2019s narrative for now as a prolonged pause in policy rates remains the base case,\u201d she said.\nIndia\u2019s election, which runs until June 1, also complicates the timing of any central bank easing. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is seeking to extend his decade in power by another five years, promising to boost investment in infrastructure to keep the economy expanding at a rapid pace. Election results are expected on June 4, and the RBI\u2019s next rate decision is scheduled for June 7.\nOther highlights from the CPI data:\nFuel and light prices fell 4.24% in April from a year earlier after dropping 3.35% in March\nClothing and footwear prices rose 2.85%\nHousing prices gained 2.68%, little changed from the previous month\n(Updates with comment from economists.)\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\nHow the \u2018Harvard of Trading\u2019 Ruined Thousands of Young People\u2019s Lives\nCheap Prison Labor Is Keeping People Locked Up Longer, Suit Alleges\n\u2018The Caitlin Clark Effect Is Real,\u2019 and It\u2019s Already Changing the WNBA\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.",

Where might prices go when ETF allocators return?\nSource: Bloomberg, 30 March\nThis weakness in demand, however, has been more than offset by central governments and retail investors in Asian markets such as China.\nDespite interest rates at levels not seen in well over a decade, we believe there are several reasons why the price of gold is likely to continue to rise. Government liabilities continue to rise as demographic tailwinds of the last four decades become headwinds.\nAt the same time, fiscal spending and government deficits are increasingly likely to be funded by money that does not exist. That is, governments will most likely fund their liabilities by printing money.\nThis debt monetization devalues the value of fiat currencies, the direct consequence being asset price inflation. Chart 2 shows how the increase in the price of gold has not held up with the enormous amount of money printed by central banks.\nChart 2: Growth in global central bank assets has far outstripped the growth in the value of gold since the end of the euro-crises\nSource: Bloomberg, Shard Capital, 29 February Right axis: Gold price in US dollars/ounce; Left Axis: Central bank assets in billions of US dollars\nConsidering more government debt is likely to end up on the balance sheets of central banks, the upper bound for gold is still a long way off!\nGold also offers protection against unpredictable and potentially significant events that can have a sudden and adverse impact on financial markets, economies or geopolitical stability.",

The dollar jumped back to its best level since mid May and that in turn triggered a reversal in lofty gold prices - clocking their worst day in month and worst week of the year.\nThe VIX bounced back more than a point from pre-pandemic lows.\nA so-called \"bear-flattening\" of the yield curve saw the inversion of the 2-10 year yield gap deepen to its most negative this year - with yields at both tenures rising but short rates up by more.\nThe yield curve has been inverted for almost two years solid now and its reliability as a harbinger of recession has been shot to bits - underscoring the peculiarity of this particular cycle and how the Fed may be struggling to cool it down.\nAhead of the U.S. Memorial Day holiday on Monday, all the major price indicators have given back a bit of Thursday's moves - with S&P futures up 0.2% ahead of the bell and both Treasury yields and the dollar off a touch.\nBut the Fed rate jitters rippled across the world overnight, with bourses in Tokyo, Seoul, Hong Kong and Shanghai losing more than 1% on Friday.\nChina's ongoing military exercises around Taiwan have not helped investor confidence.\nEurope's two-day loss continued - with regional interest rate and political concerns of its own.\nEven though the European Central Bank is still nailed on to deliver its first rate cut next month, unexpected strength in May business readings and a surprising acceleration of negotiated wage settlements in the first quarter have dragged market pricing for full-year ECB easing back below 60bp.",

Wood also added a new bull case that includes the potential highest price Bitcoin could reach by 2030 if companies allocated 5% to Bitcoin.\nTrending: \u2018Scrolling to UBI': Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones \u2013 invest today with $1,000 for just $0.25/share\nWith Bitcoin trading at $89,384.76 at the time of writing, an investor could buy 0.00112 BTC today with $100.

There will be no public offering of any of the securities mentioned in this news release in the United States.\nTORONTO, May 13, 2024 /CNW/ - Orvana Minerals Corp. (TSX: ORV) (the \"Company\" or \"Orvana\") reports consolidated financial and operational results for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 (\"Q2 FY2024\").\nThis news release contains only a summary of the Company's financial and operations results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024, and readers should refer to the full set of unaudited consolidated financial statements for the six months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, and accompanying management's discussion and analysis (MD&A), available on www.sedarplus.ca and on the Company's website at www.orvana.com. All financial figures contained herein are expressed in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.\nJuan Gavidia, CEO of Orvana Minerals Corp. stated: \"During the second quarter Orovalle improved its advance and backfilling performance, and we have expectations of further operational improvements as the year progresses, resulting in anticipated increased tonnage mined. Based on the production plan for the second half of the year, we expect to exceed the copper production guidance, and we should be reaching the lower end of the gold guidance. Additionally, I am happy to announce that we are expecting to meet our annual unitary costs guidance\".\n\"At Bolivia, permitting, engineering and supply processes are ready to start construction of the Don Mario Plant expansion in July 2024, subject to close sufficient funding. We expect to provide news about the Bonds Program, core of the financing structure, in the following weeks\", he added.\nHighlights\nOrovalle - Spain\nProduction of 10,101 gold equivalent ounces[1] (7,775 gold ounces, 1.1 million copper pounds and 26,728 silver ounces) was 6% higher when compared to 9,550 gold equivalent ounces[1] (\"GEO\") in the previous quarter. The increase was mainly due to higher copper grade.\nQ2 FY2024 throughput of 136,371 tonnes was in line with the first quarter of fiscal 2024, but 23% below the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Main causes of the low tonnage were:\nThe 3-hour stoppages per shift strike that had commenced in mid-November 2023 and were halted in January 2024, upon agreement to the basic terms of the 2023-2025 Collective Bargain Agreement (\"CBA\").\nHigh levels of absenteeism, negatively impacting operational performance. The absenteeism increase is in line with the national trends in Spain. The Company is reinforcing recruitment and on boarding programs, to minimize the time required to cover temporary vacancies.\nLow level of availability of machinery, mainly due to turnover of experienced technical personnel. The Company is working on different initiatives to reinforce the maintenance team, with direct employees and additional technical services.\nGold grade was below the plan for the quarter, and copper grade was above the plan for the quarter, as a result of a different ore blend, with lower percentage of oxides and higher percentage of skarn than initially planned. The Company rescheduled the mining sequence of the second quarter with higher percentage of skarn, in order to allocate equipment resources to backfill activities to increase oxides areas available for the second half of the fiscal year.\nDuring the second quarter Orovalle rescheduled the production plan until September 2024, and continues focused on improving mining operational ratios, targeting to increase the monthly throughput to 58,000 tonnes in average over the second half of fiscal 2024. At the same time, the Company continues working on the operational efficiencies planned for the year.\nFiscal 2024 production guidance:\nOn track to meet higher end of copper guidance of 3,300 \u2013 3,700 k lbs.\nTargeting to reach lower end of gold guidance of 41,000 - 45,000 oz.\nDon Mario - Bolivia\nOrvana continues focused on restarting production at Don Mario. The Oxides Stockpile Project (the \"OSP\"), consisting of a plant expansion to treat ore stockpiled in the Don Mario Operation from previous years of mining activity, is projected to operate for 35 months, starting after a 13-month construction period that the Company expects to start in July 2024, subject to the completion of sufficient financing.\nThe proposed OSP financing structure includes:\n$47 million Bonds Program, as the structure core, for CAPEX;\n$3 million Bank Debt: during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 EMIPA secured a financing line with Banco FIE in Bolivia and $1.5 million of that line were withdrawn during that quarter; and\n$33 million working capital facility during construction and ramp-up phases. During Q2 FY2024 the Company continued exploring different potential financing sources, including without limitation, equity at the EMIPA's level and a prepayment facility.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2023, EMIPA initiated the process for the issuance of the US $47 million Bond Program to be issued through the Bolivian Stock Market. In September 2023, EMIPA received the Autoridad de Supervisi\u00f3n del Sistema Financiero (\"ASFI\") approval of its registration as an eligible Bond Issuer in the Bolivian Stock Market. In November 2023, ASFI approved EMIPA's proposed Bond Program to be offered in the Bolivian stock market. In February 2024 EMIPA notified the market in Bolivia of its intention to commence the Bonds Offering in the Bolivian Stock Exchange. EMIPA's agent, Panamerican Securities, S.A. will conduct the financing on a best efforts basis. The minimum placement amount of the Bonds Offering is 80% of the approximately US $47 million offering. As of the date hereof, EMIPA continues to seek financing for the OSP. There can be no assurance that EMIPA's efforts will result in adequate financing for the OSP. Updates on the status of EMIPA's financing efforts will be provided as material information develops from time to time.\nIn September 2023, the Autoridad de Supervision del Sistema Financiero (ASFI), Bolivia's financial regulator, approved and registered EMIPA as an eligible bond issuer on the Bolivian stock market. As a registered bond issuer on the Bolivian stock market, EMIPA is required to file its quarterly financial statements with ASFI. The purpose of registering EMIPA as an eligible bond issuer is to provide the subsidiary with the ability to raise funds from the sale of bonds in Bolivia to finance OSP as described above.\nAs an eligible bond issuer on the Bolivian stock market, EMIPA has filed its unaudited financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 (the \"EMIPA Q2 FY2024\"), which may be viewed at the following ASFI landing page (the \"ASFI Page\") when published by ASFI and available for viewing: https://www.asfi.gob.bo/index.php/registro-rmv/mv-entidades-inscritas-en-el-rmv.html\nTo search for EMIPA's financial statements, select the following at the ASFI Page:\nENTIDADES REGULADAS \u2013 EMISORES: Empresa Minera Paitit\u00ed, S.A. EMIPA\nVer: Estados Financieros\nTaguas - Argentina\nOrvana is analyzing a strategic option to combine oxides and sulphides in a larger undertaking strategy at Taguas. During Q2 FY2024 the Company continued working on enhancing the analytics of the sulphides zone of the deposit, and a new geological modeling is in progress. Next steps would include spectral analysis campaign to improve alteration types definition, and geo-metallurgical tests with oxide and sulphide ores. Once the oxides \u2013 sulphides combined opportunity is understood, next steps for the project will be determined.\nSelected Financial Information\nQuarters ended | Variance % | Six Months ended | Variance % | ||||\nMarch 31, 2024 | March 31, 2023 | March 31, 2024 | March 31, 2023 | ||||\nGEO 1 | 10,101 | 14,470 | (30 %) | 19,651 | 28,285 | (31 %) | |\nConsolidated Financial Performance (in 000's) | |||||||\nRevenue | 15,927 | 22,304 | (29 %) | 36,051 | 45,282 | (20 %) | |\nMining costs | 13,663 | 18,205 | (25 %) | 31,590 | 37,045 | (15 %) | |\nComprehensive (loss) income | 875 | (845) | 204 % | (5,059) | 126 | (4,115 %) | |\nEBITDA 1 | 1,889 | 3,750 | (50 %) | 1,936 | 6,486 | (70 %) | |\nCash provided by operating activities | 1,282 | 1,262 | 2 % | 1,072 | 4,949 | (78 %) | |\nCapital expenditures (cash basis) | 2,063 | 1,502 | 37 % | 4,535 | 4,589 | (1 %) | |\nCash (used in) provided by financing activities | 295 | (662) | 145 % | (1,336) | (3,798) | 65 % | |\nTotal assets | 116,042 | 130,300 | (11 %) | 116,042 | 130,300 | (11 %) | |\nCurrent liabilities | 38,839 | 42,281 | (8 %) | 38,839 | 42,281 | (8 %) | |\nNon-current liabilities | 25,703 | 33,711 | (24 %) | 25,703 | 33,711 | (24 %) | |\nOrovalle | |||||||\nCOC 1 ($/oz) | 1,723 | 1,438 | 20 % | 1,711 | 1,370 | 25 % | |\nAISC 1 ($/oz) | 2,094 | 1,691 | 24 % | 1,975 | 1,642 | 20 % | |\nConsolidated | |||||||\nCOC 1 ($/oz) | 1,812 | 1,524 | 19 % | 1,796 | 1,452 | 24 % | |\nAISC 1 ($/oz) | 2,157 | 1,893 | 14 % | 2,155 | 1,838 | 17 % |\n1 Gold Equivalent Ounces (GEO), EBITDA, cash costs per ounce (COC) and all-in sustaining costs (AISC) per ounce are Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures.

This rally was further fueled by a weakening US dollar and expectations of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Gold prices reached a record high of $2,135.39 per ounce in December. After continuous interest rate hikes that brought the Federal Reserve funds rate to its highest level in over 22 years, policymakers have signaled plans for at least three rate cuts in 2024. Natasha Kaneva, Head of Global Commodities Strategy at J.P. Morgan, commented:\n\u201cCommodities are unlikely to benefit from core inflation in 2024. Inflation should fall to under 3%, so that, along with properly timing the business cycle, are the two conditions needed to initiate long positions, making the outlook for the sector very tactical in 2024. Across commodities, for the second consecutive year, the only structural bullish call we hold is for gold and silver.\u201d\nReflecting similar market sentiment, Gregory Shearer, Head of Base and Precious Metals Strategy at J.P. Morgan, stated:\n\u201cAcross all metals, we have the highest conviction on a bullish medium-term forecast for both gold and silver over the course of 2024 and into the first half of 2025, though timing an entry will continue to be critical. At the moment, gold still appears quite rich relative to underlying rates and foreign exchange (FX) fundamentals, and still looks vulnerable to another modest retreat in the near-term, as Fed rate cut expectations are now running earlier than our forecasts.\u201d\nIn 2023, gold showcased strength despite expectations, outperforming multiple assets including commodities, bonds, and most stock markets. The World Gold Councilhighlighted that market consensus leans towards a 'soft landing' in the US, historically not favorable for gold returns, although geopolitical tensions and continued central bank buying may provide support. However, the possibility of the Fed achieving a soft landing with interest rates above 5% remains uncertain, with a global recession still possible, prompting investors to consider gold as an effective hedge. While the odds favor a soft landing, historical data shows it has been achieved only twice following nine tightening cycles, indicating potential challenges. The World Gold Council noted that the labor market's status is crucial in determining economic conditions, with potential shifts from a soft to a hard landing. Other possible scenarios include a 'no landing,' characterized by reaccelerated inflation and growth, which could initially challenge gold. Expected policy rate easing may not translate as favorably for gold due to factors like real interest rates and consumer demand constraints. A recession, if it occurs, historically benefits high-quality government bonds and gold, though initially, it might pose challenges for gold. However, if inflation surges, it could lead to a stronger monetary response, reinforcing the case for strategic gold allocations.\nGoldman Sachs Researchexpects gold prices to rise due to increased central bank purchases and robust retail demand in emerging markets. Analysts Nicholas Snowdon and Lavinia Forcellese predict a potential 6% climb in gold prices over the next year to reach $2,175 per troy ounce. While uncertainties surrounding Federal Reserve interest rate policy may lead to short-term fluctuations, the downside risks to gold prices are expected to be limited. Strong central bank purchases, particularly from China and India, have offset outflows from gold exchange-traded funds, driven partly by geopolitical tensions such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the COVID pandemic. The recent decrease in ETF purchases is attributed to already high holdings and the influence of real interest rates. Speculative positioning by hedge funds seems more responsive to shifts in long-term yields than ETF holdings. Historically, changes in gold ETF holdings have correlated with major risk-off events and cycles of monetary policy easing. Analysts anticipate a potential increase in ETF holdings once the Fed begins cutting rates, possibly starting in May. Additionally, rising incomes in emerging markets are boosting consumer demand for gold, particularly in jewelry. According to Goldman Sachs analysts:\n\u201cThe rapidly growing cohort of \u2018affluent\u2019 consumers in India \u2026 will drive growth in jewelry consumption. Moreover, gold consumption has also been supported by a lack of alternative investments in some countries which saw big policy shifts (Turkey, China) in the past few years.\u201d\nGold and silver are expected to see continued growth in 2024, as UBSforecasts, largely due to anticipated interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve. This expectation, coupled with a weaker dollar, is projected to push gold prices upwards, with forecasts suggesting a potential increase to $2,200 per ounce by year-end. Historically, gold tends to rise when interest rates decrease, as it becomes a more attractive investment compared to bonds in a low-rate environment. Additionally, lower interest rates typically lead to a depreciation of the dollar, making gold more affordable for international buyers, thereby boosting demand. Despite uncertainties surrounding the timing and extent of rate cuts, UBS maintains its forecast for Federal Reserve policy easing. The recent surge in gold's appeal as a safe haven asset, particularly amidst geopolitical tensions like Israel's conflict with Hamas, has also contributed to its record-breaking prices. Moreover, optimism extends to silver, often considered gold's \"poorer cousin,\" which is expected to perform well, especially in the event of Federal Reserve easing. While silver has historically underperformed gold, analysts believe it has significant catching up to do, potentially resulting in a dramatic surge.\nSome of the best gold stocks to buy include Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD), and Franco-Nevada Corporation (NYSE:FNV).

The investment firm said a confluence of factors might support small-caps in sustaining market leadership. The still-growing US economy, together with a more typical interest rate environment, might support small-cap leadership.\nInvestment Themes in the US\nAs per Russell Investments, the US equity-market leadership reversed during Q3 2024, with small-cap stocks surpassing the returns delivered by their large-cap counterparts. Also, the value factor outperformed the growth factor. This means there was a significant pivot from the first 2 quarters of 2024, during which market returns were dominated by the US large-cap growth stocks\u2014 the Magnificent 7, to be precise.\nRussell Investments highlighted that, from Q2 2024 to Q3 2024, there was a moderate change in the US average daily turnover, with $578.8 billion in Q3 2024 as compared to $581.5 billion in Q2 2024. Q3 2024 saw a shift in investor focus from high-flying tech stocks to more traditional sectors. Small-cap and value stocks surpassed the performance of large-cap and growth stocks, thanks to the broader market rotation. Moreover, utility stocks saw significant traction due to higher investments in energy infrastructure in a bid to support the elevated demand from AI and data centers.\nWall Street experts believe that the shifts in monetary policy, sectoral innovation and developments, a favorable interest rate environment, and supportive regulatory environment are expected to fuel growth in small and emerging stocks over the next year.\nAs per Francis Gannon, Co-Chief Investment Officer, and Managing Director of Royce Investment Partners, earnings form the foundation for long-term performance. This means that earnings tend to support the broader market over the long term. He noted that the Russell 2000 saw a near-record number of companies having no earnings, with a total of ~44.6% (as of September end). Despite this, the earnings growth for the small-cap companies that have them has been estimated to be higher than large-cap ones in 2025.\nChuck Royce, Founder and Senior Advisor at Royce Investment Partners, believes that the lower rates are expected to help the M&A activity. The potential buyers have been waiting for the US Fed to act before they go ahead with acquisitions. He believes that many small-caps want to get merged. Therefore, there are expectations of more strategic buyouts moving forward.\nOur Methodology\nTo list the 10 Best Fundamentally Strong Penny Stocks to Invest In, we used Finviz and Yahoo screeners to extract stocks trading under $5. Next, we selected the companies that have reliable 3-year revenue and 3-year net income growth rates. Finally, the stocks were arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holdings, as of Q2 2024.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\nA business professional banking from their laptop, taking advantage of the company's investment services.\nLuk Fook Holdings (International) Limited (OTC:LKFLF) is an investment holding company, which is engaged in sourcing, designing, wholesaling, trademark licensing, and retailing various gold and platinum jewellery, and gem-set jewellery products.\nWall Street analysts believe that Luk Fook Holdings (International) Limited (OTC:LKFLF)\u2019s growth prospects are expected to be aided by its asset-light model, which should enable the company to expand into lower-tier cities in China. The firm\u2019s focus on affordable luxury and its strong network of licensed stores provide a healthy foundation for future growth. The analysts are optimistic about Luk Fook Holdings (International) Limited (OTC:LKFLF) as a result of its strong licensing model and healthy post-pandemic recovery.\nThe company\u2019s strategy revolves around the successful use of licensing, which led to the expansion of its brand reach across Mainland China and fortified Luk Fook Holdings (International) Limited (OTC:LKFLF)\u2019s position in Hong Kong/Macau and several other international markets. The company continues to focus on cost efficiency and store optimization and remains well-placed to manage potential rental cost hikes.\nLuk Fook Holdings (International) Limited (OTC:LKFLF)\u2019s successful reinvigoration of tourist sales and a lower gold hedging ratio should help it to capitalize on rising gold prices. The company highlighted that the decline in same-store sales in the Mainland market (which includes self-operated shops and licensed shops) and the Hong Kong market narrowed since September. From 1 October - 14 October 2024, its overall same-store sales performance demonstrated some improvements as compared to Q2.\nThe mainland government continues to work on boosting domestic demand. In hopes of improved macroeconomic conditions and recovery of retail sentiment, its retailing business should regain its growth momentum. Luk Fook Holdings (International) Limited (OTC:LKFLF) is optimistic about its mid-to-long-term business prospects and it will continue to expand in the Mainland market.\nAs per Wall Street analysts, the shares of the company have an average price target of $2.20.\nOverall LKFLF ranks 6th on our list of the best fundamentally strong penny stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of LKFLF as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than LKFLF but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.",

Commons\u2019 Transport Select Committee \u201cthere is a conversation to come\u201d about how the Government\u2019s decision to axe HS2 north of Birmingham will affect what trains are required.\nA joint venture between Alstom and Hitachi Rail was awarded contracts to design, build and maintain non-tilting trains by Government-owned company HS2 Ltd.\nThere are suggestions the curtailment of the

import tariffs being imposed from next year on many electric vehicles (EVs) traded with Britain.\nBritain and the European Union are each other\u2019s largest market for exports of EVs, which are being encouraged as an alternative to carbon-emitting internal combustion engine vehicles powered by petrol or diesel.\nThe European Commission also said it was setting aside an extra \u20ac3bn (\u00a32.6bn) to boost the bloc\u2019s battery manufacturing industry, a move designed to increase local content and reduce its reliance on China.\nThe post-Brexit Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) says that, to qualify for zero tariffs, at least 55pc of the value of EVs needs to be from the European Union or Britain, with values of 65pc for battery cells and modules and 70pc for battery packs.\nHowever, it contains two transition periods, the first with EVs requiring 40pc local content and battery packs and components 30pc, the second for 2024-2026 at 45pc for EVs, 50pc for battery cells and modules and 60pc for battery packs.\nImport tariffs of 10pc apply for EVs falling short of those requirements.\nThe Commission\u2019s proposal is to extend the first transition period for three years to 2027, when the full local content requirements of the TCA will apply.\n01:57 PM GMT\nPrivate sector hiring slows in US\nHiring in the US private sector cooled in November, as the

remained remarkably resilient, although it has shown some signs of cooling in recent months.\nAgainst this backdrop, there is widespread agreement among analysts and traders that the Fed will vote to hold rates steady at its interest rate decision next week, as it continues its fight against elevated inflation.\nThe US private sector added 103,000 jobs in November, according to the latest ADP report.\nThis was lower than the 113,000 jobs created in October, and was sharply below the expectation of 127,000 new jobs predicted by Briefing.com.\n01:46 PM GMT\nSavings market becoming more

increased by \u00a317bn.\nOver the same period, deposits held in bank and building society non-interest-bearing accounts and easy-access accounts reduced by \u00a311bn.\nThe average rate paid on easy-access deposits in October was 1.99pc, the FCA said, up from 1.66pc in July.\nThe average rate for fixed-term (which guarantee a rate for a specified period with restricted withdrawals) and notice accounts (which have a specified notice period for restricted withdrawals with a guaranteed rate) was 2.94pc in July, rising to 3.52pc in October.\n01:13 PM GMT\nAirline adverts banned over

airlines\u2019 environmental impact.\nThe Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the ads had breached advertising rules, and \u201cmust not appear again in the form complained about\u201d.\nIn the Google ads that were all seen in July, Lufthansa said people would \u201cFly more sustainably\u201d with the airline. An Air France-KLM advert said it was \u201ccommitted to protecting the environment\u201d and helped people to \u201ctravel better and sustainably\u201d.\nEtihad Airways said consumers could explore the world with \u201cTotal Peace Of Mind,\u201d while mentioning their \u201cEnvironmental Advocacy\u201d.\nThe ASA investigated all three ads over concerns that they gave a misleading impression of the airlines\u2019 environmental impact.\nThe ASA said Etihad had removed the ad once it had been notified of the initial complaint.\nEtihad had no immediate comment on Wednesday. There was no immediate comment from Air France-KLM.\nLufthansa said its ad was created by the Google Ads service and was designed to highlight a \u201cGreen Fares\u201d option which allows passengers to offset some of their CO2 emissions.\n12:54 PM GMT\nCommuter chaos as Aslef 24-hour rail strikes hit\nSome of the busiest commuter rail routes in the country had limited services or no trains at all

Wight\u2019s Island Line walked out on Wednesday morning for 24 hours in the latest in a series of stoppages this week which are causing travel chaos.\nAslef says its members are determined to continue taking industrial action until they receive an improved pay offer on one made earlier this year of 8 per cent over two years.\nTrain operators and the Government are urging Aslef to put the offer to a ballot, but the union points out that its members have regularly voted to continue taking strike action.\nHere is everything you need to know about the walkouts.\n12:10 PM GMT\nPound hits

slumped.\nThe euro dipped as much as 0.2pc against the pound to 85.54p, its lowest since early September, before recovering a touch to trade down 0.1pc on the day.\nThe move comes as German factory orders unexpectedly shrank in October, while its construction sector has fallen into a \u201cperilous plunge\u201d according to private sector data.\nIt also comes as markets increasingly bet that the

But most of those gains have occurred since early October as the metal was trading sideways throughout most of 2023 until then.\nThe recent surge has been supercharged by increasing expectations among investors that the Federal Reserve is not only done with its interest rate hiking regime, but that it could cut interest rates as soon as the first quarter of 2024.\nThe CME Fed Watch Tool currently projects that the Fed will institute its first rate cut at its FOMC meeting in March with next year's cuts totaling 125 basis points.\nSome economists expect even more cuts. ING forecasts 150 basis points in 2024 and a further 100 basis points of rate cuts in 2025. If those predictions prove correct, gold prices might not be done rising.\nThat's because alternative like cash will be a lot less appealing to investors as interest rates start to fall. Gold prices also tend to rise when the Federal Reserve is in easing mode, whether it's cutting interest rates or increasing its balance sheet, on fears of potential inflation as well as the long-term effects that easing could have on the stability of the US dollar and economy.\nBut gold prices can rise without the need for economic gloom and doom, according to Carson Group's chief market strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\"We don't think gold at new highs is a major warning sign of impending doom, as there are many examples in history of both stocks and gold doing just fine, most recently 2003-2007. We wouldn't be surprised at all to see another period of both assets doing well,\" Detrick told Business Insider on Monday.\nFrom a technical-analysis perspective, gold prices could continue to rise if it can maintain its current breakout above $2,063 per ounce for another week, according to Fairlead Strategies' founder Katie Stockton.",

The Kon\u00e9 Project consists of the Kon\u00e9 gold deposit and the Gbongogo Main gold deposit and is located on the Kon\u00e9 \u2013 Fonondara shear zone which hosts the Seguela gold mine (owned by Fortuna Silver) to the south and the Fonondara, Cassere and Caribou advanced stage gold targets in the north (owned by Barrick Gold).\nIn January 2024, Montage released the results of an updated definitive feasibility study (the \"UFS\") for the Kon\u00e9 Project, outlining a 16-year gold project producing 3.57M ounces of gold at AISC of $998 per ounce over the life of mine, with average annual production of 223koz, as highlighted in Table 1 below.\nTable 1: Summary Life-of-Mine Metrics\nUnits | Metric | |\nPit Optimization Gold Price | $/oz | $1,550 |\nFinancial Model Base Case Gold Price | $/oz | $1,850 |\nLife of Mine | years | 16.0 |\nTotal Material Processed | Mt | 174.3 |\nContained Gold (Probable Reserves) | Moz | 4.01 |\nStrip Ratio | w:o | 1.18:1 |\nMill Throughput | Mtpa | 11.0 |\nAverage Head Grade, first 3 years | Au g/t | 1.15 |\nAverage Head Grade, LOM | Au g/t | 0.72 |\nProcessing Recovery, first 3 Years | % | 89.6 % |\nProcessing Recovery, LOM | % | 89.0 % |\nTotal Gold Production, LOM | Moz | 3.57 |\nAverage Gold Production, first 3 years | koz/yr | 349 |\nAverage Gold Production, first 8 years | koz/yr | 301 |\nAverage Gold Production, LOM | koz/yr | 223 |\nMining Cost Per Tonne Mined, LOM | $/t, mined | $3.22 |\nMining Cost Per Tonne Processed, LOM | $/t, processed | $6.68 |\nProcessing Cost, LOM (incl. rehandle) | $/t, processed | $8.94 |\nG&A, LOM | $/t, processed | $0.98 |\nRoyalties, LOM | $/t, processed | $2.84 |\nTotal Operating Costs, LOM | $/t, processed | $19.83 |\nAverage AISC, first 3 years | $/oz | $899 |\nAverage AISC, LOM | $/oz | $998 |\nInitial Capital Expenditure | $M | $712 |\nTotal LOM Capital (incl.

The next step in the permitting process is the formal validation hearing to approve the ESIA.\nThe Ministry of Mines and Petroleum recently reiterated their support for the advancement of the Kon\u00e9 Gold Project, and in anticipation of a successful validation hearing to approve the ESIA, has instructed Montage to submit the Mining Permit Application for the project ahead of the ESIA validation to accelerate the permitting process. As such, the Mining Permit Application is expected to be filed in the coming weeks.\nFinancing Activities\nDiscussions regarding project financing continue to progress and the Company is encouraged at initial indications of size, structure, and pricing of various alternatives.\nExploration Underway to Define Next Satellite Deposits\nAs shown in Figure 2 below, numerous targets were identified in proximity to the Kon\u00e9 deposit. The key priority area is the Diouma-Gbongogo-Korotou shear zone which is a 15km strike length of soil anomalism where nine targets have been drill tested to some degree. The Gbongogo Main pit and planned haul road are located at the south end of this zone.\nThe Diouma North prospect is located 2km south of the Gbongogo Main pit, and less than 500m from the planned haul road. As follow-up to reconnaissance and RC drilling in early 2023, Montage completed three diamond core holes, with highlight intercepts including: 14m at 2.16g/t from 58m (GBDDH062); and 17.45m at 2.74g/t from 79m and 11m at 2.21g/t from 127m (GBDDH064). Diamond drilling at Diouma re-commenced in January with an initial core programme which, if successful, will be followed up with an RC programme.\nIn addition, over the course of 2024, Montage will be conducting exploration at the Petit Yao target which sits 7km east of Kon\u00e9 and just 3km southeast of the planned haul road.\nABOUT MONTAGE GOLD CORP.\nMontage is a Canadian-based precious metals exploration and development company focused on opportunities in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. The Company's flagship property is the Kon\u00e9 Gold Project, located in northwest C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, which currently hosts a Probable Mineral Reserve of 174.3 Mt grading 0.72g/t for 4.01M ounces of gold. The Company released the results of an updated feasibility study on the Kon\u00e9 Gold Project on January 16, 2024, outlining a 16-year gold project producing 3.57M ounces of gold at AISC of $998 per ounce over the life of mine, with average annual production of 223koz, and peak annual production of 378koz. Montage has a management team and Board with significant experience in discovering and developing gold deposits in Africa.\nTECHNICAL DISCLOSURE\nThe Kon\u00e9 and Gbongogo Main Mineral Resource Estimates were carried out by Mr. Jonathon Abbott of Matrix Resource Consultants of Perth, Western Australia, who is considered to be independent of Montage Gold.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, constitute Forward-looking Statements. Words such as \"will\", \"intends\", \"proposed\" and \"expects\" or similar expressions are intended to identify Forward-looking Statements. Forward looking Statements in this press release include statements related to the Company's mineral reserve and resource estimates; the timing and amount of future production from the Kon\u00e9 Gold Project; expectations with respect to the IRR, NPV, payback and costs of the Kon\u00e9 Gold Project; anticipated mining and processing methods of the Kon\u00e9 Gold Project; anticipated mine life of the Kon\u00e9 Gold Project; expected recoveries and grades of the Kon\u00e9 Gold Project; and timing for permits and concessions, including that the Company will receive all approvals in H2-2024 necessary to build the project and that the Mining Permit Application is expected to be filed in the coming weeks, and exploration plans for 2024. Forward-looking Statements involve various risks and uncertainties and are based on certain factors and assumptions.

Any Forward-looking Statements contained in this press release are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\nThis press release includes certain terms or performance measures commonly used in the mining industry that are not defined under International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\"), including cash costs and AISC (or \"all-in sustaining costs\") per payable ounce of gold sold and per tonne processed and mining, processing and operating costs reported on a unit basis. Non-GAAP measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS and, therefore, they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies. The Company discloses \"cash costs\" and \"all-in sustaining costs\" and other unit costs because it understands that certain investors use this information to determine the Company's ability to generate earnings and cash flows for use in investing and other activities. The Company believes that conventional measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS, do not fully illustrate the ability of mines to generate cash flows. The measures, as determined under IFRS, are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flows from operating activities. The measures cash costs and all-in sustaining costs and unit costs are considered to be key indicators of a project's ability to generate operating earnings and cash flows. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS and are not necessarily indicative of operating costs, operating profit or cash flows presented under IFRS. Readers should also refer to our management's discussion and analysis, available under our corporate profile at www.sedarplus.ca for a more detailed discussion of how we calculate such measures.\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/montage-gold-expands-leadership-team-and-announces-c20-million-non-brokered-financing-backed-by-lundin-trusts-302069397.html\nSOURCE Montage Gold Corp",

Almost 100 bps of cuts are priced in for this year, and another 100 bps next year.\nU.S. Treasury yields drifted lower. The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes fell 2.3 basis points to 3.795%, from 3.818% late on Tuesday. The 2-year yield, which typically moves in step with interest-rate expectations, fell 6.9 bp to 3.9305%, from 4% late on Tuesday.\nA potentially unique situation beckons with material rate cuts without a recession, unlike the backdrop for cutting borrowing costs in five of the past seven cutting cycles, said Ross Yarrow, U.S. equities managing director at investment bank Baird.",

Here's how\nCardone says his cash earns between 3.5% and 5.5% on average, but the net return is far lower. \u201cI don\u2019t want 5% on my money,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's all taxed at my rate [it] is taxed half, so I earned 2.7%. And I didn't keep up with inflation. I didn't keep up with the hammering. [I\u2019m] actually losing money by keeping it there.\u201d\nAverage annual inflation rate for the United States was 3% for the 12 months ending in June, so Cardone\u2019s cash hoard has certainly lost purchasing power after taxes. He\u2019s not the only one getting \u201chammered.\u201d Warren Buffett reportedly has $189 billion in cash that\u2019s also subject to the same inflation rate.\n\u201cThe arithmetic makes it plain that inflation is a far more devastating tax than anything that has been enacted by our legislatures,\u201d Buffett once said. Here\u2019s how savvy investors avoid this invisible tax on their fortune.\nReal estate\nCardone\u2019s preferred asset class has a reputation for being a hedge against inflation. Housing and real estate are key components of the cost of living, so when rent, home prices and mortgage rates rise so too does the inflation rate. In other words, real estate retains its value during periods of high inflation.\nAnalysis by Avison Young found a correlation between real estate\u2019s total return and inflation, with the correlation rising when property was held for longer durations.\nWith this in mind, you could add some exposure to real estate to mitigate the impact of inflation on your portfolio.\nRead more: Car insurance rates have spiked in the US to a stunning $2,150/year \u2014 but you can be smarter than that.

This PEA is an important step forward as it converts our successful exploration programs into a baseline production scenario that shows potential for robust economic development for Omai to once again become a large-scale gold producer, supported by the many benefits of a brownfields project including good road access, a nearby skilled workforce and the strong support of government for re-development.\"\n\"Although we have not included the adjacent Gilt Creek Deposit in this PEA economics, we are confident that it will contribute to an overall future mine plan. Since Gilt Creek would be an underground mine, it would have required significant additional engineering, time and cost, and our priority was to establish a baseline valuation for our shareholders. We have fast-tracked the advancement of this project over the past two years and are pleased to deliver these tangible results.\"\nPEA Highlights for Wenot Open Pit\n-\nAfter-tax NPV5% of $556 million and after-tax IRR of 19.8% based on $1,950/oz gold with a sensitivity case at $2,200/oz gold giving an after-tax NPV5% of $777 million and IRR of 24.7%\n-\nInitial capital (\"Capex\") of $375 million and sustaining capital of $172 million over life-of-mine\n-\nProjected average gold production of 142,000 oz per year over a 13-year mine life\n-\nAfter-tax payback of 4.3 years at base case $1,950/oz gold (3.5 years at $2,200/oz gold)\n-\nAverage cash operating costs of $916/oz gold and all-in sustaining costs of $1,009/oz\n-\nCumulative cash flow of $1.07 billion after-tax over 13 years on base case assumptions\n-\nTotal payable gold production of 1.84 million ounces\n-\nAverage head grade of 1.51 g/t Au and 92.5% process recovery\n-\nAverage strip ratio for the open pit life-of-mine estimated at 7.8:1\nClick here to view a 3D model of the Wenot Open Pit Deposit\nOmai's CEO continued, \"We are pleased with the PEA results as it establishes the potential for a single \"superpit\" for the Wenot deposit. We further believe that Omai holds exceptional potential to both expand the mine plan and to boost the economics: 1) At Wenot, there are gold zones identified along strike and at depth that can be expected to expand Mineral Resources within and outside the designed PEA pit; 2) By completing engineering studies and incorporating the adjacent Gilt Creek Deposit, the Omai mine plan could potentially expand to a 20+ year mine life; and 3) By advancing work on two high-grade near-surface zones, there is potential for higher grade process plant feed for the first few years that would boost economics considerably. The PEA sets the stage for Omai to advance engineering and permitting initiatives towards a Preliminary Feasibility Study (\"PFS\"). With these goals in mind, we are anxious to continue our work advancing the Omai Project in 2024.\"\nFinancial and operating metrics from the PEA are presented in Table 1 below.\nNote: The PEA is preliminary in nature and includes Inferred Mineral Resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA will be realized. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.\nTable 1.

For example, at the base case gold price of US$1,950/oz, the Wenot Project generates after-tax NPV of $556.4 million using a 5% discount rate with an after-tax IRR of 19.8%. However, a 10% sensitivity increase to the base case gold price to $2,145/oz, results in an after-tax NPV of $728.2 million and an after-tax IRR of 23.7% with a payback period of 3.6 years from the commencement of production.\nTable 2.

Wenot Production Profile\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8712/204278_omai2en.jpg\nCapital Costs\nThe initial capital costs are estimated at $375.2 million, with life-of-mine sustaining costs estimated at $172 million. Contingencies of $54 million and $18 million are included in initial and sustaining capital costs, respectively. These estimates were based on current costs and quotes received from potential local vendors with other estimates based on references and experience from similar operations.\nThe main components of the $375.2 million initial capital costs include: $100 million for the processing plant equipment and buildings plus $75 million indirect costs to construct the process plant, $46 million for mining equipment and surface preparation, $45 million for surface civil and infrastructure, $33 million for capitalized pre-stripping, $20 million for owner's costs, and $54 million contingency.\nThe main components of the $172 million sustaining capital include: $139 million for mining equipment, $9 million for tailings and water treatment, $6 million for process plant equipment, and $18 million contingency.\nCash Costs\nTotal cash cost including royalties is estimated at $41.00 per tonne processed or $916/oz of payable gold. The all-in-sustaining cost is estimated at $1,009/oz of payable gold. Operating cost estimates were developed using vendor quotes and knowledge of similar operations with productivities being derived from benchmarking and industry practices.\nTable 3.

Management believes that the Gilt Creek Deposit, which would require underground mining, is sufficiently attractive to be integrated into a larger mine plan, however, to accelerate and simplify this current PEA, it was excluded.\nOn February 8, 2024, the Company announced an updated Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") for the Omai Property in Guyana (Wenot and Gilt Creek Deposits). It details a total Indicated MRE of 1.985 million ounces of gold averaging 2.15 g/t Au and an Inferred MRE of 2.279 million ounces averaging 2.26 g/t Au.\nThe PEA is based on the Wenot Deposit, with an Indicated MRE of 834,000 ounces averaging 1.48 g/t Au and an Inferred MRE of 1,614,000 ounces averaging 1.99 g/t Au. The pit design used in the PEA does not include 58,600 oz of Indicated Mineral Resources and 456,900 oz of Inferred Mineral Resources, which represents approximately 21% of the total Wenot MRE ounces (Figure 5). These excluded MRE ounces are either hosted within multiple, narrow veins or are isolated zones at depth that result in a high strip ratio. However, it is expected that at least a portion of this currently excluded Mineral Resource could be incorporated in future economic scenarios upon further drilling.\nFigure 3. 3-D Model of Wenot and Gilt Creek Deposits, Omai Gold Property, Guyana\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8712/204278_ee82559cb432ea82_003full.jpg\nThe Mineral Resource Estimates for Omai are presented in Table 4. Notes accompanying the 2024 MRE are shown below the table, summarizing the economic and technical assumptions.\nTable 4. 2024 (January) Mineral Resource Estimates\n| | Indicated Resources | Inferred Resources | ||||||\n| Resource Area | Mining Method | Tonnes | Au | Au | Tonnes | Au | Au | |\n| GILT CREEK (1.5 g/t Cut-Off) | Underground | 11,123 | 3.22 | 1,151 | 6,186 | 3.35 | 665 | |\n| WENOT (0.35 g/t Cut-Off) | Open Pit | 17,572 | 1.48 | 834 | 25,183 | 1.99 | 1,614 | |\n| Total Mineral Resource Estimate | 28,695 | 2.15 | 1,985 | 31,369 | 2.26 | 2,279 | ||\n| Wenot Mineral Resource Estimate by Deposit Type | ||||||||\n| WENOT | Saprolite & Alluvium | Open Pit | 2,048 | 1.07 | 70 | 153 | 1.13 | 5 |\n| Fresh Rock & Transition | Open Pit | 15,524 | 1.53 | 764 | 25,030 | 2.00 | 1,609 |\nNotes to Accompany the 2024 Mineral Resource Estimate:\n1. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.\n2. The estimate of Mineral Resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-political, marketing, or other relevant issues.\n3. The Inferred Mineral Resource in this estimate has a lower level of confidence than that applied to an Indicated Mineral Resource and must not be converted to a Mineral Reserve. It is reasonably expected that the majority of the Inferred Mineral Resource could potentially be upgraded to an Indicated Mineral Resource with continued exploration.\n4. The Mineral Resources were estimated in accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM), CIM Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, Definitions (2014) and Best Practices Guidelines (2019) prepared by the CIM Standing Committee on Reserve Definitions and adopted by the CIM Council.\n5. Wenot wireframe constrained gold assays were composited to 1.5 metre lengths and subsequently capped between 10 to 25 g/t. Gilt Creek Wireframe constrained gold assays were composited to 1.0 metre lengths and subsequently capped between 12 to 40 g/t.\n6. The Wenot Mineral Resource Estimate incorporates 9,840 assay results from 603 diamond drill holes totalling 87,323 m within the mineralized wireframes.\nThe Gilt Creek Mineral Resource Estimate incorporates 7,056 assay results from 46 diamond drill holes totalling 27,997 m within the mineralized wireframes\n7. Grade estimation was undertaken with ID3interpolation.\n8. Wenot wireframe constrained bulk density was determined from 30 site visit samples.\nGilt wireframe constrained bulk density was determined from 28 site visit samples.\n9. Wenot gold process recoveries used were 92% for Alluvium/Saprolite and 92% for Transition/Fresh Rock.\nGilt Creek gold process recovery used was 92%\n10. The gold price used was US$1,850/oz\n11. Wenot US$ open pit operating costs used were $2.50/t for mineralized material mining, $1.75/t for waste mining, $10/t for Alluvium/Saprolite processing, $14/t for Transition/Fresh Rock processing and $2.50/t G&A. Gilt Creek US$ underground operating costs used were $60/t for mining, $15/t for processing and $7/t G&A.\n12. At Gilt Creek, MRE blocks were reviewed for grade and geometric continuity. Isolated/orphaned and single block width strings of blocks were removed in order to only report Mineral Resources with a reasonable prospect of economic extraction.\n13. Wenot pit slopes were 45o.\nMining\nThe Project area consists of subdued topography. The area, topography, and climate are amenable to the conventional open pit mining operations proposed for the Project, similar to historical operations. No underground mining is planned at this stage although the potential for development of underground mining of the Gilt Creek Deposit will be evaluated in the future.\nThe Wenot mining operations will encompass a single large open pit with 55o hard rock inter ramp slopes and 30o saprolite slopes that will be mined with conventional mining equipment in two pushback phases. In order to improve mining selectivity and reduce dilution, two different bench heights and sets of mining equipment will be used. Mineralization will be mined using a 5 m high bench height with 150 mm diameter blast hole drills, and a fleet consisting of 5 m3 bucket excavators and 35 t rigid body haul trucks. Waste rock and saprolite will be mined on 10 m high benches using 200 mm diameter blast hole drills, 22 m3 bucket hydraulic excavators, and 177 t haul trucks. Major pieces of mining equipment will be purchased via a lease financing agreement. Various support equipment will be required, such as dozers, graders, water trucks, and light vehicles for maintenance, personnel transport and mine supervision. The surficial saprolite cover, which is anticipated to be free digging and will not require blasting, is up to 60m thick forming the upper part of the 440 m deep open pit.\nThe open pit mine will have a mineralization production rate that averages 9,000 tpd over a 13-year mine life. A total of 322.3 Mt of waste rock is planned to be mined, with 2.6 Mt of mineralization in saprolite and 38.5 Mt of mineralization in fresh rock, for a total strip ratio of 7.8:1, at an average grade of 1.51 g/t Au containing 1.99 Moz Au. Total material mined will peak at 110,000 tpd.\nMineralization may be delivered either to the primary crusher or placed into a nearby stockpile. Waste rock is either taken to a waste storage facility or used in tailings dam embankment construction.\nFigure 4. Wenot Open Pit Design (Two Phases)\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/8712/204278_ee82559cb432ea82_004full.jpg\nMetallurgy & Processing\nAn average of 9,000 tpd of gold mineralized material will be treated in the Omai process plant. The process plant will consist of a semi-autogenous grinding mill in closed circuit with a pebble crusher and ball mill in a closed circuit with cyclones (SABC circuit). Primary crushing will consist of a gyratory crusher for hard run-of-mine (\"ROM\") feed. A gravity circuit, which precedes leaching will recover coarse gold from the cyclone underflow, while the cyclone overflow is thickened and treated in a multi-tank carbon-in-leach (\"CIL\") or carbon-in-pulp (\"CIP\") circuit. Gold will be stripped from the loaded carbon, concentrated by electrowinning and recovered as gold bars in a gold room.\nThe Omai Gold process plant will be designed to be a compact facility with attached grinding media and reagent reception. The process plant facilities will include a laboratory, a mill maintenance workshop, and safety, personal services and management offices.\nMetallurgical Data\nThe anticipated metallurgical performance for processing the Omai Mineral Resources has a dual base of verification: (i) A comprehensive test program by Lakefield Research (now SGS Canada) that was completed in 1990 on drill core representing seven mineralized zones, and (ii) The processing of 80 million tonnes of mineralized material over 12 years by Omai Gold Mines Limited (OGML) from the Fennel and Wenot pits as well as alluvial zones.\nDuring operations from 1993 to 2005, the hard rock ROM feed was crushed in a gyratory crusher and ground by a combination of SAG and ball mills (a SABC designation). Soft mineralized material was blended by a backhoe into the crushed hard rock feed. A combination of gravity-based methods including spiral, Nelson centrifuge and tabling was employed to recover free gold. Gold leaching was conventional with a mild concentration of process reagents, air-sparged leaching followed by CIP gold recovery, stripping from the carbon, electrowinning and electric furnace refining. The historical gold recovery ranged from 92% to 94%.\nMetallurgical testing at Lakefield included grinding tests indicating that the Bond Work Index was very high for the hard-rock composites at 19 to 25 KWh/t. As anticipated, the Work Index was very low (~6 KWh/t) for saprolite. Gravity concentration was examined for diorite and saprolite composites and a substantial proportion of gold (~30%) was recovered. A series of standard, 48-hour leach tests were performed on each composite, with the effect of pre-grinding of the samples to up to 90% passing -200 mesh. The results indicated a high gold extraction, from 92% to 97% on the hard rock samples, with only a small effect due to grind size.\nCarbon-in-pulp (CIP) testing, representing the recovery of the extracted gold liberated as a process reagent-complex in leaching, was also tested. The recovery of gold to carbon was high for all composites. Flocculation and thickening tests indicated that reasonable performance could be anticipated in pre-leach thickening which is a key parameter when processing soft, saprolitic feeds.\nWhile the processing history can be used as a new Omai process design basis, test-based options for process upgrading will be considered for crushing-grinding, gravity concentration, gold leaching and recovery (CIL vs. CIP). Since crushing-grinding is the most energy intensive stage, lower energy intensity options including a second stage crushing and high pressure grinding rolls (HPGR's) will be considered to address both cost and sustainability factors.\nAccess & Infrastructure\nThe Omai Project is located approximately 165 km south of Guyana's capital city of Georgetown and is accessible via a major road that connects Georgetown to Brazil, roughly 350 km south of the Project. This road is paved for the first 90 km to the town of Linden (population ~45,000). Linden is the second largest city in Guyana and was established for bauxite mining. When Omai was in production roughly 90% of the workforce lived in Linden, and it is expected to again be a source from much of the Omai workforce. The road from Linden is currently being widened and paved. It is expected that by year end 2024, there will be a paved road from Georgetown, via Linden, to within 8 km of the Omai Project. The Omai Mine road extends to the east bank of the Essequibo River where a public ferry takes passengers and vehicles across the river on a regular basis.\nThe Omai site is mostly cleared of forest and has an extensive network of dirt roads providing access to most areas of the Property. The site includes a number of large warehouses remaining from the mining days. The Omai camp consists of two large warehouses that have been repurposed as offices, accommodations, drill core logging facilities and drill core storage, and workshop. Two bunkies provide additional housing, with the camp currently having accommodations for 60 workers.\nThe mining and processing infrastructure will be located at the Omai site. The Project will require construction of the following infrastructure: 9,000 tpd process plant, offices, truck shop and warehouse, new camp accommodation, surface water management facility, service and haulage roads and initial tailings management facility. An existing airstrip will be used for emergencies and time sensitive transport.\nTailings and Water Management\nThe tailings storage plan will take advantage of existing facilities and features on the Omai Property, including the existing 350-acre tailings facility and the dewatered Fennel mined-out open pit. Tailings decant will be recycled to the process plant with the excess water treated for discharge. Based on historical (OGML) evidence, the natural degradation of residual process reagents will facilitate the meeting of strict discharge criteria, and only treatment for suspended solids removal will be required.\nWorkforce\nDuring the construction of the mine, the workforce is estimated to consist of approximately 250 people for an 18-month period, this is in addition to employees who would be required for open pit pre-stripping operations in the 12 months leading up to the production phase of the mine life. During production from the Wenot open pit, the average number of employees at the mine and process plant is estimated at 439 people. The schedule will be two 12-hour shifts per day for 7 days a week.\nNext Steps\nThe positive results of the PEA warrant advancing the Project to the next study stages. Work programs, recommended to advance the Project to Pre-Feasibility Study level, include:\n-\nInfill drilling of gaps in projected gold zones that could potentially reduce waste rock and increase mineralized material within the Wenot designed pit, focusing on the southern side of the Deposit.\n-\nDrilling to convert Inferred Mineral Resources to Indicated.\n-\nDrilling near-surface areas to improve the process plant feed grade in the first two years of mine life.\n-\nConduct metallurgical studies including crushing-grinding, gravity, leaching and gold recovery tests on bulk samples. Process selection will depend on efficiency of gold recovery and minimizing electricity demand.\n-\nEvaluate gold leaching and recovery variability by Mineral Resource type and identify process options that result in lower energy consumption.\n-\nDetailed geochemical characterization of waste and mineralized rock.\n-\nDetailed geotechnical investigation in the Wenot pit and at various infrastructure sites.\n-\nDevelop a water management plan\n-\nStudies of tailings management facility development and/or refurbishment.\nQualified Persons\nThe PEA and Mineral Resource Estimate were completed in accordance with the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (\"CIM\") Definition Standards incorporated by reference in National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\") (2014) and CIM Estimation Best Practice Guidelines (2019).\nThe PEA and Mineral Resource Estimate, including verification of the data disclosed, was under the supervision of Eugene Puritch, P.Eng., FEC, CET, President of P&E Mining Consultants Inc., who is a Qualified Person (QP) and is independent of Omai Gold for the purposes of NI 43-101, and has reviewed and approved the technical contents of this new release.

The Company announced an updated NI 43-101 Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\") February 8, 2024 that includes 2.0 million ounces of gold (Indicated) and 2.3 million ounces (Inferred)1. Once South America's largest producing gold mine, Omai produced over 3.7 million ounces of gold between 1993 and 2005. Mining ceased at a time when the average gold price was less than US$400 per ounce. As a brownfields project, Omai benefits from good road access and a wealth of historical data that provides knowledge of the geology and gold mineralization on the Property, as well as metallurgy, historical process recoveries and many other relevant mining parameters. The Company's first economic study, a Preliminary Economic Assessment (\"PEA\") is presented in this news release above.\nFor further information, please see our website www.omaigoldmines.com or contact:\nElaine Ellingham, P.Geo.\nPresident & CEO\nelaine@omaigoldmines.com\nPhone: +1-416-473-5351\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements or information (collectively, \"FLI\") within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation.

Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on the FLI or information contained herein.\nAssumptions upon which FLI is based, without limitation, include the results of exploration activities, the Company's financial position and general economic conditions; the ability of exploration activities to accurately predict mineralization; the accuracy of geological modelling; the ability of the Company to complete further exploration activities; potential changes in project parameters or economic assessments; the legitimacy of title and property interests in the Project; the accuracy of key assumptions, parameters or methods used to estimate the MREs and in the PEA; the ability of the Company to obtain required approvals; geological, mining and exploration technical problems; failure of equipment or processes to operate as anticipated; the evolution of the global economic climate; metal prices; foreign exchange rates; environmental expectations; community and non-governmental actions; any impacts of COVID-19 on the Project; and, the Company's ability to secure required funding. Risks and uncertainties about Omai Gold's business are more fully discussed in the disclosure materials filed with the securities regulatory authorities in Canada, which are available at www.sedarplus.ca. Furthermore, should one or more of the risks, uncertainties or other factors materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those described in FLI.\nNon-IFRS Financial Measures\nOmai Gold has included certain non-IFRS financial measures in this press release, such as initial capital expenditures, sustaining capital expenditures, total cash costs and all in sustaining costs, which are not measures recognized under IFRS and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS. As a result, these measures may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. Each of these measures used are intended to provide additional information to the user and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. Non-IFRS financial measures used in this press release and common to the gold mining industry are defined below.\nTotal Cash Costs and Total Cash Costs per Ounce\nTotal cash costs are reflective of the cost of production. Total cash costs reported in the PEA include mining costs, processing, general and administrative costs of the mine, off-site costs, refining costs, transportation costs and royalties. Total cash costs per ounce is calculated as total cash costs divided by payable gold ounces.\nAll-In Sustaining Costs and All-In Sustaining Costs per Ounce\nAll-in sustaining costs and all-in sustaining costs per ounce are reflective of all of the expenditures that are required to produce an ounce of gold from operations. All-in sustaining costs reported in the PEA include total cash costs, sustaining capital, closure costs, but exclude corporate general and administrative costs. All-in sustaining costs per ounce is calculated as all-in sustaining costs divided by payable gold ounces.\nA description of the significant cost components that make up the forward looking non-IFRS financial measures of total cash costs and all in sustaining costs per ounce of payable gold produced is shown in the table below.\nCautionary Note to United States Investors\nOmai Gold prepares its disclosure in accordance with the requirements of securities laws in effect in Canada, which differ from the requirements of U.S. securities laws. Terms relating to mineral resources in this press release are defined in accordance with NI 43-101 under the guidelines set out in CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum Council on May 19, 2014, as amended (\"CIM Standards\"). The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") has adopted amendments effective February 25, 2019 (the \"SEC Modernization Rules\") to its disclosure rules to modernize the mineral property disclosure requirements for issuers whose securities are registered with the SEC under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a result of the adoption of the SEC Modernization Rules, the SEC will now recognize estimates of \"Measured Mineral Resources\", \"Iindicated Mineral Resources\" and \"Inferred Mineral Resources\", which are defined in substantially similar terms to the corresponding CIM Standards. In addition, the SEC has amended its definitions of \"Proven Mineral Reserves\" and \"Probable Mineral Reserves\" to be substantially similar to the corresponding CIM Standards.\nU.S. investors are cautioned that while the foregoing terms are \"substantially similar\" to corresponding definitions under the CIM Standards, there are differences in the definitions under the SEC Modernization Rules and the CIM Standards. Accordingly, there is no assurance any Mineral Resources that Omai Gold may report as \"Measured Mineral Resources\", \"Indicated Mineral Resources\" and \"Inferred Mineral Resources\" under NI 43-101 would be the same had Omai Gold prepared the Mineral Resource Estimates under the standards adopted under the SEC Modernization Rules. In accordance with Canadian securities laws, estimates of \"Inferred Mineral Resources\" cannot form the basis of feasibility or other economic studies, except in limited circumstances were permitted under NI 43-101.\nFigure 5.

However, despite a few recent dips, bitcoin is still near record highs with a current price of around $94,000 as of Feb. 24, 2025.\nIt\u2019s no wonder then that bitcoin bulls have been getting more bullish, including billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban. The longtime bitcoin enthusiast once said he would buy the asset \u201call day, every day\u201d over gold, and recently claimed it is a better version of gold in times of crisis or economic uncertainty.\nCuban added that his preference for bitcoin partly stems from its supply-and-demand dynamics. The crypto has a hard cap set at 21 million coins, with around 19.5 million currently in circulation. \u201cGold isn\u2019t based off the supply and demand of jewelry. People see it as an option in the event of the economy going down or something bad happening,\u201d he said.\nSo that\u2019s what Cuban thinks, but what about other experts in the field? Let\u2019s explore three different takes on Cuban\u2019s take on bitcoin.\nCuban Is Right\n\u201cOf course, I would buy bitcoin before buying gold,\u201d said Trevor Filter, co-founder of digital payments platform Flexa. He added that bitcoin has real utility behind its capacity as an investment, and it\u2019s perhaps the most promising asset today for digitizing value.\nSeveral other experts echoed the sentiment, such as Austin Alexander, co-founder of LayerTwo Labs, who argued that bitcoin is better than gold as it\u2019s more divisible and more transmissible, durable, scarce and portable.\n\u201cWith bitcoin, you can basically carry around $1 billion using what you\u2019ve memorized in terms of your seed phrase,\u201d he said. \u201cTo ship around large amounts of gold, you need basically an armada for protection, and that gets very, very expensive.\u201d\nOf course, the scarcity aspect Cuban mentioned is also agreed upon by experts who said there is a lot more upside to having from an investment perspective.\n\u201cThe more people that buy and the fewer people that sell that means the price is going to go up that\u2019s just the nature of it,\u201d Cuban said in the interview. \u201cIt\u2019s a great store of value that\u2019s why I have an investment in it, you know, because I do feel that the demand is going to exceed the number of people selling.\u201d\nAnd other experts argue that gold is an investment of the past, while bitcoin is \u201cGold 2.0.\u201d\nAccording to Evander Smart, founder of Bitcoin University and author of \u201cThe Book of Bitcoin,\u201d gold was the best retail investment of the 19th century, real estate was the best retail investment of the 20th century, while Bitcoin is the best retail investment of the 21st century.\n\u201cWhy? You can take it anywhere in the world, for free- there are no holding costs, no management fees, the appreciation is unlimited, and proven.,\u201d said Smart. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a brokerage account, or to be an institutional or accredited investor. You can keep it in your home without a thief taking it from you. It basically does everything Gold can never do. It is Gold 2.0, and the right investment to get started with, today.\u201d\nCuban\u2019s Partly Right\nLucas Kiely, chief investment officer of digital wealth platform Yield App, noted that some investors now consider bitcoin a better alternative to gold.\nFor instance, he said, it has seen much stronger price growth \u2014 44% per annum over the past decade over gold\u2019s 2%. It is often also considered a better hedge against inflation, earning it the title \u201cdigital gold.\u201d\n\u201cHowever, bitcoin is also significantly more volatile,\u201d he added. \u201cWhile gold has remained relatively stable since the 1980s, bitcoin\u2019s price soared nearly tenfold between January 2020 and the last halving in April 2021 and then plunged 53% the following month.\u201d\nIn turn, he argued that bitcoin and gold have advantages and disadvantages. The amount each investor allocates to each will depend on their goals, time frame and risk appetite.\n\u201cBitcoin is a high-risk investment and would fit in a different risk bracket in a balanced investment portfolio,\u201d he noted.\nBuying Both Bitcoin and Gold Is Right\nWhen a true economic crisis occurs, Cuban thinks bitcoin will have a slight advantage. He said, \u201cPeople look at bitcoin as a better version of gold, and I agree with that.\u201d\nHowever, some experts note that this is not an either-or decision. For instance, Joe Cavatoni, market strategist at the World Gold Council, said there is no demonstrated evidence of any switch trades taking place between gold and Bitcoin.\n\u201cWe\u2019re more focused on bitcoin\u2019s volatility and how it makes the case for a safe haven asset, like gold,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re adding risk to your portfolio by adding bitcoin, then an increased allocation of gold can help hedge that risk \u2014 it doesn\u2019t have to be one over the other, these assets are not competing against one another and the investment case is distinctly different.\u201d\nFinally, some experts said that Cuban is right in his assessment \u2014 in the current economic landscape of falling inflation.\n\u201cGold is a hard asset typically held as a hedge against inflation,\u201d said Thomas Hogan, Ph.D., senior research faculty, American Institute for Economic Research, and former chief economist for the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. \u201cThe price of gold rose during the pandemic recovery, but with inflation falling, it is not widely expected to appreciate significantly in coming years.\u201d\nCaitlyn Moorhead contributed to the reporting for this article.",

Bitcoin found a bottom in November 2022 and has made higher lows and highs throughout 2023 and into early 2024.\nWhile the trend remains bullish, the leading cryptocurrency reacted to the SEC\u2019s approval of spot bitcoin ETFs with \u201cbuy the rumor and sell the fact\u201d price action.\nQualified Spot Bitcoin Approval\nSEC Chairman Gary Gensler did not throw his whole-hearted support behind bitcoin when approving the spot ETFs.

Oxide recoveries averaged 87% recovery and unoxidized sulphide bearing samples averaged 89% recovery.\nResults are an essential milestone to advance the K1A target area as a potential bulk volume, low grade gold development project.\nCEO John McGloin commenting on the results said: \"The fire assay results reported for the Kalaka drilling in October verified and validated the very significant wide mineralised intersections recorded in the historical drilling at the K1A target. These new positive bottle roll test results are a further step towards demonstrating the potential positive economics of the property.\"\nKalaka Project\nAt the Kalaka Project, DFR and Panthera each have 40% interest, held through their shareholdings in Maniger Ltd. The remaining 20% interest is owned by a local partner, Golden Spear Mali SARL. Panthera is the operator of the project.\nThe project is located in southeast Mali, between Morila and Syama gold mines and is approximately 260 km southeast of Bamako. It lies approximately 80 km south of the Morila gold mine (8m oz) and 85 km northwest of Resolute's Syama gold mine (6m oz) and is situated adjacent and to the east of the regional Banifin Shear Zone.\nLeachwell Test work Results for Kalaka\nLeachwell analysis was completed on 23 samples from three of the RC drilled holes completed in 2023 at the K1A Prospect. As reported previously on 9 October 2023 significant mineralisation was intersected in the 2023 drilling campaign at the K1A prospect, including in KRC_23_007 with 12 m @ 1.62 g/t Au extending to the end of the hole 9 (from fire assay results). Results have now been received for all samples submitted to the SGS Laboratory located in Bamako, who for operational reasons sent the samples to their laboratory in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, for processing. The Leachwell analytical technique is a reagent grade catalyst formulated for fast cyanide (\"CN\") leach gold assaying. The technique provides a preliminary indication of the CN leachability of pre-metallurgical sample testing.\nThe test work indicated that CN extractable gold for the:\nnear surface oxide samples reported on average 87% recovery (samples from Drill hole KRC-23-005)\ntransitional zone samples reported on average 90% recovery (samples from Drill hole KRC-23-006); and\nunoxidized, sulphide-bearing samples reported on average 89% recovery (samples from Drill hole KRC-23-007).\nTable 1 below details the Leachwell (CN extractable gold) gold results and analysis.\nPanthera has also noted that when the one high grade 'outlier' pair sample is removed, the total Leachwell and Tails increases the average gold grade from 0.57g/t to 0.66g/t, a 16% increase versus the fire assays.\nFigure 1 below details the locations of the 2023 RC drill holes in relation to the K1A mineralisation and historical RC drill holes.\nThe very positive Leachwell test results provide support to the strategy of continuing and expanding work at Kalaka, and in particular at the K1A target and extensions.\nDavid J Reading, M.Sc., FIMM, Fellow SEG, a director of DFR and a Qualified Person as defined under NI 43-101 has prepared or supervised the preparation of, or approved, as applicable, the technical information contained in this press release.

DFR holds interests in a portfolio of West African gold exploration projects including the highly prospective Cascades gold project (\"Cascades\") in Burkina Faso. Cascades has a Mineral Resource* prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 comprising 5.41 million tonnes of indicated resources at an average grade of 1.52g/t Au for a total 264,000 ounces of gold: and 6.93 million tonnes of inferred resources at an average grade 1.67g/t Au for a total of 371,000 ounces of gold. Please see the Company's technical report titled \"Amended and Re-stated Technical Report on the Labola Project Burkina Faso\" dated April 2, 2022, with an effective date of April 20, 2022 for further information regarding Cascades. This report can be located at www.dfrgold.com.\nIn Madagascar, DFR has an advanced high grade hard rock zircon exploration prospect located in the west of the country, approximately 220km east of the port of Maintirano and close to a state road. DFR acquired Beravina from Pala Investments and Austral Resources in 2016.\nThe Company's public documents may be accessed at www.sedarplus.ca\nNeither the TSX-V nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nAdditional Mineral Resource Estimate Disclosures\n*Mineral Resources, which are not Mineral Reserves, do not have demonstrated economic viability. The estimate of Mineral Resources may be materially affected by environmental, permitting, legal, marketing, or other relevant issues. The Mineral Resources in this note were reported using CIM (2014) Standards on Mineral Resources and Reserves, Definitions and Guidelines and adopted by CIM Council.\nThe quantity and grade of reported Inferred resources in this estimation are uncertain in nature and there has been insufficient exploration to define this Inferred Resource as an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource. It is uncertain if further exploration will result in upgrading the Inferred Resource to an Indicated or Measured Mineral Resource category.\nThe Mineral Resource has been constrained by an open pit evaluation using a gold price of US$1900 per ounce, and then reported at a cut-off of 0.5 g/t Au.\nContained metal and tonnes figures in totals may differ due to rounding.\nForward-Looking Statements:\nThis release contains certain \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation.

What\u2019s more, the 2024 Central Bank Gold Reserves Survey, conducted between February and April, found that 29% of central bank respondents planned to increase their gold reserves over the next 12 months.\nThis plan is driven by \u201ca desire to rebalance to a more preferred strategic level of gold holdings, domestic gold production, and financial market concerns including higher crisis risks and rising inflation,\u201d according to the council.\nNorth American Professional Investors Raise Allocation\nBeyond central banks, North American professional investors also have upped their gold holdings and reaped rewards from higher prices. A survey of 525 such investors, in a separate World Gold Council report from late June, found that 85% reported an allocation to some type of gold investment in 2023, compared with 69% in 2018 and 76% in 2019. The report didn't include data for 2020 to 2022.\nThese professional investors \"view gold as an excellent portfolio diversifier and inflation hedge, and agree that it reduces portfolio risk,\u201d the council said.\nOutlook for Gold in Second Half\nThe spot price of gold has increased 12.7% year-to-date in 2024, ranking it among the top-performing assets. As of Tuesday at 2 p.m. ET, the price of gold was roughly $2,324, about 5% below its all-time high set in May.",

There\u2019s more talk about tariffs and sanctions on one side than the other.\nAsked whether Europe in particular would be negatively affected by a Trump victory, Mr Grande said European companies that deal closely with Chinese companies would be hurt most under a Trump presidency. Trump has said he would hike tariffs on Chinese products.\nThe domestic US economy - in which half of the fund\u2019s investments are located - would remain broadly the same, regardless of who wins the election, Grande said.\n\u201cThe difference between a Democratic and a Republican candidate ... wouldn\u2019t be as important necessarily for the US,\u201d he said.\n06:04 PM BST\nL\u2019Oreal results hit by China slump\nFrench cosmetics giant L\u2019Or\u00e9al experienced a mixed third quarter, telling investors that its North Asia region, which includes China, had shrunk by 4.4pc.\nThe company, however, grew by 6pc overall.\n\u201cOperating conditions in the Chinese ecosystem remain challenging ... In mainland China, the beauty market \u2013 already negative in the second quarter \u2013 continued to deteriorate, impacted by low consumer confidence,\u201d it said.\n05:49 PM BST\nUS stock markets experience \u2018choppiness\u2019 as S&P dips\nUS stock indexes slipped this afternoon as rising Treasury yields affected rate-sensitive sectors, while investors continued to evaluate earnings to assess the health of American companies.\nGE Aerospace slumped 7.2pc despite raising its profit forecast for 2024, as persistent supply constraints hit its revenue.\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq lost 0.3pc, while the Dow Jones was flat.\nFurther pressuring equities, US Treasury yields were trading at near three-month highs as investors repriced expectations for the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy trajectory.\nChuck Carlson, chief executive at Horizon Investment Services, said:\nDuring the earnings season, you often get this kind of choppiness, but there\u2019s also increased uncertainty relative to the interest rate direction.\n05:35 PM BST\nReeves\u2019s tax and spend Budget will cause higher interest rates, say economists\nRachel Reeves\u2019s plans for increased borrowing and spending will force the Bank of England to hold interest rates higher for longer, leading economists have said.\nPantheon Macroeconomics said that rates would be 0.25 to 0.5pc percentage points higher during the next financial year as a result of the Chancellor\u2019s looser fiscal policy.\nEconomists Robert Wood and Elliott Jordan-Doak said: \u201cThe Oct 30 Budget will include large tax increases, but we expect Chancellor Rachel Reeves overall to loosen fiscal policy, boosting growth and keeping interest rates higher than they otherwise would be.\n\u201cThe MPC [Monetary Policy Committee] can keep cutting interest rates, but Ms Reeves\u2019 Budget should keep rate-setters easing policy only gradually.\u201d\nThey added: \u201cThe growth-depressing impact of Ms Reeves\u2019 likely tax hikes is roughly cancelled out by the boost from higher day-today public spending.\n\u201cBut extra government investment funded by more borrowing means the Oct 30 Budget should add a net boost to GDP\u2026\n\u201cThe MPC, by convention, bases its forecasts on announced government policy.

French President Emmanuel Macron has repeatedly opposed concluding a trade deal.\n05:03 PM BST\nUncertainty hits stock market sentiment despite profits\nEuropean and US stock markets dipped today, as traders sought to ascertain the outlook for US interest rates ahead of the presidential election.\nInvestors also focused on company earnings, as gold and oil prices continued to rise on the back of Middle East tensions.\nDerren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said:\nA mix of continuing unrest in the Middle East and uncertainty over the US election casts a cautious shadow over markets.\nConcerns over the outcome of the US election on Nov 5 have weighed on investor sentiment, with recent polls and forecasts indicating that Donald Trump has gained ground on Kamala Harris, Deutsche Bank economists noted.\nExpectations of another bumper US interest-rate cut from the Federal Reserve have been tempered slightly following a recent run of strong American data on jobs creation and as some top decision-makers suggested they would like to see a slower pace of rate cuts.\nTech titans Alphabet and IBM announce their latest results over the next two days, while earnings from Boeing, Coca-Cola, and L\u2019Oreal are also in the pipeline.\nGeneral Motors raised some of its full-year profit projections Tuesday following solid earnings as strong vehicle pricing compensated for lower auto sales.\n3M, GE Aerospace, Lockheed Martin and Verizon also beat expectations.\nBriefing.com analyst Patrick O\u2019Hare said there is a bit of debate on why equities have retreated despite the generally good corporate earnings reports.\nOne is that a rise in market interest rates has created concerns that equities are trading at levels too high compared to their earnings.\n\u201cThe other possibility is that stocks hit some speed bumps yesterday because the market had gone up six straight weeks and was due for a pull-back,\u201d he said.\n05:01 PM BST\nFTSE 100 closes down\nThe FTSE 100 fell 0.1pc today as morning losses were mostly reversed after the IMF upgraded its forecast for the UK.\nThe biggest riser was miner Fresnillo, up 2.8pc, followed by aerospace manufacturer Melrose, which rose 2pc.\nInsurance company Admiral fell the most, losing 2pc, followed by housebuilder Persimmon, down 1.8pc.\nMeanwhile, the FTSE 250 closed up 0.2pc. Construction group Morgan Sindall rose 20pc, while Wizz Air gained 6.9pc.\nAt the other end of the index, supplier to the oil and gas industries Hunting plunged 16.5pc, while City firm Bridgepoint lost 2.9pc.\n04:55 PM BST\nJPMorgan chief would consider a role in Harris administration, report says\nWall Street heavyweight Jamie Dimon would consider a role in Kamala Harris\u2019 administration, according to a report.\nThe New York Times claimed that the boss of banking giant JPMorgan has privately suggested he would be open to a role, perhaps that of the Treasury Secretary.\nA spokesman for JPMorgan told the NYT that Mr Dimon \u201chas never publicly endorsed a presidential candidate\u201d. JPMorgan declined to comment further to The Telegraph.\nAt JPMorgan\u2019s post-earnings report call earlier this month, Mr Dimon said the chance of him being asked to take up a government role was \u201calmost nil\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cAnd I probably am not going to do it. But I always reserve the right [to reconsider].\u201d\n04:27 PM BST\nChina lacks clear policies to fix low consumer spending, says Yellen\nUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Tuesday said she has not yet seen policies announced by China that would address its low level of consumer spending as a share of its economy.\nShe told a press conference in Washington DC:\nOur view has been that raising consumer spending in China as a share of GDP (gross domestic product) is really important, along with measures to address problems in the property sector.\n04:24 PM BST\nGermany\u2019s 10-year bond yield hits two-month high\nGermany\u2019s 10-year bond yield rose to its highest level in almost two months today, tracking US Treasury notes, as a range of factors including doubts about the speed rate cuts.\nGermany\u2019s 10-year bond yield, the benchmark for the euro zone, rose as high as 2.334pc, the highest since Sept 3. The yield was 2.289pc late last night.\nBond market analysts have struggled to pinpoint an exact driver for the rise in longer-dated bond yields in Europe and the United States.\nBut they have pointed to stronger than expected US economic data causing traders to moderate their expectations for rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. In addition, a rise in oil prices and concerns about high levels of bonds being issued as governments run large budget deficits appear to be having an effect.\nPadhraic Garvey, regional head of research for the Americas at ING, said European bond markets were being \u201cbullied\u201d by US Treasury yields, which have risen as investors have reduced their bets on quick Fed rate cuts.\n04:19 PM BST\nXi tells Putin the world is in chaos but friendship with Russia will endure\nChinese President Xi Jinping told Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin that the international situation was gripped by chaos but that Beijing\u2019s strategic partnership with Moscow was a force for stability.\n\u201cAt present, the world is going through changes unseen in a hundred years, the international situation is intertwined with chaos,\u201d Xi told Putin today in the Russian city of Kazan at the opening of the BRICS summit.\n\u201cBut I firmly believe that the friendship between China and Russia will continue for generations, and great countries\u2019 responsibility to their people will not change.\u201d\nThe United States casts China as its biggest competitor and Russia as its biggest nation-state threat, and President Joe Biden has said the democracies face a challenge from autocracies such as China and Russia.\nBiden has referred to Xi as a \u201cdictator\u201d and has said Putin is a \u201ckiller\u201d and even a \u201ccrazy SOB\u201d. Beijing and Moscow have scolded Biden for the comments.\nPutin called Xi \u201cdear friend\u201d and claimed the partnership with China was a force for stability in the world.\n\u201cRussian-Chinese cooperation in world affairs is one of the main stabilising factors on the world stage,\u201d Mr Putin said.\n04:08 PM BST\nIMF helps FTSE 100 recoup losses\nThe FTSE 100 is currently down 0.1pc, having fallen as much as 0.8pc today.\nChris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform IG, credits the IMF with helping the index recoup most of its earlier losses.

The services component dropped to 4.9pc from 5.6pc.\nShe said:\nServices inflation ... was the biggest surprise, actually in the latest print.\nBut she wanted that this was affected by volatile date \u201cso I wouldn\u2019t put too much weight on that\u201d.\nMs Greene voted against the BoE\u2019s first rate cut of its current loosening cycle in August.\n03:47 PM BST\nUS stock market \u2018unsure of what\u2019s next\u2019\nUS stocks are retreating from record highs this week as investors take a breather after weeks of advances for major indexes.\nJ.J. Kinahan, chief executive of IG Group North America, said:\nWe set all these new highs with a sense of nervousness. That\u2019s for three primary reasons: a lot of conflicts around the world at the moment, the Fed and what they\u2019re going to do next and the election ... [have] people a bit more unsure of what\u2019s next.\nThe next few weeks are likely to be volatile for equity markets, as investors scrutinise company earnings, fresh economic data and the results of the US election, followed by a central bank meeting.\nTraders are pricing in an 89.6pc chance of a quarter percentage point interest rate cut in November, according to CME\u2019s FedWatch.\n03:38 PM BST\nWall Street dips amid interest rate worries\nThe S&P 500 dropped 0.4pc as it opened this afternoon as investors look towards election and paired back bets on fast interest rate cuts.\nIt follows a fall yesterday and gives investors the first back-to-back decline in six weeks.\nThe Dow Jones dropped by a similar amount, while the Nasdaq was down by less than 0.1pc.\n03:31 PM BST\nArm boss \u2018open to\u2019 secondary listing in UK\nThe boss of British technology giant Arm has said he would be \u201copen to\u201d a potential secondary listing in London more than a year after it shunned the City for New York.\nChief executive Rene Haas indicated the Cambridge-based company could make the move after making the biggest public listing on Wall Street last year, spurning advances by then-prime minister Rishi Sunak.\nMr Sunak had repeatedly lobbied Arm to float in London, either as its main market or through a dual listing. Officials had reportedly offered to bend listing rules to attract the company.\nMr Haas also told the Bloomberg Tech Summit that he does not think AI is overhyped.\nHe said: \u201cThe amount of innovation it\u2019s going to drive is just incredible.\u201d\nI am heading off now but the live updates will keep coming courtesy of the rapid-typing Alex Singleton.\n03:10 PM BST\nUK growth driven by higher immigration, says IMF\nThe IMF forecasts suggested growth was still being fuelled by a growing population and higher immigration, writes Szu Ping Chan.\nThe IMF projections showed Sir Keir Starmer remained far away from his target of having the fastest growing economy in the G7 for two consecutive years, measured by GDP per head, growing by just 0.6pc this year and 1.1pc in 2025 on a per capita basis.\nBy contrast, US GDP per head is projected to grow by 2.3pc this year and 1.7pc in 2025. GDP per head - which is used as a proxy for living standards - is projected to shrink this year in Germany and Canada.\n03:00 PM BST\nTax hikes could damage growth, IMF warns Reeves\nRachel Reeves has been warned that huge tax hikes or spending cuts risk damaging growth in a move that will make the challenge of bringing down debt harder.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) said countries including the UK that attempt to do \u201ctoo much too quickly\u201d on tax rises and spending cuts risked having an \u201cadverse impact on growth\u201d.\nHowever, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, also fired a warning shot at the Chancellor\u2019s plans to borrow more to invest, signalling that there was still a \u201cneed to bring debt levels down\u201d in countries such as the UK.\nMr Gourinchas said: \u201cIf you\u2019re not doing that, that\u2019s when you find yourself potentially later on at the mercy of market pressures. That will force an adjustment that is uncontrolled to a large extent, at which point you have very few degrees of freedom. So you don\u2019t want to get in that position. And I think the effort to stabilise public debt has to be seen in that context.\u201d\nMs Reeves is widely expected to change how debt is defined in the budget in order to reflect the benefits of investment as well as the costs.\nMr Gourinchas stressed there was a fine balance to be struck on getting debt down, adding that protecting public investment was important.\n\u201cIf you try to do too much too quickly, you might have an adverse impact on growth. And you have to be careful there, because most countries have important needs when it comes to spending, whether it\u2019s about essential services, or if we think about public investment and the climate transition. So we need to protect also the type of spending that can be good for growth.\u201d\n02:50 PM BST\nUS economy growing because Biden ended isolationism, says Yellen\nUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen made a thinly-veiled attack on Donald Trump\u2019s tariff-based economic plans if he wins the presidential election as she spoke at the IMF and World Bank annual meeting.\nThe former Federal Reserve chair told world financial leaders that the US economy has grown stronger because Joe Biden\u2019s administration rejected isolationism.\nMs Yellen opened the IMF and World Bank annual meetings by highlighting US economic growth since the nation was in the grips of the Covid pandemic.\nWithout mentioning Trump by name, she said in an advance draft of her remarks that the Biden administration had ended a period of international isolationism that \u201cmade America and the world worse off\u201d.\nShe said: \u201cWe went from millions having lost their jobs to a historic labour market recovery,\u201d\nShe said US economic growth has been \u201calmost twice as fast as most other advanced economies this year and last, even as inflation came down sooner\u201d.\n02:41 PM BST\nWall

down and its joint venture in China losing money.\nThe Detroit carmaker, which is behind brands like Chevrolet and Buick, reported $48.8bn (\u00a337.6bn) in revenue from July through September, which was 10pc more than last year.\nChief financial officer Paul Jacobson said that while overall sales in the US fell 2.2pc in the quarter, much of the drop in GM\u2019s most-profitable market was from sales to large fleet buyers.\nSales to individuals, which generally are more profitable, rose 3pc.\nHowever, the company\u2019s joint venture in China lost $137m, compared with a $192m profit a year ago.\nMr Jacobson said the loss is a symptom of tough market conditions there, where domestic brands are turning out well-built products at low costs.\n01:13 PM BST\nIntercontinental Hotels boosts revenues despite China slump\nHoliday Inn owner Intercontinental Hotel Group (IHG) increased its revenues per room despite a significant slump in China.\nElie Maalouf, chief executive of IHG hotels

Hotel Indigo brands, revealed that global revenues per available room rose 1.5oc over the third quarter of 2024.\nBosses said growth was boosted by \u201chealthy business demand\u201d.\nShares were up 1pc as the company saw particularly strong growth in Europe and Asia, where revenue per available room was up 4.9pc, with occupancy and room rates both increasing year-on-year.\nHowever, the company

ounce, while sliver gained 1.6pc to tip over $34.\nUsually, rises in Treasury yields hurts the price of gold as they pay no interest compared to government bonds.\nBas Kooijman, chief executive of DHF Capital, said: \u201cWith the US presidential election just over two weeks away, polls suggest that former President Donald Trump\u2019s chances of winning are increasing.\n\u201cThis possibility is prompting investors to seek more safe-haven assets like gold to hedge against potential controversial policies he might implement, which could impact inflation, monetary policy, and global trade.\u201d\n12:27 PM BST\nWall Street drops as Trump predicted to win election\nUS stock markets are on track to fall at the opening bell as fears about a Trump victory sent bond yields

better wages to help the country\u2019s \u201cstagnating\u201d economy.\nThe Chancellor urged businesses to attract skilled workers from abroad to reignite growth, after his government predicted Europe\u2019s largest economy is heading for its first two-year recession since the early 2000s.\nMr Scholz\u2019s administration has eased immigration rules to help companies bring in more talent

receipts ahead of Budget raid\nThe Chancellor raked in a record \u00a32.2bn in inheritance tax receipts in the three months to September, ahead of an expected raid in Rachel Reeves\u2019 maiden Budget next week.\nInheritance tax brought in \u00a3736m for the Chancellor last month alone, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), taking the haul so far this financial year to almost \u00a34.3bn \u2013 up more than 10pc compared with the same period last year.\nMs Reeves is reportedly considering a string of changes to the much-hated \u201cdeath tax\u201d which is typically charged at a rate of 40pc on assets above the threshold of \u00a3325,000 when someone dies.\nShe is understood to be considering extending the current \u201cseven-year\u201d rule \u2013 under which

vacancies shrink as Budget fears put brakes on hiring\nThe number of professional roles being advertised in the UK has fallen as bosses decided to defer hiring until they see the results of the Chancellor\u2019s tax-raising Budget.\nBritain was among the nations suffering the largest declines in white-collar job vacancies amid fears about the economic outlook, according to industry data.\nThe UK suffered a 5.6pc drop in job roles being advertised, ahead of the global average of 5pc but behind drops of 21.8pc in Singapore, 12.1pc in the USA, 11.3pc in Australia and 6.9pc in Germany.\nThe decline in September is particularly concerning as September is typically deemed one of the busiest months for recruitment.\nToby Fowlston, chief executive of Robert Walters, which

yield on Australian benchmark debt surged as much as 16 basis points.\nIt comes amid increasing bets that Donald Trump - who has championed inflationary economic policies, such as tariffs - is leading the race for the White House.\nAccording to Polymarket, the Republican candidate has a nearly 65pc chance of winning the November 5 election, compared to less than 36pc for Kamala Harris.\nHigher inflation would likely force the US Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher for longer after announcing a first reduction in four years in September.\nRobert Dishner, senior portfolio manager at

acute.\u201d\n10:00 AM BST\nHalfords says customers are holding back on big-ticket purchases\nHalfords has cautioned that uncertainty about the economy and upcoming tax changes mean consumers are still holding back from making costlier purchases.\nThe retailer, which sells bicycles and car parts, said sales growth stalled over the six months to September 27, dipping 0.1pc.\nThis was partly due to there being significantly stronger demand during 2023, particularly for its garages which saw a big jump in vehicle-servicing sales.\nOver the latest period, Halfords said there was still strong growth for services, maintenance and repairs, but tyre fitting was more flat with cost-conscious shoppers turning to budget ranges instead.\nThe company, which is expecting to make savings worth \u00a330m this year, also said record levels of rainfall over the spring contributed to weaker retail sales, which dipped 0.7pc year-on-year, with leisure cycling demand coming under pressure.\nHowever, shares were up 5.5pc as the retailer, which runs about 380 shops across the UK and nearly 550 garages, revealed there were signs of consumer sentiment improving.\nIt warned people were still spending cautiously, particularly on more expensive, so-called big ticket purchases.\nGraham Stapleton, Halford\u2019s chief executive, said consumers \u201cremain cautious in their discretionary spending compounded by uncertainty around the contents of the upcoming autumn Budget\u201d, but that the group was focused on \u201ccontrolling the controllables\u201d.\n09:43 AM

Britain\u2019s debt did not breach 100pc of GDP after all last month, although at 98.5pc of GDP it remains at the highest level since the early 1960s.\nPublic sector net debt excluding banks edged down slightly to \u00a32.77 trillion in September.\n09:28 AM BST\nMulberry shares drop as it rejects \u2018untenable\u2019 Frasers bid\nMulberry shares have fallen after it said a sweetened \u00a3111m approach from Mike Ashley\u2019s Frasers Group is \u201cuntenable\u201d.\nThe London-listed fashion company said its board had decided to rebuff the higher proposed takeover in favour of focusing on boosting its business performance.\nIt said this also takes into account the view of its largest shareholder, Challice - a group controlled by Singaporean entrepreneur Christina Ong and husband Ong Beng Seng - which has already rejected the approach, saying it does not plan to sell to Frasers.\nShares were down 3.9pc as Mulberry said: \u201cAfter careful consideration with its advisers... the board is unanimously of the view that the possible offer is untenable and that the company should focus its attention on driving the commercial performance of the business.\u201d\nFrasers now has

250 dropped 0.2pc.\nAndrew Bailey will give a speech in New York later, while fellow policymaker Megan Greene will be on a panel at the Atlantic Council.\nTheir speeches come after inflation dropped further than expected to 1.7pc in September, paving the way for more interest rate cuts.\nIn corporate news, HSBC was down 0.1pc after it unveiled an overhaul of its global structure as new boss Georges Elhedery looks to reduce costs and home in on the bank\u2019s strongest divisions.\n08:43 AM BST\nBurden of fixing public finances must not fall on hard working households, urge Lib Dems\nAmid soaring public borrowing, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Daisy Cooper said:\nToday\u2019s figures highlight the difficult position of our public finances after years of mismanagement under the previous Conservative government - but this can\u2019t be an excuse for the Chancellor to make the wrong decisions at the Budget.\n08:31 AM BST\nReeves urged to amend fiscal rules as Treasury overspends\nRachel Reeves has signalled plans to announce changes in the upcoming Budget to the fiscal rules, which provide discipline on borrowing and spending, to allow her to borrow more to finance projects in sectors such as housing, roads and energy.\nExperts said the rules will need to be changed as government spending soars but in a way that does not spook financial markets and risk a re-run of the mini-Budget meltdown caused by former prime minister Liz Truss.\nThe Resolution Foundation economic think tank said Government spending so far this financial year was \u00a311.5bn more than forecast by the OBR, which tallies with Ms Reeves\u2019 claim of a \u00a322bn \u201cblack hole\u201d in the public finances.\nThe foundation\u2019s senior economist Cara Pacitti said: \u201cToday\u2019s data highlights the scale of the public finances challenges facing the Chancellor as she grapples with overspending today, the need to avoid austerity in the future, and having to fund extra public service spending through tax rises.\u201d\nRob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he expects the Chancellor to target public sector net financial liabilities falling relative to GDP in five years, rather than public sector debt excluding the Bank of England.\nHe said: \u201cChanging the fiscal rules in that way would give the Government about \u00a350bn additional headroom to borrow.\n\u201cWe think markets will be unruffled by that change because boosting investment should raise GDP, making government borrowing more affordable.\u201d\n08:19 AM BST\nHSBC breaks up bank amid growing tensions between China and the West\nHSBC has unveiled a sweeping overhaul of its bank separating its UK division from its Asia business amid growing geopolitical tensions between China and the West.\nThe lender on Tuesday announced that it will be \u201csimplifying\u201d its geographical governance structure, splitting its business into eastern and western markets.\nUnder the plans, which are being spearheaded by HSBC\u2019s new chief executive Georges Elhedery, eastern markets will contain the Asia-Pacific region and the Middle East while western markets will contain its UK and continental European and Americas businesses.\nIt is the first major shake-up by Mr Elhedery, who was appointed in July and is HSBC\u2019s first Mandarin-speaking chief executive.\n08:11 AM BST\nUK markets slump as public sector borrowing surges\nThe FTSE 100 began the day lower as the latest official figures showed the \u201cweak state\u201d of the public finances.\nThe UK\u2019s blue-chip index dropped 0.4pc to 8,286.78 while the midcap FTSE 250 fell 0.1pc to 20,893.48.\nAlison Ring, ICAEW director of public sector and taxation, said: \u201cToday\u2019s data shows that the government spent \u00a380bn more than it took in from taxes and other receipts in the six months to September 30.\n\u201cThis was the third highest on record, \u00a37bn more than budgeted and \u00a31bn more than in the first half of the previous financial year, emphasising the weak state of the public finances ahead of the new Chancellor\u2019s first Budget next week.\n\u201cPublic sector net debt hit \u00a32,767bn, or 98.5pc of GDP, on track to exceed \u00a32.8tn by the end of the financial year, although updated GDP estimates resulted in debt falling back below 100pc of GDP.\n\u201cWhile the Autumn Budget next week is technically about the plan for the next financial year, there will be significant attention on the updated estimates for the current financial year, and the extent to which the new Chancellor has been able to mitigate the \u00a322bn black hole.\n\u201cWe hope the Chancellor will use the Budget as an opportunity to fix the underlying debt measure to allow for an increase in the investment the UK needs for growth, as part of a long-term fiscal strategy that puts the public finances on a sustainable footing.\u201d\n07:52 AM BST\nPublic sector pay deals poised to deepen borrowing pain, say economists\nThe impact of public sector pay deals on the public finances is likely to become more severe in the coming months, economists have warned.\nThe ONS said public sector pay deals were one of the reason that Treasury borrowing has overshot OBR forecasts by \u00a36.7bn in the six months to September.\nHowever, Alex Kerr of Capital Economics said that \u201cit is worth noting that this is unlikely to be because of the public sector pay deals announced by the Chancellor in July as they are likely to come into effect from October\u201d.\nHe added that today\u2019s release means borrowing \u201cis on track to overshoot the OBR\u2019s 2024/25 forecast of \u00a387.2bn by \u00a36.6bn\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cThis demonstrates the constraints on the Chancellor\u2019s ability to increase day-to-day spending in the Budget next week without raising taxes.\n\u201cIndeed, we expect her to increase current (i.e. excluding investment) spending by a net \u00a325bn a year and to fund that by raising taxes by \u00a325bn.\n\u201cHowever, if the Chancellor changes the measure of debt her fiscal rule targets, she may be able to borrow to increase public investment by up to \u00a353bn. For what it\u2019s worth, we think she will raise borrowing and public investment by \u00a318bn in 2029/30.\u201d\n07:37 AM BST\nTreasury hit with higher debt interest payments\nThe interest the Treasury has to pay on Government debt rose from \u00a34.6bn a year ago to \u00a35.6bn last month, according to the ONS.\nStatisticians said this was owing to the interest payable in September last year being exceptionally low at \u00a3900m because of movements in the retail price index measure of inflation around that time, rather than September 2024\u2019s interest being unusually high.\n07:31 AM BST\nIt was right to fund public sector pay deals, says minister\nAs the Government borrowed more than forecast by the OBR, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones said:\nWe have inherited a \u00a322bn black hole in the country\u2019s public finances, including no plan to fund pay deals for millions of public sector workers.\n07:23 AM BST\nPublic sector pay rises fueled rising borrowing, says ONS\nAs public sector borrowing soared, ONS deputy director for public sector finances Jessica Barnaby said:\nBorrowing this month was about \u00a32bn up on last year, making this the third highest September figure on record.\n07:21 AM BST\nUK borrowing soars as Reeves scrambles to plug \u00a340bn black hole\nThe Treasury\u2019s borrowing has risen as Rachel Reeves scrambles to fill a \u00a340bn black hole in the public finances.\nThe Government has borrowed \u00a36.7bn more so far in this financial year than was forecast by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), delivering the Chancellor less room for her sweeping spending and investment plans.\nPublic sector net borrowing excluding banks stood at \u00a379.6bn in the six months to September, which was \u00a31.2bn more the same point last year, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nFor the month of September, total public sector net borrowing excluding public sector banks was \u00a316.6bn, which was lower than economists\u2019 expectations of \u00a317.5bn.\nHowever, September borrowing was \u00a31.2bn more than a year ago and it was the third biggest September deficit since records began in 1993.\nMeanwhile, the public borrowing figure for August was revised down from \u00a313.7bn to \u00a313bn.\nPublic sector net debt excluding public sector banks reached around 98.5pc of the UK\u2019s annual gross domestic product (GDP).\n07:19 AM BST\nGood morning\nThanks for joining me. Public sector borrowing has surged higher than official forecasts as Rachel Reeves prepares to plug a \u00a340bn \u201cblack hole\u201d in the Treasury\u2019s finances in her Budget.\nThe Government has borrowed \u00a36.7bn more so far this financial year than had been forecase by the Office for Budget Responsibility, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n5 things to start your day\n1) Reeves tax raid risks \u00a384bn black hole in public finances, say Truss-backed economists | The Growth Commission says higher duties would weigh on growth and leave the average person poorer\n2) Rayner\u2019s workers\u2019 rights overhaul to cost employers up to \u00a35bn a year | Government\u2019s own impact assessment predicts businesses may be forced to raise prices and cut wages\n3) Paddington producer targets \u00a36.7bn listing in boost for London stock market | Floating of Canal+ would make it largest debut of year and meet threshold for FTSE 100\n4) The little-known rail project giving Reeves a \u00a3500m headache | Transport bosses fear dire consequences if a crucial upgrade to Ely Junction fails to win funding\n5) Ben Marlow: Self-driving cars are just another Silicon Valley obsession that no one needs | The problem with robotaxis isn\u2019t just their safety concerns, but whether there is a market for them in the first place\nWhat happened overnight\nAsian shares outside of China declined in cautious trading ahead of earnings reports both in the region and overseas, after Wall Street\u2019s long, record-breaking rally ran out of steam.\nJapan\u2019s benchmark Nikkei 225 fell 1.1pc to 38,496.44.

His sin of commission was to order the Bank of England to sell over half its gold reserves at the absolute bottom of the market \u2013 for a 10th of its current value \u2013 in order to buy fiat paper euros.\nHis larger sin of omission was not to buy gold by the cart-load when others were giving it away, which would also have stopped sterling becoming so overvalued and hollowing out British industry in the early to mid-2000s. As it was, Britain went into the Lehman crisis with almost no reserves of any kind. It still has a wafer-thin safety buffer, courting fate in our dystopian new world.\nToday\u2019s gold market is itself a herald of this menacing disorder. The correlations of the last half century have gone haywire. Gold has been rising in lockstep with its arch-nemesis \u2013 the US dollar \u2013 reaching an all-time high of $2,790 a week ago. It refuses to retreat when bond yields spike.\n\u201cThere is something very mysterious about this market move,\u201d said Ross Norman, a bullion veteran and founder of Metals Daily. \u201cGold is rising onwards and upwards with scarcely a pause for breath. Speculators would normally take profits on the way.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cYou could ask a 10-year US treasury note what the gold price should be and it would tell you about half the current price. The action is heedless of traditional drivers, it has massive conviction, and it is largely opaque.\u201d\nExperts can account for only half of the 2845 tonnes of supply from mines and scrap since the rally took off seven months ago. Central banks did triple purchases in 2022 and 2023 but have since stepped back, reporting just 136 tonnes of net purchases since March. They buy in an orderly fashion and do not chase the price. The Chinese central bank has bought no gold for five months (officially).\nIndia has imported 420 tonnes, mostly for jewellery. Chinese domestic demand has absorbed 730 tonnes. There are bits and bobs from ETF funds and German libertarians, and \u201cspec longs\u201d on the Chicago Mercantile. The sums do not add up.\n\u201cIt is very hard to buy very significant amounts of gold without leaving any footprint, so this rally is confounding everybody,\u201d he said.\nWhoever is buying, the bull run has geopolitics and fiscal revulsion written all over it. The G7 decision to freeze $300bn of Russian reserves in 2022 stunned the Global South. So did Russia\u2019s expulsion from the Swift payments system, accompanied by the threat of secondary sanctions against any bank or company, anywhere.\nIt told every authoritarian across the planet to diversify out of US treasuries, gilts, bonds, and into physical gold, held in vaults beyond the long arm of the West.\nNo country likes being at the mercy of the US financial cycle in any case. \u201cEvery night I ask myself: who decided that the world currency should be the dollar after the end of the gold standard?\u201d said Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, president of Brazil, last year.\nYet Putin failed to secure backing for his Brics currency at his summit in Kazan two weeks ago. Russia has been pushing for a new reserve note \u2013 the \u201cunit\u201d \u2013 backed by 40pc gold and 60pc from a currency basket, a sort of Bretton Woods II. All he got was vague talk of using local currencies more widely.\nThere is a school of thought that we are starting to see defensive action by the holders of wealth against runaway public debts in America, Europe and Japan, pushed closer to the point of no return by the fiscal trauma of Covid.\nThe path of least political resistance for chronic debtors is to erode the burden via inflation, and when investors refuse to take it any more, by means of financial repression.\nThe International Monetary Fund says global public debt will hit $100 trillion in 2024. The US is running a budget deficit of 7.6pc of GDP this year and will continue running deficits above 6pc through this decade, pushing the debt ratio 132pc in 2029 even if Washington behaves, which it will not.\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says Donald Trump\u2019s unfunded tax cuts would add another $8 trillion to the US debt over a decade, and Kamala Harris\u2019s unfunded spending would add $4 trillion. The fiscal profiles of China and Brazil are not much better.\nYet the puzzle remains. Half the gold-buying since March is off books, via proxies, contriving to avoid detection, which raises an unpleasant possibility: is this really about China accumulating a war chest for a showdown with the West, presumably at a well-chosen moment as Russian forces close in on an exhausted Ukraine?\nThe fear in strategic circles is that Xi Jinping will impose a \u201ccustoms blockade\u201d on Taiwan, controlling the supply of semiconductors and asserting sovereignty short of an outright invasion. Any hesitation by Washington (probable) would lead to the collapse of US credibility across East Asia.\nFor the last three years, Russia, China, Iran and North Korea have been operating in collusion and on a war footing, each fostering belligerent hyper-nationalism as a means of regime survival, and all aiming to press their advantage before the West gets a grip.\nThe democracies, lost in their culture wars, have not responded by putting their societies on an equal war footing to deter this opportunistic escalation. If we are indeed drifting towards a fundamental and violent convulsion of the post-war global order, wouldn\u2019t you expect gold to go parabolic?",

        "full_text": "Five Key Charts to Watch in Global Commodities This Week\n(Bloomberg) -- It\u2019s another busy earnings period with reports coming from Big Oil firms BP Plc and TotalEnergies SE, as well as Bunge Global SA, Orsted A/S and ArcelorMittal SA. Crop traders will focus on the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s monthly report on global supply and demand, with particular attention to South America\u2019s soybean harvest. In the US, President Joe Biden\u2019s decision to freeze approvals of new liquefied natural gas export licenses is under fire.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\nKing Charles Treated for Cancer in New Health Scare for Monarchy\nChina Tightens Some Trading Restrictions for Domestic and Offshore Investors\nEastern Europe\u2019s Richest Woman Pivots $43 Billion Empire West\nBonds Fall After \u2018One-Two Punch\u2019 of ISM, Fedspeak: Markets Wrap\nHere are five notable charts to consider in global commodity markets as the week gets underway.\nNatural Gas\nThere are growing calls to reverse Biden\u2019s LNG decision, with moderate Democrats now urging the president to \u201crefocus\u201d his policy. On Tuesday, EQT Corp. Chief Executive Officer Toby Rice will testify at a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing. The head of the largest US natural gas producer has been critical of the move, saying it will result in higher emissions and hurt global energy security. The Senate will hold a separate hearing on Thursday, led by West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin. Meanwhile, Exxon Mobil Corp.\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Kathy Mikells called the halt a \u201cmistake.\u201d This moratorium affects LNG companies needing final US approval to export to countries without free trade agreements, a necessary permit to move forward with customers and financing. Wood Mackenzie estimates another group of projects will require extensions of their existing permits before 2027, totaling almost the same amount of capacity as projects waiting for non-FTA approval.\nShale\nIt\u2019s a good time to be working in the US shale patch. While explorers are planning to keep drilling budgets relatively flat this year, their labor costs seem to remain in growth mode. Average hourly earnings for front-line oil-and-gas workers are now the highest ever. It\u2019s a key measure to watch as shale explorers push for greater efficiency by pulling more production from fewer drilling and frack crews.\nAgriculture\nSoybean futures traded in Chicago are being walloped on slowing US exports and competition from Brazil, where the harvest is expected to be the second-largest on record. That has helped prop up expectations for a 12% boost in production for all of South America to a record 217.3 million metric tons in the current season. Traders will await the USDA\u2019s World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report on Thursday for the latest assessment of foreign harvests.\nMetals\nSpot gold has been trading in a sideways pattern above $2,000 a ounce this year as traders weigh the outlook for Federal Reserve monetary policy. That wait-and-see approach is further evident when looking at trends in bullion-backed exchange-traded funds, which investors continue to shun. January marked the eighth straight month of outflows, the longest such streak since a year ago. While the weakness is likely to continue in the short term, a turnaround may unfold mid-year, helped by expected rate cuts by key global central banks and ongoing geopolitical risks, according to the World Gold Council. The non-interest bearing metal typically benefits from looser monetary policy when Treasury yields are lower and the dollar tends to be weaker. Spot gold fell on Monday.\nShipping\nShip traffic near Africa\u2019s Cape of Good Hope remains elevated as vessels avoid the risks associated with transit through the Red Sea. Despite logging hundreds of extra miles and enduring higher costs, the total number of ships embarking on this alternate route has surged from a year ago, according to IMF PortWatch, which analyzes daily satellite vessel location and movement data. French container shipping giant CMA CGM SA became the latest to suspend operations through the Red Sea because of the threat of attacks by Iran-backed Houthi militants.\n--With assistance from Yvonne Yue Li, David Wethe, Gerson Freitas Jr., Michael Hirtzer, Ruth Liao and Jennifer A.

The two metals often trade in lockstep, and that was true again this week.\nThere were several drivers of the increase in silver. The first was rising tension in the Middle East, which can send investors toward \"safer\" investments like precious metals. This is a big reason gold was up this week, but inflation played a role as well.\nPolicymakers were on the speaking tour this week, warning that rates may stay higher for longer than expected in 2024. The Federal Reserve wants to keep rates high to combat inflation and continues putting off potential cuts, surprising the market this year.\nMetals like gold and silver are often seen as an inflation hedge, so if inflation is higher than expected, it makes sense that both are up this week.\nLeverage in the metals business\nMiners can often move in the same direction as the commodity they're producing, but in the case of silver miners, the move is magnified because there's a lot of leverage in the business.\nYou can see in the chart that these companies are not particularly high in free cash flow despite Pan American, Fortuna, and First Majestic all generating significant revenue. That's because there are significant fixed costs in the mining business.\nThe two levers the company has to increase revenue are the volume of silver and gold produced and the price of the underlying commodity. As silver rose, these stocks followed, and if the trend holds, it will ultimately lead to higher cash flow and earnings.\nBut the financial improvement may also take time to flow through the income statement, as hedges dampen some of the price change and the delay between commodity movements and operations takes time.\nVolatility continues\nExpect miners to follow the price of gold and silver, which have suddenly become hot commodities in 2024. But that could reverse course if the Fed feels inflation is under control or investors find better prospects elsewhere.",

Her forecast for the 2024 average gold price was raised by $150 to $2,200 an ounce.\nHowever, while the market may not exactly \"go cocoa\", analysts retain a bullish tone even as technically the market feels ripe for hefty falls due to it being overbought.\n\"It is hard to say where values are going to top out as there are no resistance \"signposts\" on the charts,\" said Marex analyst, Edward Meir.\nGold's April rally came on top of its 9.3% jump in March, the strongest since July 2020, which unfolded despite traditional macro headwinds such as a strong dollar and elevated U.S. real interest rates.\nOver-the-counter and futures gold markets have been buoyant, with an estimated 40% rise in trading volumes, said Johan Palmberg, senior quantitative analyst at the World Gold Council.\n\"And there is outsized activity in the gold options market, in comparison with the likes of equities and bonds, which implies that the current interest is specifically in gold.\"\nFurther out, many analysts expect gold to test new highs once the U.S. Federal Reserve starts cutting key rates triggering demand from investors sitting on the sidelines such as holders of physically-backed gold exchange traded funds (ETFs).\n\"We had previously proposed a $2,400 per ounce price estimate if the Fed cut rates in the first quarter of 2024; we commit to that estimate for this year, even if rate cuts come later,\" analysts at BofA said in a note.\n(Reporting by Polina Devitt; editing by Veronica Brown, Pratima Desai and David Evans)",

The Company will fund US$1,000,000 per year towards initiatives that promote environmental sustainability and address social needs within surrounding communities. This commitment will start upon commencement of commercial production or within 24 months from the issuance of a mining license, whichever would come first.\nAll of these initiatives highlight the Company's dedication to sustainable mining development, which minimizes environmental impacts, positively impacts the communities we work in and creates lasting benefits for Guyana.\nThe Company is moving forward with development studies to advance Oko West towards a construction decision.
